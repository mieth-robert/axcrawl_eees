            <h2>Probing the collective excitations of excitonic insulators in an optical cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elahe Davari, Mehdi Kargarian</p>
            <p>The light--matter interaction in optical cavities offers a promising ground to create hybrid states and manipulate material properties. In this work, we examine the effect of light-matter coupling in the excitonic insulator phase using a quasi one-dimensional lattice model with two opposite parity orbitals at each site. We show that the model allows for a coupling between the collective phase mode and cavity photons. Our findings reveal that the collective mode of the excitonic state significantly impacts the dispersion of the cavity mode, giving rise to an avoiding band crossing in the photon dispersion. This phenomenon is absent in trivial and topological insulator phases and also in phonon-mediated excitonic insulators, underscoring the unique characteristics of collective excitations in excitonic insulators. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of light-matter interaction on photon propagation in the presence of excitonic collective excitations.</p>

            <h2>Time Symmetries of Quantum Memory Improve Thermodynamic Efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander B. Boyd, Paul M. Riechers</p>
            <p>Classical computations inherently require energy dissipation that increases significantly as the reliability of the computation improves. This dissipation arises when transitions between memory states are not balanced by their time-reversed counterparts. While classical memories exhibit a discrete set of possible time-reversal symmetries, quantum memory offers a continuum. This continuum enables the design of quantum memories that minimize irreversibility. As a result, quantum memory reduces energy dissipation several orders of magnitude below classical memory.</p>

            <h2>Time-domain study of coupled collective excitations in quantum materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenhang Xu, Alfred Zong</p>
            <p>Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that are often traced to a complex interplay among different microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanism and guided us in manipulating the dynamical property of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanism between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to further discoveries regarding the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Finite strain continuum phenomenological model describing the shape-memory effects in multi-phase semi-crystalline networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Arricca, Nicoletta Inverardi, Stefano Pandini, Maurizio Toselli, Massimo Messori, Giulia Scalet</p>
            <p>Thermally-driven semi-crystalline polymer networks are capable to achieve both the one-way shape-memory effect and two-way shape-memory effect under stress and stress-free conditions, therefore representing an appealing class of polymers for applications requiring autonomous reversible actuation and shape changes. In these materials, the shape-memory effects are achieved by leveraging the synergistic interaction between one or more crystalline phases and the surrounding amorphous ones that are present within the network itself. The present paper introduces a general framework for the finite strain continuum phenomenological modeling of the thermo-mechanical and shape-memory behavior of multi-phase semi-crystalline polymer networks. Model formulation, including the definition of phase and control variables, kinematic assumptions, and constitutive specifications, is introduced and thoroughly discussed. Theoretical derivations are general and easily adaptable to all cross-linked systems which include two or more crystalline domains or a single crystalline phase with a wide melting range and manifest macroscopically the one-way shape-memory effect and the two-way shape-memory effect under stress and stress-free conditions. Model capabilities are validated against experimental data for copolymer networks with two different crystalline phases characterized by well-separated melting and crystallization transitions. Results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model in predicting all the phenomena involved and in furnishing a useful support for future material and application design purposes.</p>

            <h2>High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shichao Qi, Jun Ge, Chengcheng Ji, Yiwen Ai, Gaoxing Ma, Ziqiao Wang, Zihan Cui, Yi Liu, Ziqiang Wang, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Time-reversal symmetry breaking fractional quantum spin Hall insulator in moir\'e MoTe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaifei Kang, Yichen Qiu, Bowen Shen, Kihong Lee, Zhengchao Xia, Yihang Zeng, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jie Shan, Kin Fai Mak</p>
            <p>Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moiré lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}<1 all the way to {\nu}>6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels in a deep-subwavelength hyperbolic phonon polariton cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gian Marcello Andolina, Matteo Ceccanti, Bianca Turini, Riccardo Riolo, Marco Polini, Marco Schiró, Frank H.L. Koppens</p>
            <p>The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.</p>

            <h2>Catalytic activity of Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high entropy alloy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yogesh Kumar Yadav, Mohammad Abu Shaz, Thakur Prasad Yadav</p>
            <p>Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising material for hydrogen storage because of its abundance and beneficial properties, such as high storage capacity and cost-effectiveness under mild conditions. Despite of these benefits, MgH2 unfavorable thermodynamics and kinetics make it difficult to use in real applications. In this work, the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2have been improved using Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high entropy alloy (HEA) based catalysts, which has been synthesized via mechanical alloying. The experimental findings show that the beginning desorption temperature of MgH2significantly lowered from 425°C to 180°C by adding 5 wt. % Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA in MgH2. Moreover, the catalyst shows enhanced kinetics, attaining 7.3 wt. % hydrogen absorption in 3 minutes at 320°C with 15 atm hydrogen pressure, and ~5 wt. % desorption in 6 minutes at 320°C. These results highlight, how much lower its desorption temperature is than those of other well-known catalysts. Over a span of 25 cycles, MgH2 catalyzed by Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA exhibits remarkable cyclic stability with negligible fluctuations (~ 0.05 wt. %).After a thorough characterization of the materials, a workable catalytic mechanism for HEA was proposed in light of the results.</p>

            <h2>Single-Atom Catalysis: An Opportunity For Surface Science</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gareth S. Parkinson</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, extensive research into single-atom catalysts (SACs) has revealed that the catalytic behavior of metal adatoms is highly dependent on how they interact with their support. A strong dependence on the local coordination environment has led to comparisons with metal-organic complexes, and there is growing excitement about the potential to fine-tune SACs by controlling the adsorption geometry. The rise of computational screening to identify the optimal support-metal combinations underscores the need for rigorous benchmarking of theoretical methods, to validate realistic geometries, mechanisms, and the impact of adsorption on stability and catalytic activity. The surface science approach is particularly well-suited for this task because it allows to precisely determine the geometry of the metal atom and interpret its catalytic behavior. Moreover, the effects of temperature and molecular adsorption on the model catalysts stability can be studied in isolation, and conclusions drawn from UHV studies tested in increasingly common near-ambient pressure and electrochemical setups. This perspective highlights recent breakthroughs and specific systems, including metal oxides, metal-organic frameworks, and carbon nitrides, where insights from surface science experiments can significantly advance understanding in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

            <h2>Eliminating the confined dark-exciton qubit precession using an externally applied magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zu-En Su, Dan Cogan, Ido Schwartz, Ayal Beck, David Gershoni</p>
            <p>We investigate experimentally and theoretically the behavior of the confined dark exciton in an InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dot, under the application of an external magnetic field in Voigt configuration. We show that by varying the magnitude and direction of the external field one can accurately control the dark-exciton fine-structure splitting. In addition, we show that the dark-exciton spin state is approximately polarized along the cubic crystallographic directions [100] or equivalents. By comparing our experimental results with a model for the exchange and Zeeman interactions, we find the conditions for nullifying the fine-structure splitting between the two eigenstates of the dark exciton, thereby stopping its qubit precession.</p>

            <h2>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyao Huang, Xinfang Zhang, Xiaofeng Yi, Jibang Fu, Weichen Wang, Mingtang Deng</p>
            <p>Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Coexistence of $p$-wave Magnetism and Superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavlo Sukhachov, Hans Gløckner Giil, Bjørnulf Brekke, Jacob Linder</p>
            <p>The symmetry requirements for realizing unconventional compensated magnets with spin-polarized bands such as altermagnets have recently been uncovered. The most recent addition to this family of magnets is parity-odd or $p$-wave magnets. We demonstrate that $p$-wave magnets are perfectly compatible with superconductivity due to the spin polarization of their electron bands and that they induce unexpected spin transport phenomena. We first show that $p$-wave magnetism can coexist with conventional superconductivity regardless of the magnitude of the spin splitting. We then predict that $p$-wave magnets induce a charge-to-spin conversion, which can be strongly enhanced by the presence of superconductivity providing a way to probe the coexistence in experiments. Our results open a new avenue for material combinations with a synergetic relation between spintronics and superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</p>

            <p>Generative models generate vast numbers of hypothetical materials, necessitating fast, accurate models for property prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in this domain but face challenges like high training costs, domain adaptation issues, and over-smoothing.

DenseGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets such as JARVIS-DFT, Materials Project, and QM9, improving the performance of models like GIN, Schnet, and Hamnet on materials datasets. By optimizing atomic embeddings and reducing computational costs, DenseGNN enables deeper architectures and surpasses other GNNs in crystal structure distinction, approaching X-ray diffraction method accuracy.

            <p>Pressure serves as a fundamental tuning parameter capable of drastically modifying all properties of matter. The advent of diamond anvil cells (DACs) has enabled a compact and tabletop platform for generating extreme pressure conditions in laboratory settings. However, the limited spatial dimensions and ultrahigh pressures within these environments present significant challenges for conventional spectroscopy techniques. In this work, we integrate optical spin defects within a thin layer of two-dimensional (2D) materials directly into the high-pressure chamber, enabling an in situ quantum sensing platform for mapping local stress and magnetic environments up to 4~GPa. Compared to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers embedded in diamond anvils, our 2D sensors exhibit around three times stronger response to local stress and provide nanoscale proximity to the target sample in heterogeneous devices. We showcase the versatility of our approach by imaging both stress gradients within the high-pressure chamber and a pressure-driven magnetic phase transition in a room-temperature self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$. Our work demonstrates an integrated quantum sensing device for high-pressure experiments, offering potential applications in probing pressure-induced phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and mechanical deformation.</p>

            <p>We present an effective ab initio method to calculate the crystal field coefficients of an erbium (Er3+) ion experiencing different local site symmetries in several wide-band-gap oxides, and then evaluate crystal field splittings of these Er3+ ions for their ground and excited states. The optical transitions between the ground state (Z) and excited state (Y) manifolds of the environmentally shielded 4f states of these Er3+ ions have wavelengths ~1.5 microns and thus have potential applications to quantum communications and quantum memories. These results are in excellent agreement with recent low-temperature measurements, provided the inadequate calculation of the 4f shell screening is adjusted by reducing the radial extent of the 4f wavefunctions by approximately a factor of 2.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yogendra Limbu, Yueguang Shi, Joseph Sink, Tharnier O. Puel, Durga Paudyal, Michael E. Flatté</p>
            <p>We expand here our description of a newly developed simple and effective ab initio method of calculating crystal field coefficients (CFCs) of rare-earth atoms in insulating hosts, focusing on Er in wide band gap oxide hosts MgO, ZnO, TiO$_2$, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$, which exemplify different local site symmetries. These hybrid functional calculations, which incorporate a portion of exact exchange from Hartree-Fock theory, reproduce the experimentally identified insulating band gaps of these oxides. The negative values of cohesive and formation energies confirm the structural and chemical stability of these oxides, whereas the defect formation energies indicate that Er doped ZnO, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$ are easier to form compared to Er doped MgO and TiO$_2$. Er doped in these oxide hosts exhibits a spin magnetic moment of $\sim$ 3 $\mu_B$ confirming the $3+$ valence state. The CFCs of these hosted Er are determined from charge densities and potentials obtained from non-spin-polarized calculations, involving a 4\textit{f} core approximation. These CFCs are subsequently used to solve an effective Hamiltonian and generate the crystal field splitting of Er 4f. These calculated Er 4f energy levels are in good agreement with available experiments.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic properties of Cr$_8$ and V$_8$ molecular rings from ab initio calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elia Stocco, Maria Barbara Maccioni, Andrea Floris, Matteo Cococcioni</p>
            <p>Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulations of defects near the (0001) surface of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijaya Begum-Hudde, Yi-Ting Lee, Barbara A. Jones, André Schleife</p>
            <p>Defects in materials are ubiquitous and one of their adverse effects in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ is the initiation of corrosion. While this process starts near the surface, the defects involved and their electronic structure need to be elucidated with high accuracy. Since point defects are confined to a small spatial region, defect embedding theory allows the definition of an active space, comprising of the defect electronic states, that is coupled to the environment of the host material. The active space Hamiltonian is of small rank, enabling access to its electronic properties using a high-level or even exact quantum theory. In this paper we use these techniques and first-principles simulations to compute the structural and electronic properties of near-surface vacancies for the (0001) surface of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$, and investigate the influence of defects and hydration on the initiation and propagation of corrosion. We report the defect electronic structure for strongly localized ground and excited states of the surface O vacancy and compare results obtained using full configuration interaction and a variational quantum eigensolver on a quantum computer. Error mitigation techniques are explored and shown to reduce the error due to the hardware noise to the point where the quantum result agrees with the exact solution within chemical accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Zero Field Antiferromagnetically Coupled Skyrmions and their Field-Driven Uncoupling in Composite Chiral Multilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> May Inn Sim, Dickson Thian, Ramu Maddu, Xiaoye Chen, Hang Khume Tan, Chao Li, Pin Ho, Anjan Soumyanarayanan</p>
            <p>Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions are topological spin structures with fully compensated, net-zero magnetization. Compared to their ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion counterparts, their reduced stray field and enhanced electrical response can enable linear, high-throughput current-driven motion. However, their bubble-like character in conventional bilayer AFs limits their stability to fluctuations, leading to deformation and annihilation. Here we present the engineering of a composite AF chiral multilayer, wherein the interplay of AF and FM interlayer couplings generates compensated skyrmions with compact structures. High-resolution magnetic imaging and micromagnetic simulations show that the internal exchange field stabilizes AF skyrmions at zero external field with characteristics comparable to FM counterparts at 100 mT. Quantitative analyses establish their decoupling above the exchange field, yielding independent, spatially segregated textures in constituent chiral layers. This work provides a foundation to develop AF spin-textures with enhanced immunity, compatible with efficient readout and manipulation, with relevance to unconventional computing.</p>

            <p>Pressure is a powerful thermodynamic parameter for tuning the magnetic properties of van der Waals magnets owing to their weak interlayer bonding. However, local magnetometry measurements under high pressure still remain elusive for this important class of emerging materials. Here we introduce a method enabling in situ magnetic imaging of van der Waals magnets under high pressure with sub-micron spatial resolution. Our approach relies on a quantum sensing platform based on boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which can be placed in atomic contact of any type of two-dimensional (2D) material within a van der Waals heterostructure. We first show that the V$_\text{B}^-$ center can be used as a magnetic field sensor up to pressures of a few GPa, a pressure range for which the properties of a wide variety of van der Waals magnets are efficiently altered. We then use V$_\text{B}^-$ centers in a thin hBN layer to perform magnetic imaging of a van der Waals magnet under pressure. As a proof of concept, we study the pressure-dependent magnetization in micrometer-sized flakes of $1T$-CrTe$_2$, whose evolution is explained by a shift of the Curie temperature. Besides providing a new path for studying pressure-induced phase transitions in van der Waals magnets, this work also opens up interesting perspectives for exploring the physics of 2D superconductors under pressure via local measurements of the Meissner effect.</p>

            <h2>The signature of topology in polar and chiral non-magnetic crystal classes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giancarlo Soavi, Jan Wilhelm</p>
            <p>Topology is fundamental to condensed matter physics, underlying phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in its various forms, protected surface states and spin-valley locking. Central to this is the Berry curvature, a measure of the geometric properties of Bloch wavefunctions in crystals. Despite its established connections to space inversion and time-reversal symmetries, a comprehensive framework linking the Berry curvature to other crystal symmetries is still missing. Here, we present a theoretical model for the Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature in the proximity of optical resonances for all non-magnetic crystal classes. The Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature is readily derived from the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of the time-invariant point groups. We show that the diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix, which define the divergence of the Berry curvature, are non-zero only for the chiral crystal classes, pointing towards a topological origin of circular dichroism. In polar crystals, we uniquely find a non-zero curl of the Berry curvature, suggesting a topological origin of spontaneous polarization via the Maxwell-Berry equations. Our findings thus open new perspectives for the topological interpretation of textbook phenomena at the heart of condensed matter physics.</p>

            <h2>Single-molecule Scale Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy using Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiangfeng Du, Fazhan Shi, Xi Kong, Fedor Jekezko, Jörg Wrachtrup</p>
            <p>Single-molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single-molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single-molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. Particularly, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance, encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods. This detailed analysis serves as a foundation for the development of new technologies and the exploration of potential applications.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolishing readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.</p>

            <p>Unravelling the mechanism behind bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in amorphous rare earth-transition metal films has proven challenging. This is largely due to the inherent complexity of amorphous structure and the entangled potential origins arising from microstructure and atomic structure factors. Here, we present an approach wherein the magneto-electric effect is harnessed to induce 90° switching of bulk PMA in Tb-Co films to in-plane directions by applying voltages of only -1.2 V. This manipulation is achieved by voltage-driven insertion of hydrogen atoms into interstitial sites between Tb and Co atoms, which serves as a perturbation to local atomic structure. Using angle-dependent X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, we find that the anisotropy switching originates from the distortion of crystal field around Tb which reorients the alignment of Tb orbital moments. Initially aligned along Tb-Co bonding directions, the easy magnetization axis undergoes reorientation and switches by 90°, as substantiated by ab-initio calculations. Our study not only concludes the atomic origin of Tb-Co atom bonding configuration in shaping bulk PMA, but also establishes the groundwork for electrically programmable ferrimagnetic spintronics, such as controlling domain wall motion and programming artificial spin textures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingyuan Cui, Kai-Xuan Zhang, Je-Geun Park</p>
            <p>Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the electrical transport properties of a magnetic kagome metal EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$, which undergoes magnetic ordering below $T_\mathrm{c}=10.5$ K. Unlike typical magnets showing anomalous magnetotransport in their ordered states, EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ exhibits unusual magnetotransport behaviors in its paramagnetic phase. Specifically, the magnetoconductivity shows a linear dependence on magnetic field at low fields below $\sim 1$ T, and the Hall conductivity undergoes a sign change below about 2 T. These behaviors resemble those observed in the charge density wave (CDW) phase of kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs). The anomalous magnetotransport in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ has commonly been attributed to the possible emergence of a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral CDW order. However, given the absence of CDW in EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and its manifestation exclusively in the paramagnetic state, the anomalous magnetotransport observed in EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ is likely associated with multiband transport and/or the van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.</p>

            <h2>Violation of Ferromagnetic Ordering of Energy Levels in Spin Rings for the Singlet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Heson, Shannon Starr, Jacob Thornton</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a violation of the ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels'' conjecture (FOEL) for even length spin rings. The FOEL conjecture was a guess made by Nachtergaele, Spitzer and an author for the Heisenberg model on certain graphs: a family of inequalities, the first of which is the statement that the spectral gap of the Heisenberg model equals the gap of the random walk. That first guess was originally a conjecture of Aldous which was later proved by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer. We claim that for spin rings of even length $L>4$, the lowest spin $S=0$ energy is lower than the lowest spin $S=1$ energy. This violates the $(L/2)$-th inequality in the FOEL conjecture. Our methodology is largely numerical: we have applied exact diagonalization up to $L=20$. We also rigorously consider the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg spin ring for even length $L$ projected to the spin $S=0$ sector. We prove that it has a unique ground state. Then, using the single mode approximation the uniqueness explains the energy turn-around. Important insight comes from reconsideration of previous work by Sutherland, using the Bethe ansatz. Especially important is a work of Dhar and Shastry that goes beyond the Bethe ansatz.</p>

            <p>The vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons offers numerous possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale. The development of twistoptics - the modulation of the optical properties by twisting stacks of vdW materials - enables directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, known as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of directional propagation of polaritons by reporting the visualization of unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). They arise naturally in twisted hyperbolic stacks with very different thicknesses of their constituents, demonstrated for homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Importantly, their ray-like propagation, characterized by large momenta and constant phase, is tunable by both the twist angle and the illumination frequency. Apart from their fundamental importance, our findings introduce twisted asymmetric stacks as efficient platforms for nanoscale directional polariton propagation, opening the door for applications in nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.</p>

            <p>Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</p>

            <h2>Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muneki Yasuda, Ryosuke Maeno, Chako Takahashi</p>
            <p>In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.</p>

            <p>III-nitride heterostructures are critical for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications, however red emission remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge by systematically exploring their design space with machine learning. We surprisingly uncover that larger polarization fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. We outline strategies for engineering polarization fields through the tuning of composition, strain, and interlayer and quantum-barrier thicknesses. Without polarization fields, efficient red emission would not be possible in nitride LEDs given the current challenges in nitride epitaxy. Our results show how polarization can improve light emission from polar semiconductor heterostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takahiro Orito, Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as Rényi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</p>

            <p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.</p>

Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</p>

            <p>Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.</p>

This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Phonon-Phonon Interactions and Weakened Electron-Phonon Coupling in Charge-Density-Wave Topological Semimetal EuAl4 with a Possible Intermediate Electronic State</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shize Cao, Feng Jin, Yun-Ze Long, Jianlin Luo, Qingming Zhang, Zhi-Guo Chen</p>
            <p>The origin of charge density wave (CDW) is a long-term open issue. Furthermore, the evolution of phonon-phonon interactions (PPI) across CDW transitions has rarely been investigated. Besides, whether electron-phonon coupling (EPC) would be weakened or enhanced after CDW transitions is still under debate. Additionally, CDW provides a fertile ground for uncovering intriguing intermediate electronic states. Here, we report a Raman spectroscopy study of the PPI and EPC in topological semimetal EuAl4 exhibiting a CDW phase below temperature Tc ~ 145 K. The free-charge-carrier-density (nc) and temperature dependences of the Fano asymmetric factors (1/|q|) of the two phonon modes A1g and B1g indicates that below Tc, the EPC becomes weakened probably due to the reduction of the nc. Interestingly, in the temperature range from 50 to 145 K, the steep growth of the 1/|q| leading to the significant deviation from the linear dependence on the nc, together with the shoulder-like features in the temperature evolutions of the 1/|q| and the nc around 50 K, implies the possible existence of an intermediate electronic state with the EPC distinctly larger than the CDW ground state in EuAl4. Furthermore, below Tc, the faster decrease in the full width at half maxima of the B1g phonon mode representing the collective vibrations of the CDW-modulated Al1 atoms suggests that a remarkable growth of the PPI for the B1g phonon mode after the CDW phase transition, which is in contrast to the weakening of the EPC and thus may mainly arise from the strengthening of lattice anharmonicity in EuAl4. Our results not only highlight the significance of the enhanced PPI and the weakened EPC in completely understanding the formation of the CDW phase but also initiate the exploration of novel intermediate electronic states in EuAl4.</p>

            <p>CeRh2As2 is a newly discovered candidate of multiphase heavy-fermion superconductor (Tc=0.3 K) with intriguing physical properties. Here, we employ soft point-contact spectroscopy to investigate its energy gap behaviors in both the normal and superconducting states. The differential conductance below Tc reveals an estimated superconducting energy gap of 2{\Delta}SC=0.24 meV and thus an extremely strong superconducting pairing strength 2{\Delta}SC/kBTc=8.8, which is comparable to those of cuprates and iron-based high-Tc superconductors as well as infinite-layer nickelates. Above Tc, a well-defined pseudogap feature is manifested as a V-shaped dip in the differential conductance spanning an energy scale of 2{\Delta}g=0.95-3.0 meV. The pseudogap feature persists to the highest characteristic temperature of Tg=8-9 K and is gradually suppressed by magnetic field of Bg=9.0T regardless of its direction relative to the crystallographic axes. The observation of pseudogap features prior to the superconducting phase transition enriches the phase diagram of CeRh2As2 and provides a novel platform to study the interplay of unconventional superconductivity and pseudogap phenomena.</p>

In this study, we report here on a successful growth by molecular beam epitaxy of high crystalline quality Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se:Bi/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs with $x = 0.25$ and $y = 0.1$, and on their magnetotransport characterization as a function of the QW thickness between 10 and 50 nm, temperatures down to 300 mK, perpendicular and tilted magnetic fields up to 36 T. The character of weak antilocalization magnetoresistance and universal conductance fluctuations points to a notably long phase coherence length. It is argued that a relatively large magnitude of the dielectric constant of IV-VI compounds suppresses the decoherence by electron-electron scattering. The observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations and the quantum Hall effect, together with multiband $k\cdot p$ modelling, have enabled us to assess valley degeneracies, the magnitude of strain, subbands effective masses, the Berry phases, and the topological phase diagram as a function of the QW thickness. Our results demonstrate that further progress in controlling Sn content, carrier densities, and magnetism in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs will allow for the exploration of the topologically protected quantized edge transport even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, a reduced strength of electron-electron interactions will result in the absence of unpaired localized spins in the topological gap and, thus, in a substantially longer topological protection length compared to the quantum spin Hall materials explored so far.</p>

            <p>Chirality, a pervasive phenomenon in nature, is widely studied across diverse fields including the origins of life, chemical catalysis, drug discovery, and physical optoelectronics. The investigations of natural chiral materials have been constrained by their intrinsically weak chiral effects. Recently, significant progress has been made in the fabrication and assembly of low-dimensional micro and nanoscale chiral materials and their architectures, leading to the discovery of novel optoelectronic phenomena such as circularly polarized light emission, spin and charge flip, advocating great potential for applications in quantum information, quantum computing, and biosensing. Despite these advancements, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the generation, propagation, and amplification of chirality in low-dimensional chiral materials and architectures remain largely unexplored. To tackle these challenges, we focus on employing ultrafast spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of chirality evolution, with the aim of attaining a more profound understanding of the microscopic mechanisms governing chirality generation and amplification. This review thus provides a comprehensive overview of the chiral micro-/nano-materials, including two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), chiral halide perovskites, and chiral metasurfaces, with a particular emphasis on the physical mechanism. This review further explores the advancements made by ultrafast chiral spectroscopy research, thereby paving the way for innovative devices in chiral photonics and optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>The diversity of 2D materials and their van der Waals (vdW) stacking presents a fertile ground for engineering novel multifunctional materials and quantum states of matter. This permits unique opportunities to tailor the electronic properties of vdW heterostructures by the insertion of only a single 2D material layer. However, such vdW materials engineering at the atomic scale has yet to be investigated for spin-charge interconversion phenomena. Here, we report on the control of these effects at the monolayer level, where drastic increase in intensity and change in sign of THz spintronic emission are demonstrated by inserting a single layer of MoSe$_2$ between PtSe$_2$ and graphene in a fully epitaxial, large area stacked structure. By using a combination of spin and angle resolved photoemission and density functional theory to reveal the electronic and spin structures, we illustrate two different mechanisms relying on charge transfer and electronic hybridization for the formation of Rashba states, which are responsible for spin-charge conversion and hence the THz spintronic emission. These findings open new pathways to design, at the atomic scale, efficient THz spintronic emitters made of 2D materials and other spintronic devices based on spin-charge interconversion phenomena.</p>

            <p>In doped transition metal dichalcogenides, optically created excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) can strongly interact with a Fermi sea of electrons to form Fermi polaron quasiparticles. When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.</p>

            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</p>

            <p>Since the discovery of high-entropy superconductors in 2014, superconductivity has remained a focal point of interest in medium- and high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs). Here, we report a series of (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors crystallized in the BCC structure, whose superconductivity was characterized by resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The study found that the (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEAs exhibit bulk superconductivity. With the doping of Nb, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases from 5.31 K to 9.11 K, and the normalized Cel jumps at Tc, and the logarithmically averaged characteristic phonon frequency exhibit dome-shaped curves. Results from specific heat measurements indicate that the superconductivity is of a strongly coupled s-wave type observed. Furthermore, at low Nb content, the upper critical field of the samples is larger than the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The strongly coupling behavior and large upper critical field in s-wave type (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors are unusual, as they typically occur in other unconventional superconductors. Thus, (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx may have significant potential in the research and understanding of physical mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in magnetic topological insulators induces a Dirac gap in the topological surface state (TSS), leading to exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Yet, the interplay between TRSB and topology in superconductors remains underexplored due to limited suitable materials. Here we employ zero-field muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) as a sensitive probe of TRSB to map out the electronic phase diagrams of iron-chalcogenide superconductors FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. For the Te composition $x=0.64$ with the highest superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}=14.5$ K, which is known to host a TSS and Majorana zero modes within vortices, we detect spontaneous magnetic fields below $T_{\rm c}$ distinct from a magnetic order. This signifies a TRSB superconducting state in the bulk, revealing the convergence of unconventional TRSB superconductivity with topologically nontrivial electronic structures in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. Given the relatively high $T_{\rm c}$ and the tunability of the Fermi level through chemical substitution, iron-chalcogenide superconductors offer an intriguing platform for investigating the synergy between topological superconductivity and TRSB.</p>

            <p>Misfit-layered compounds, naturally occurring bulk heterostructures, present a compelling alternative to artificially engineered ones, offering a unique platform for exploring correlated phases and quantum phenomena. This study investigates the magnetotransport and superconducting properties of the misfit compound (PbS)$_{1.13}$TaS$_2$, comprising alternating PbS and 1$H$-TaS$_2$ layers. It exhibits distinctive transport properties, including a prominent planar Hall effect and a four-fold oscillatory Butterfly-shaped anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). Moreover, it shows multigap two-dimensional superconductivity with an exceptionally high in-plane upper critical field, exceeding the Pauli limit. The coexistence of unconventional superconductivity and anomalous transport - two distinct quantum phenomena, within the same material, suggests that misfit compounds provide an ideal platform for realizing quantum effects in the two-dimensional limit of bulk crystals. This opens the door to the development of simpler and more efficient quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Ensemble-averaged mean-field many-body level density: an indicator of integrable versus chaotic single-particle dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georg Maier, Carolyn Echter, Juan Diego Urbina, Caio Lewenkopf, Klaus Richter</p>
            <p>According to the quantum chaos paradigm, the nature of a system's classical dynamics, whether integrable or chaotic, is universally reflected in the fluctuations of its quantum spectrum. However, since many-body spectra in the mean field limit are composed of independent single-particle energy levels, their spectral fluctuations always display Poissonian behavior and hence cannot be used to distinguish underlying chaotic from integrable single-particle dynamics. We demonstrate that this distinction can, instead, be revealed from the mean many-body level density (at fixed energy) and its variance after averaging over ensembles representing different types of single-particle dynamics. This is in strong contrast to the energy-averaged mean level density (of a given system) that is assumed not to carry such information and is routinely removed to focus on universal signatures. To support our claim we systematically analyze the role of single-particle level correlations, that enter through Poisson and random matrix statistics (of various symmetry classes) into the ensemble-averaged density of states and its variance, contrasting bosonic and fermionic many-body systems. Our analytical study, together with extensive numerical simulations for systems with $N \ge 5$ particles consistently reveal significant differences (up to an order of magnitude for fermions and even larger for bosons) in the mean many-body level densities, depending on the nature of the underlying dynamics. Notably, in the fermionic case Poisson-type single-particle level fluctuations precisely cancel contributions from indistinguishability, such that the average many-body spectral density equals the (Thomas-Fermi) volume term. We further highlight the difference between the mean level density and its variance as functions of the total energy $E$ and the excitation energy $Q$.</p>

            <p>High-energy bursts in superconducting quantum circuits from various radiation sources have recently become a practical concern due to induced errors and their propagation in the chip. The speed and distance of these disturbances have practical implications. We used a linear array of multiplexed MKIDs on a single silicon chip to measure the propagation velocity of a localized high-energy burst, introduced by driving a Normal metal- Insulator-Superconductor (NIS) junction. We observed a reduction in the apparent propagation velocity with NIS power, which is due to the combined effect of reduced phonon flux with distance and the existence of a minimum detectable QP density in the MKIDs. A simple theoretical model is fitted to extract the longitudinal phonon velocity in the substrate and the conversion efficiency of phonons to QPs in the superconductor.</p>

            <p>Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.</p>

            <p>Electrocatalytic processes occurring at the heterogeneous interface are complex and their understanding at the molecular level remains challenging. Atomic force microscope (AFM) can detect force interactions down to the atomic level, but so far it has been mainly used to obtain in-situ images of electrocatalysts. Here for the first time, we employ AFM to investigate gas evolution at a platinum ultramicroelectrode (Pt UME) under electrochemical conditions using the force noise method. We detect excess force noise when the individual H2 gas bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment events occur at the Pt UME. The excess noise varies linearly with the applied potential on a semi-log plot. Chronoamperometry current fluctuations indicate that the H2 gas bubble radius increases from 1 to 10 micrometers and the AFM deflection signal measurements indicate that the mean H2 bubble radius is 321 micrometers. These two values point to the coalescence of small bubbles generated at the Pt UME interface. The contribution reports an innovative method to probe the gas bubble dynamics at the heterogenous interface under electrochemical conditions with high sensitivity.</p>

            <p>Advancement of solid state electrolytes (SSEs) for all solid state batteries typically focuses on modification of a parent structural framework for improved conductivity, \textit{e.g.} cation substitution for an immobile ion or varying the concentration of the mobile ion. Therefore, novel frameworks can be disruptive by enabling fast ion conduction aided by different structure and diffusion mechanisms, and unlocking optimal conductors with different properties (\textit{e.g.} mechanical properties, sintering needs, electrochemical stability) than previously published. Herein, we perform a high throughput survey of an understudied structural framework for sodium ion conduction, Na$_{8-x}$A$^x$P$_2$O$_9$ (NAP), to understand the family's thermodynamic stability, synthesizability, and ionic conduction. We first show that the parent phase Na$_4$TiP$_2$O$_9$ (NTP) undergoes a structural distortion (with accompanying conductivity transition) due to unstable phonons from a pseduo-Jahn Teller mode in the 1D titanium chains. Then, screening of cation-substituted structural candidates with \textit{ab initio} and machine-learned potential calculations reveal a number of candidates that are thermodynamically stable, likely synthesizable, and have high predicted ionic conductivities. High throughput experimental trials and subsequent methodology optimization of one Na$_4$SnP$_2$O$_9$ (NSP) highlight collective challenges to the synthesis pathways for sodium phosphate materials via solid state synthesis. Our results demonstrate that NAP is a highly tunable conduction framework whose high temperature conductivity transition has heretofore eliminated it from significant research interest. By expanding the structural toolkit for SSE design, we increase the number of useful sodium ion electrolytes for integration into safe and accessible solid state batteries.</p>

            <p>The demand for efficient data processing motivates a shift toward in-memory computing architectures. Ferroelectric materials, particularly AlScN, show great promise for next-generation memory devices. However, their widespread application is limited due challenges such as high coercive fields, leakage currents and limited stability. Our work introduces a novel synthesis approach for ferroelectric AlScN thin films using high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). Through a combinatorial study, we investigate the effect of scandium content and substrate bias on the ferroelectric properties of AlScN films deposited using metal-ion synchronized (MIS) HiPIMS. Leveraging the high ionization rates of HiPIMS and optimally timed substrate bias potentials, we enhance the adatom mobility at low temperatures. Our films exhibit a high degree of texture and crystallinity as well as low roughness at temperatures as low as 250°C. Most importantly, the films exhibit coercive fields comparable to state-of-the-art values (5 MV/cm) with significantly enhanced remanent polarization (158-172.0 {\mu}C/cm2). Notably, the remanent polarization remains stable across varying scandium concentrations. We further evaluate cycling stability and leakage current to assess suitability for memory applications. This study demonstrates HiPIMS as a scalable and CMOS compatible technique for synthesizing high-quality ferroelectric AlScN films, paving the way for their application in non-volatile memory applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Li, Jitai Yang, Yu Zhai, Hui Li</p>
            <p>Lithium and sodium solid electrolytes feature polyanion frameworks and highly mobile cations. Understanding and quantifying the impact of polyanion dynamics on cations will help us to unravel the complex role that anion play in superionic conductors. However, no experimental or computational method can directly extract this information, as polyanion dynamics are always coupled with other factors that affect ion mobility. Here, we present the pioneering study that combines constraint algorithm and machine-learning molecular dynamics to quantitatively reveal the effects of polyanion translation, rotation, and vibration on cation mobility across a diverse material class. Ultralong-time, large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations with selective constraints on each anion motion mode unequivocally yield results at near room and elevated temperatures. In sharp contrast to the previous understanding that facile anion rotation primarily facilitates cation transport, the strong coupling between anion translation and vibration with cation diffusion has been unraveled for the first time; we find that translation, rotation, and vibration can each directly drive superionicity, with one typically dominant in each class of materials. Anion rotation dominates cation transport when the rotation frequency matches the cation hopping frequency, whereas anion translation prevails at higher and vibration at lower rotation frequencies. The impact of anion dynamics on cation diffusion becomes more prominent at lower temperatures.</p>

            <p>The long-standing question of why foaming is easier in seawater than in freshwater remains unresolved. In this study, we address this issue through precise interferometry single bubble experiments, demonstrating that the theory proposed by G. Marrucci (1969) provides a compelling explanation. Electrolyte solutions with varying concentrations of phosphate salts were used to study film formation and drainage, with thickness tracked by interferometry. In deionized water, bubbles rupture within seconds due to repaid dimple collapse. However, in phosphate salt solutions, bubbles persisted for several minutes. While surface tension gradients from evaporation-driven salt concentration gradients have been thought to create Marangoni stresses, our results show that despite film thinning being capillary-dominated, Marangoni-driven influx can be observed. Marrucci's theory explains this by showing that an increased interfacial area as the film thins, leads to higher salt concentration in the film due to Gibbs surface excess. This concentration gradient induces Marangoni stresses, causing flow reversal, increased film thickness, and enhanced foam stability. We show that Marrucci's theory has been incorrectly dismissed, and the predicted critical heights where fluid influx occurs closely match our findings and other studies using sodium chloride. Additionally, we extend the theory's applicability to foam films in non-aqueous film mixtures, highlighting its broader relevance.</p>

            <p>Ring polymer self-consistent field theory is used to calculate the critical temperatures and heat capacities of an ideal Bose gas for an order of magnitude more particles than previously reported. A lambda-transition indicative of Bose-Einstein condensation is observed as expected. Using a known proof of spatial mode entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates, a relationship between boson exchange and quantum entanglement is established. This is done without the use of state vectors, since ring polymer quantum theory uses instead a thermal degree of freedom, sometimes called the "imaginary time", to map classical statistical mechanics onto non-relativistic quantum mechanics through the theorems of density functional theory. It is shown that quantum phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, boson exchange, entanglement and contextuality, can be visualized in terms of merging and separating ring polymer threads in thermal-space. A possible extension to fermions is mentioned.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Sappington, Vaibhav Mohanty</p>
            <p>Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator and axion state in V2WS4</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yadong Jiang, Huan Wang, Kejie Bao, Jing Wang</p>
            <p>Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators offers an ideal platform to explore exotic topological phenomena, such as axion electrodynamics, quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect and Majorana edge modes. However, these emerging new physical effects have rarely been experimentally observed due to the limited choice of suitable materials. Here, we predict the van der Waals layered V$_2$WS$_4$ and its related materials show intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. We find extremely rich magnetic topological states in V$_2$WS$_4$, including an antiferromagnetic topological insulator, the axion state with the long-sought quantized topological magnetoelectric effect, three-dimensional QAH state, as well as a collection of QAH insulators and intrinsic axion insulators in odd- and even-layer films, respectively. Remarkably, the Néel temperature of V$_2$WS$_4$ is predicted to be much higher than that of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. These interesting predictions, if realized experimentally, could greatly promote the topological quantum physics research and application.</p>

            <h2>Probing Fermi surface parity with spin resolved transverse magnetic focussing</h2>

            <p>Measurements of the Fermi surface are a fundamental technique for determining the electrical and magnetic properties of solids. In 2D systems, the area and diameter of the Fermi surface is typically measured using Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and commensurability oscillations respectively. However, these techniques are unable to detect changes in the parity of the Fermi surface (i.e. when +k $\neq$ -k). Here, we show that transverse magnetic focussing can be used to detect such changes, because focussing only measures a well defined section of the Fermi surface and does not average over +k and -k. Furthermore, our results show that focussing is an order of magnitude more sensitive to changes in the Fermi surface than other 2D techniques, and could be used to investigate similar Fermi surface changes in other 2D systems.</p>

            <h2>Restart uncertainty relation for monitored quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruoyu Yin, Qingyuan Wang, Sabine Tornow, Eli Barkai</p>
            <p>We introduce a novel time-energy uncertainty relation within the context of restarts in monitored quantum dynamics. Initially, we investigate the concept of ``first hitting time'' in quantum systems using an IBM quantum computer and a three-site ring graph as our starting point. Previous studies have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances. Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time. This work not only contributes to our understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua Wang, Hong-Yi Xie, Kieran Mullen</p>
            <p>We propose harnessing the tools of modern nano-fabrication to provide electrical control of exciton-polariton (EP) condensates. We develop the theory of a device based on the Josephson effect in which electric fields can be used to both switch between and monitor various dynamical modes. In particular, both the bias potential and the Josephson energy can be tuned electrically via the exciton component. We model the device by a Gross-Pitaevskii equation assuming that ideal EP condensates are established with well-balanced pumping and dissipation. We find that the EP condensates can be manipulated through degrees of freedom not easily accessible in other coherent quantum systems, and the dynamics of EP Josephson junctions are richer than that of the conventional superconducting junctions. The ability to control and monitor the condensate by both optical and electrical means allows new ways to study its physics not possible by either, alone.</p>

            <h2>The statistical mechanics and machine learning of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Jreissaty, Juan Carrasquilla</p>
            <p>We study the statistical physics of the classical Ising model in the so-called $\alpha$-Rényi ensemble, a finite-temperature thermal state approximation that minimizes a modified free energy based on the $\alpha$-Rényi entropy. We begin by characterizing its critical behavior in mean-field theory in different regimes of the Rényi index $\alpha$. Next, we re-introduce correlations and consider the model in one and two dimensions, presenting analytical arguments for the former and devising a Monte Carlo approach to the study of the latter. Remarkably, we find that while mean-field predicts a continuous phase transition below a threshold index value of $\alpha \sim 1.303$ and a first-order transition above it, the Monte Carlo results in two dimensions point to a continuous transition at all $\alpha$. We conclude by performing a variational minimization of the $\alpha$-Rényi free energy using a recurrent neural network (RNN) ansatz where we find that the RNN performs well in two dimensions when compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Our work highlights the potential opportunities and limitations associated with the use of the $\alpha$-Rényi ensemble formalism in probing the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of classical and quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Binary compound FeGe hosts multiple structures, from cubic and hexagonal to monoclinic. Compared to the well-known skyrmion lattice in the cubic phase and the antiferromagnetic charge-density wave in the hexagonal phase, the monoclinic FeGe is less explored. Here, we synthesized the monoclinic FeGe films on Al2O3 (001) and studied their structural, magnetic, and transport properties. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterizations indicate that the FeGe films are epitaxial to the substrate. Unlike the antiferromagnetic bulk, the monoclinic FeGe films are ferromagnetic with Curie-temperature as high as ~ 800 K, contributing to the anomalous Hall effect in the transport measurements. Similar to the hexagonal FeGe, we captured a structural phase transition in the monoclinic FeGe films at ~ 100 K in real and reciprocal spaces by transmission electron microscope. Our work enriches the phase diagram of the FeGe family and suggests that FeGe offers an ideal platform for studying multiphase transitions and related device applications.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Nonlinear Responses in Moving Charge Density Waves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Ming Xie, Hiroki Isobe, Naoto Nagaosa</p>
            <p>The incommensurate charge density wave states (CDWs) can exhibit steady motion in the flow limit after depinning, behaving as a nonequilibrium system with time-dependent states. Since the moving CDW, like an electric current, breaks both time-reversal and inversion symmetries, one may speculate the emergence of nonreciprocal nonlinear responses from such motion. However, the moving CDW order parameter is intrinsically time-dependent in the lab frame, and it is known to be challenging to evaluate the responses of such a time-varying system. In this work, following the principle of Galilean relativity, we resolve this time-dependent hard problem in the lab frame by mapping the system to the comoving frame with static CDW states through the Galilean transformation. We explicitly show that the nonreciprocal nonlinear responses would be generated by the movement of CDW states through violating Galilean relativity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Bergshoeff, Andrea Campoleoni, Giandomenico Palumbo, Patricio Salgado-Rebolledo</p>
            <p>Incompressibility plays a key role in the geometric description of fractional quantum Hall fluids. It is naturally related to quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms and the underlying Girvin-MacDonald-Plazman algebra, which gives rise to an emergent non-relativistic massive spin-2 mode propagating in the bulk. The corresponding metric tensor can be identified with a nematic order parameter for the bulk states. In the linearised regime with a flat background, it has been shown that this mode can be described by a spin-2 Schroedinger action. However, quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms also suggest the existence of higher-spin modes that cannot be described through nematic fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we consider p-atic Hall phases, in which the corresponding p-atic order parameters are related to higher-rank symmetric tensors. We then show that in this framework, non-relativistic massive chiral higher-spin fields naturally emerge and that their dynamics is described by higher-spin Schroedinger actions. We finally show that these effective actions can be derived from relativistic massive higher-spin theories in 2+1 dimensions after taking a non-relativistic limit.</p>

            <p>Chloride molten salts are increasingly used in pyroprocessing techniques for the separation of lanthanides. Understanding thermodynamic properties of these salts is essential to predict their critical characteristics and optimize the separation process. Several thermodynamic models, including the associate model, the two-sublattice ionic model, and the modified quasichemical model with quadruplet approximation (MQMQA), have been utilized in the literature to capture the complexity of molten salts. In the present work, the Bayes factor is used to guide the model selection process for thermodynamic modeling of the KCl-LaCl3 system and provide statistical comparison of various models. The results indicate that the MQMQA model is the most favorable one based on available data. The LiCl-KCl-LaCl3 system has been further modelled with uncertainty quantification (UQ) using MQMQA with the thermodynamic properties of compounds in KCl-LaCl3 predicted by the quasiharmonic approach in terms of first-principles phonon calculations as a function of temperature. The calculated phase stability shows excellent agreement with experimental data, indicating that an appropriate thermodynamic model is important for accurately predicting critical characteristics of complex molten salts.</p>

            <h2>Scaling of contraction costs for entanglement renormalization algorithms including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Barthel, Qiang Miao</p>
            <p>The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions and different optimization strategies, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the optimal number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks through closed-loop, self-driving experimentation, accelerating the optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in self-driving processes with minimal human intervention. This work introduces SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed to execute molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of semiconductor heterostructures through multi-step processes, in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard reactor, parameter initialization, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for multi-step heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. SemiEpi initializes material growth parameters tailored to specific material characteristics, and fine-tuned control over the growth process is then achieved through ML optimization. We optimize the growth for InAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of SemiEpi, achieving a QD density of 5E10/cm2, 1.6-fold increased photoluminescence (PL) intensity and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV. This work highlights the potential of closed-loop, ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step growth. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Furthermore, our strategy facilitates developing a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</p>

            <p>The hydrodynamic interactions among bacterial cell bodies, flagella, and surrounding boundaries are essential for understanding bacterial motility in complex environments. In this study, we demonstrate that each slender flagellum can be modeled as a series of spheres, and that the interactions between these spheres can be accurately characterized using a resistance matrix. This approach allows us to effectively and efficiently evaluate the propulsive effects of the flagella. Notably, our investigation into bacterial motility near a colloidal sphere reveals significant discrepancies between results derived from the twin multipole moment and those obtained through resistive force theory. Consequently, neglecting the hydrodynamic interactions among cell bodies, flagella, and colloidal spheres may lead to substantial inaccuracies. Our model simplifies bacteria into a series of spheres, making it well-suited for examining bacterial motility near spherical boundaries, as well as the nonlinear deformation dynamics of elastic flagella.</p>

            <p>Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transmission properties of a junction between a normal metal and a p-wave magnet in the ballistic regime. We introduce a two-dimensional square lattice that confirms the p-wave magnet criteria. The $\alpha$-vector of the magnet breaks the inversion symmetry of the parabolic dispersion, shifting them in $k$-space. These shifts alter the propagation direction of fermions passing through the junction interface. Depending on spin orientation, the transmission process exhibits anisotropic, angle-dependent behavior. We also demonstrate a mirror symmetry between fermions with opposite spin directions, leading to the emergence of a transverse spin current that flows parallel to the interface. Additionally, we show that the $\alpha$-vector acts as a source for the dynamics of the spin-density wave and observe the formation of an indirect gap in the conductance of the junction. Our findings highlight the unique transmission characteristics and spin transport phenomena in normal metal/p-wave magnet junctions, paving the way for potential applications in spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Electronic flying qubits offer an interesting alternative to photonic qubits: electrons propagate slower, hence easier to control in real time, and Coulomb interaction enables direct entanglement between different qubits. Although their coherence time is limited, flying electrons in the form of picosecond plasmonic pulses could be competitive in terms of the number of achievable coherent operations. The key challenge in achieving this critical milestone is the development of a new technology capable of injecting 'on-demand' single-electron wavepackets into quantum devices, with temporal durations comparable to or shorter than the device dimensions. Here, we take a significant step towards achieving this regime in a quantum nanoelectronic system by injecting ultrashort single-electron plasmonic pulses into a 14-micrometer-long Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our results establish that quantum coherence is robust under the on-demand injection of ultrashort plasmonic pulses, as evidenced by the observation of coherent oscillations in the single-electron regime. Building on this, our results demonstrate for the first time the existence of a new "non-adiabatic" regime that is prominent at high frequencies. This breakthrough highlights the potential of flying qubits as a promising alternative to localised qubit architectures, offering advantages such as a reduced hardware footprint, enhanced connectivity, and scalability for quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</p>

            <p>Three types of cycles are identified in the quantum jump trajectories of the Scovil--Schulz-DuBois (SSDB) machine: an R-cycle as refrigeration, an H-cycle as a heat engine, and an N-cycle in which the machine is neutral. The statistics of these cycles are investigated via a semi-Markov process method. We find that in the large time limit, whether the machine operates as a heat engine or refrigerator depends on the ratio between the numbers of R-cycles and H-cycles per unit time. Further increasing the hot bath temperature above a certain threshold does not increase the machine's power output. The cause is that, in this situation, the N-cycle has a greater probability than the H-cycle and R-cycle. Although the SSDB machine operates by randomly switching between these three cycles, at the level of a single quantum jump trajectory, its heat engine efficiency and the refrigerator's coefficient of performance remain constant.</p>

            <p>We present an approach for evaluating Wannier functions, offering an alternative perspective on their role in many-body systems. Unlike traditional methods, such as the maximally localized Wannier functions approach, which focuses on minimizing the function tails, our approach emphasizes these tails. Using perturbative analytical approximations and extensive numerical simulations on an exactly solvable model, we address nonstandard Hubbard terms and demonstrate their critical influence on many-body dynamics. Specifically, we study tunneling dynamics in arbitrary double-well potentials, moving beyond the standard Hubbard model to include nonstandard terms such as density-induced tunneling and pair tunneling. Our results reveal that these terms significantly modify the dynamics predicted by the standard Hubbard model: density-induced tunneling modifies the single-particle tunneling parameter $\Omega_0$, while pair tunneling enables coherent propagation not captured by the standard model. We show that the discrepancies between the standard and nonstandard Hubbard models grow with increasing interaction strength, potentially leading to novel transport behaviors. However, at lower interaction strengths, both models converge, as nonstandard terms become negligible. These findings have important implications for phenomena such as superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene and metal-insulator transitions. Our model aligns well with numerical simulations of lowest-band parameters and is strongly supported by experimental observations of second-order atom tunneling in optical double-well potentials. This strong agreement with experimental data highlights the accuracy and potential of our approach in providing a more comprehensive framework for describing complex many-body systems than the standard Hubbard model.</p>

Due to introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer, we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/AlGaN interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only one order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with the changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggests that the strains are responsible for the 2D electron gas density enhancement (reduction of the piezoelectric polarization in the GaN channel). Nevertheless, this finding is probably insufficient to fully explain the observed high 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). Finally, the possibility of application of such high-density 2D electron gas with low sheet resistance to transistors, emitters and detectors was discussed.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Quantum Hall Effect Based on Weyl Orbits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiong-Hao Wang, Yan-Bin Yang, Yong Xu</p>
            <p>The fractional quantum Hall effect is a well-known demonstration of strongly correlated topological phases in two dimensions. However, the extension of this phenomenon into a three-dimensional context has yet to be achieved. Recently, the three-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect based on Weyl orbits has been experimentally observed in a topological semimetallic material under a magnetic field. This motivates us to ask whether the Weyl orbits can give rise to the fractional quantum Hall effect when their Landau level is partially filled in the presence of interactions. Here we theoretically demonstrate that the fractional quantum Hall states based on Weyl orbits can emerge in a Weyl semimetal when a Landau level is one-third filled. Using concrete models for Weyl semimetals in magnetic fields, we project the Coulomb interaction onto a single Landau level from the Weyl orbit and find that the ground state of the many-body Hamiltoian is triply degenerate. We further show that the ground states exhibit the many-body Chern number of $1/3$ and the uniform occupation of electrons in both momentum and real space, implying that they are the fractional quantum Hall states. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, the states are spatially localized on two surfaces hosting Fermi arcs. Additionally, our findings suggest that the excitation properties of these states resemble those of the Laughlin state in two dimensions, as inferred from the particle entanglement spectrum of the ground states.</p>

When a Rashba spin-orbit interaction and a nearest-neighbor Kondo interaction is introduced, the low-energy Majorana bands become gapped and develop Chern numbers, protecting unidirectionally propagating Majorana edge modes.

            <h2>On inequalities of shear modulus contributions in disordered elastic bodies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J.P. Wittmer, H. Xu</p>
            <p>We investigate generic inequalities of various contributions to the shear modulus $\mu$ in ensembles of amorphous elastic bodies. We focus first on a simple elastic network model with connectivity matrices (CMs) which are either annealed or quenched, at or out of equilibrium. The stress-fluctuation formalism relation for $\mu$ is rewritten as $\mu = \mu_1 + \mu_a$ with $\mu_1 \ge 0$ characterizing the variance of the quenched shear stresses and $\mu_a$ being a simple average over all states and CMs. For equilibrium CM-distributions $\mu_a$ becomes equivalent to the shear modulus of annealed systems, i.e. $\mu_a \ge 0$, while more generally $\mu_a$ may become strongly negative as shown by considering a temperature quench and a scalar active two-temperature model. Consistent relations are also found for glass-forming colloids where $\mu-\mu_1=\mu_a=0$ for equilibrium ensembles, i.e. $\mu$ is set by the quenched shear stresses, while $\mu_a$ becomes again negative otherwise.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tan Van Vu, Hisao Hayakawa</p>
            <p>The Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive physical phenomenon where a hot system cools faster than a warm one. In recent years, theoretical analyses of the Mpemba effect have been developed for microscopic systems and experimentally verified. However, the conventional theory relies on a specific choice of distance measure to quantify relaxation speed, leading to several theoretical ambiguities. In this Letter, we derive a rigorous quantification of the Mpemba effect based on thermomajorization theory, referred to as the thermomajorization Mpemba effect. This approach resolves all existing ambiguities and provides a unification of the conventional Mpemba effect across all monotone measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the thermomajorization Mpemba effect for Markovian dynamics, rigorously proving that it can occur in any temperature regime with fixed energy levels.</p>

            <p>Long-range correlations manifested as power spectral density scaling $1/f^\beta$ for frequency $f$ and a range of exponents $\beta$ are investigated for a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with distributed durations $\tau$. Closed-form expressions for the frequency power spectral density are derived for a one-sided exponential pulse function and several variants of bounded and unbounded power-law distributions of pulse durations ${P_\tau(\tau)\sim1/\tau^\alpha}$ with abrupt and smooth cutoffs. The asymptotic scaling relation $\beta=3-\alpha$ is demonstrated for $1<\alpha<3$ in the limit of an infinitely broad distribution $P_\tau(\tau)$. Logarithmic corrections to the frequency scaling are exposed at the boundaries of the long-range dependence regime, $\beta=0$ and $\beta=2$. Analytically demonstrated finite-size effects associated with distribution truncations are shown to reduce the frequency ranges of scale invariance by several decades. The regimes of validity of the $\beta=3-\alpha$ relation are clarified.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Kinetic Theory of the Linear Response for Weakly Disordered Multiband Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thierry Valet, Roberto Raimondi</p>
            <p>A quantum kinetic theory of the linear response to an electric field is provided from a controlled expansion of the Keldysh theory at leading order, for a multiband electron system with weak scalar disorder. The response is uniquely partitioned into intraband distribution functions and interband quantum coherences. A new explicit formula is provided for the latter, outlining their true nature as local dependent quantities, for which the mesoscopic gradients of the former is uncovered as a source term, opening a new research area. The precise connection with the Kubo formula in the ladder approximation is established. A pedagogical application to spin-orbit torque theory in the two dimensional electron gas demonstrates the striking efficiency of the quantum kinetic approach. Some important implications for the theory of orbital transport are also briefly discussed.</p>

            <p>The edge of a quantum critical system can exhibit multiple distinct types of boundary criticality. We use a numerical real-space renormalization group (RSRG) to study the boundary criticality of a 2d quantum Ising model with random exchange couplings and transverse fields, whose bulk exhibits an infinite randomness critical point. This approach enables an asymptotically numerically exact extraction of universal scaling data from very large systems with many thousands of spins that cannot be efficiently simulated directly. We identify three distinct classes of boundary criticality, and extract key scaling exponents governing boundary-boundary and boundary-bulk correlations and dynamics. We anticipate that this approach can be generalized to studying a broad class of (disordered) boundary criticality, including symmetry-enriched criticality and edge modes of gapless symmetry-protected topological states, in contexts were other numerical methods are restricted to one-dimensional chains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nobuyuki Umetsu, Michael Quinsat, Susumu Hashimoto, Tsuyoshi Kondo, Masaki Kado</p>
            <p>The motion of chiral magnetic domain walls (DWs) driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied in heavy metal/ferromagnet heterostructures with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This study specifically focuses on SOT-driven DWs in near Bloch-states, which we refer to as ``quasi-Bloch DWs". These quasi-Bloch DWs exhibit slower motion compared to Neel-type DWs, offering potential for achieving highly controllable DW positions. Here, we investigate the characteristics of SOT-driven motion of quasi-Bloch DWs in perpendicularly magnetized ultra-thin films consisting of W/CoFeB/MgO. For analyzing the DW motion, we employ a one-dimensional model incorporating parameters derived from experimental data obtained from our samples. Our model successfully reproduces the experimental results, which reveal variations in the direction and threshold current density of DW motion among different samples. Through theoretical analysis, we unveil that the DW remains in quasi-Bloch states during motion, with SOT serving as the primary driving force rather than spin transfer torque (STT). The direction of motion is determined not only by the sign combination of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and spin Hall angle but also by the strength of DMI, STT, and extrinsic DW pinning. Furthermore, we provide analytical expressions for the threshold current density required for SOT-driven quasi-Bloch DW motion. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of future DW devices with specific film structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Poonam Sharma, Vaishali Roondhe, Alok Shukla</p>
            <p>Recently, the successful synthesis of the pentagonal form of PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$) was reported [Liu~\emph{et al.}, Nature Materials \textbf{23}, 1339 (2024)]. In this work, we present an extensive first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) based computational study of vacancies in this material. Our study covers the evolution of the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of various defect configurations and compares those to the pristine monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$). We find that V$_{Pd}$ (V$_{Te}$) is the most stable defect in the~\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer in the Te-rich (Pd-rich) limit. The defects alter the electronic properties of the monolayer significantly, leading to changes in their magnetic and optical properties due to the emergence of midgap impurity states. The defect complex V$_{Pd+4Te}$ is found to induce spin-polarization in the system with a total magnetic moment of 1.87 $\mu_{B}$. The obtained low diffusion energy barriers of 1.13 eV (in-plane) and 0.063 eV (top-bottom) corresponding to V$_{Te}$ indicates its facile migration probability is higher in the top-bottom direction at room temperature, as revealed by AIMD simulations as well. In order to guide the experimentalists, we also simulated the scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) images corresponding to all the defect configurations. Moreover, we also computed the electron-beam energies required for creating mono-vacancies. In the optical absorption spectra of the defective configurations, finite peaks appear below the band edge that are unique to the respective defective configuration. We have also computed the excess polarizability of the defective configurations with respect to the pristine one and found that maximum changes occur in the infrared and visible regions, providing insights into the change in their optical response as compared to the pristine monolayer.</p>

            <p>We investigate the orientational properties of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous tetrahedral 4-patch fluid (Kern--Frenkel model). Using integral equations, either (i) HNC or (ii) a modified HNC scheme with simulation input, the full orientational dependence of pair and direct correlation functions is determined. Density functionals for the inhomogeneous problem are constructed via two different methods. The first, molecular density functional theory, utilizes the full direct correlation function and an isotropic hard-sphere bridge functional. The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. Comparison to simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers show a similar performance of the two functionals. Machine learning strategies are discussed to eliminate residual differences, with the goal of obtaining machine-learning enhanced functionals for the general anisotropic fluid.</p>

            <p>Challenge to control the quantum states of matter via light have been at the forefront of modern research on driven quantum matter. We explore the imprinting effects of structured light on superconductors, demonstrating how the quantum numbers of light-specifically spin angular momentum, orbital angular momentum, and radial order-can be transferred to the superconducting order parameter and control vortex dynamics. Using Laguerre-Gaussian beams, we show that by tuning the quantum numbers and the amplitude of the electric field, it is possible to manipulate a variety of vortex behaviors, including breathing vortex pairs, braiding vortex pairs, vortex droplets, supervortices, and swirling 2D vortex rings. More complex structure of vortex-clusters, such as vortex-flake structures, and standing wave motions, also emerge under specific quantum numbers. These results demonstrate the ability to control SC vortex motion and phase structures through structured light, offering potential applications in quantum fluids and optical control of superconducting states. Our findings present a diagram that links light's quantum numbers to the resulting SC vortex behaviors, highlighting the capacity of light to transfer its symmetry onto superconducting condensates. We point that this approach represents the extension of the printing to quantum printing by light in a coherent state of electrons.</p>

            <p>We study evaporation and precipitate formation mechanics of bacteria-laden liquid bridge using experimental and theoretical analysis. Aqueous suspension of motile and non-motile Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa typically found in contaminated food and water were used in liquid bridge configuration between hydrophilic substrates. Using inverse logarithmic evaporation flux model, we study volume regression for cylindrical/catenoid volume models with confinement distance as a parameter. For all confinement distances, the regression is linear on normalizing both volume and time as in the case of pure sessile drop. However, in normalized volume and dimensional time space, we observe non-linearities as the evaporation time scales non linearly with the confinement distance. The non-linearities were captured using the catenoid model. The catenoid model conforms to the experimental volume regression data at all confinement distances, and the transient liquid bridge interface evolution profile at high confinement distance. We also study the precipitate pattern and bacterial distribution using micro/nano characterization techniques. We show the average precipitate pattern for both sessile and higher confinement distance resembles coffee ring type deposits although the underlying bacterial distribution differs. For lower confinement, we observe pattern resulting from a combination of coffee ring effect, stick-slick motion, and thin film instability. The reduction in confinement distance causes an altered bacterial agglomeration, resulting in a multi-pattern network instead of a single circumferential edge deposition. We show the aerial size of motile bacteria increases with decreasing confinement, whereas the size for non-motile bacteria remains constant in the precipitate.</p>

            <p>A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.</p>

Our results suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully gapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, $\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic gap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single anisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of $\lambda(T)$ and $\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are qualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with the superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band structure.

            <p>Altermagnets exhibit nonrelativistic spin splitting due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and have been garnering significant attention as promising materials for spintronic applications. In contrast, conventional antiferromagnets without spin splitting seem not to have any symmetry breaking and have drawn less attention. However, we show that conventional antiferromagnets with a nonzero propagation vector (Q vector) bring about nontrivial symmetry breakings. The incompatibility between the Q vector and nonsymmorphic symmetry leads to macroscopic symmetry breaking without lifting spin degeneracy. Moreover, the hidden altermagnetic spin splitting in the electronic structure gives rise to various emergent responses. To examine our prediction, we perform first-principles calculations for MnS2 and investigate its multiferroic properties, such as nonlinear transport and optical activity. Our findings reveal unique properties in conventional antiferromagnets, providing another perspective for designing spintronic materials.</p>

Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging.

We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the "Mozzarella Phase" and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.</p>

Here, we systematically investigate the roles of real and unrecoverable interfacial contact areas at the electrode/Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl interface in driving the impedance rise. By controlling contact geometries and applied pressures, we identify their distinct contributions to the impedance spectra and quantify their influence on the interfacial resistance and transport. Experiments reveal that interfacial resistance varies strongly with recoverable contact area and applied pressure following power law scaling, with exponents of -1 and -0.5, respectively. Moreover, distributed contacts result in lower impedance due to smaller potential gradients and a more uniform potential distribution. Continuum simulations of the contact geometries predict interfacial resistances in agreement with experiments.

            <p>Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However, existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr$_3$/MnPSe$_3$/CrBr$_3$ vertical heterostructure, enabling genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

Yet, training physical neural networks are difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e. training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation this http URL, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN) and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of physical process. Using magnetic texture defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja's learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform towards efficient autonomous training directly in materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Chen, Thomas Barthel</p>
            <p>Tensor networks developed in the context of condensed matter physics try to approximate order-$N$ tensors with a reduced number of degrees of freedom that is only polynomial in $N$ and arranged as a network of partially contracted smaller tensors. As we have recently demonstrated in the context of quantum many-body physics, computation costs can be further substantially reduced by imposing constraints on the canonical polyadic (CP) rank of the tensors in such networks [arXiv:2205.15296]. Here, we demonstrate how tree tensor networks (TTN) with CP rank constraints and tensor dropout can be used in machine learning. The approach is found to outperform other tensor-network-based methods in Fashion-MNIST image classification. A low-rank TTN classifier with branching ratio $b=4$ reaches a test set accuracy of 90.3\% with low computation costs. Consisting of mostly linear elements, tensor network classifiers avoid the vanishing gradient problem of deep neural networks. The CP rank constraints have additional advantages: The number of parameters can be decreased and tuned more freely to control overfitting, improve generalization properties, and reduce computation costs. They allow us to employ trees with large branching ratios, substantially improving the representation power.</p>

            <p>The Langevin equation is ubiquitously employed to numerically simulate plasmas, colloids and electrolytes. However, the usual assumption of white noise becomes untenable when the system is subject to an external AC electric field. This is because the charged particles in the system, which provide the thermal bath for the particle transport, become themselves responsive to the AC field and the thermal noise is field-dependent and non-Markovian. We theoretically study the particle diffusivity in a Langevin transport model for a tagged charged particle immersed in a dense system of charged particles (plus also, possibly, other neutral particles) that act as the thermal bath, under an external AC electric field. This is done by properly accounting for the effects of the AC field on the thermal bath statistics. We analytically derive the time-dependent generalized diffusivity $D(t)$ for different initial conditions. The generalized diffusivity exhibits damped oscillatory-like behaviour with initial very large peaks, where the generalized diffusion coefficient is enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to the infinite-time steady-state value. The latter coincides with the Stokes-Einstein diffusivity in the absence of external field. For initial conditions where the external field is already on at $t=0$ and the system is thermalized under DC conditions for $t \leq 0$, the short-time behaviour is hyperballistic, $MSD \sim t^4$ (where MSD is the mean-squared displacement), leading to giant enhancement of the particle transport. Finally, the theory elucidates the role of medium polarization on the local Lorentz field, and allows for estimates of the effective electric charge due to polarization by the surrounding charges.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo for computing observables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mancheon Han, Hyowon Park, Sangkook Choi</p>
            <p>The recent development of logical quantum processors marks a pivotal transition from the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era to the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era. These devices have the potential to address classically challenging problems with polynomial computational time using quantum properties. However, they remain susceptible to noise, necessitating noise resilient algorithms. We introduce Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo (QZMC), a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm that demonstrates resilience to device noise and Trotter errors while showing polynomial computational cost for a gapped system. QZMC computes static and dynamic properties without requiring initial state overlap or variational parameters, offering reduced quantum circuit depth.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Isaac H. Kim, Xiang Li, Ting-Chun Lin, John McGreevy, Bowen Shi</p>
            <p>Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.</p>

            <p>Life uses non-equilibrium mechanisms to create ordered structures not attainable at equilibrium; the resulting order is assumed to provide functional benefits that outweigh costs of time and energy needed by these mechanisms. Here, we show that models of DNA replication and self-assembly, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve error correcting mechanisms like kinetic proofreading and dynamic instability through selection for fast replication alone. We abstract these results into a general framework that predicts a counterintuitive ''order through speed'' effect if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. We test our results against recent mutational screens of proofreading polymerases. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can evolve even before that order is directly functional, with consequences for the evolution of mutation rates, viral capsid assembly, and the origin of life.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marten Reehorst, Slava Rychkov, Benoit Sirois, Balt C. van Rees</p>
            <p>We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d < 4$. Our results show that $N_c> 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Long-Range Quantum Tunneling via Matter Wave</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Xing Yang, Si-Yuan Bai, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>Quantum tunneling is a quantum phenomenon in which a microscopic object crosses through a potential barrier even if its energy cannot overcome the barrier. A general belief is that tunneling occurs only when the barrier width is comparable to, or smaller than the de Broglie's wavelength of the object. Here, we study the tunneling of an ultracold atom among $N$ far-separated trapping potentials in a state-selective optical lattice and present a mechanism to realize long-range tunneling. We find that, mediated by the propagating matter wave emitted from the atom, coherent tunneling of the atom to the remote lattices occurs as long as bound states are present in the energy spectrum of the system formed by the atom and its matter wave. Going beyond the Markovian approximation, and breaking through the conventional distance constraint, our result opens another avenue to realizing tunneling and gives a guideline to developing tunneling devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum noise induced nonreciprocity for single photon transport in parity-time symmetric systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dibyendu Roy, G. S. Agarwal</p>
            <p>We show nonreciprocal light propagation for single-photon inputs due to quantum noise in coupled optical systems with gain and loss. We consider two parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of either two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides evanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even without noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the broken phase.</p>

            <h2>Random unitaries in extremely low depth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Schuster, Jonas Haferkamp, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly}(\log n)$ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly}(\log \log n)$ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly}(\log n)$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing PRU constructions. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thorsten B. Wahl, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Adrien Bouhon, Gaurav Chaudhary, Robert-Jan Slager</p>
            <p>We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionic and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, forming the basis for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.</p>

            <h2>Efficient algorithms for surface density of states in topological photonic and acoustic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Xin Sha, Ming-Yao Xia, Ling Lu, Yi Yang</p>
            <p>Topological photonics and acoustics have recently garnered wide research interests for their topological ability to manipulate the light and sound at surfaces. Conventionally, the supercell technique is the standard approach to calculating these boundary effects, whereas it consumes increasingly large computational resources as the supercell size grows. Additionally, it falls short in differentiating the surface states at opposite boundaries and from bulk states due to the finite size of systems. To overcome the limitations, here we provide two complementary efficient methods for obtaining the ideal topological surface states of a semi-infinite system. The first one is the cyclic reduction method, which is based on iteratively inverting the Hamiltonian for a single unit cell, and the other is the transfer matrix method, which relies on the eigenanalysis of a transfer matrix for a pair of unit cells. Benchmarks show that, compared to the traditional supercell method, the cyclic reduction method can reduce both memory and time consumption by two orders of magnitude; the transfer matrix method can reduce memory by an order of magnitude, take less than half the time, and achieve high accuracy. Our methods are applicable to more complex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched structures. As examples, the surface-density-of-states spectra of photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic topological insulators are demonstrated. Our computational schemes enable direct comparisons with near-field scanning measurements and expedite the exploration of topological artificial materials and the design of topological devices.</p>

            <h2>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</p>

            <p>This work presents steps toward the design of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in InAsP quantum dots (QD) embedded in an InP semiconducting nanowire in contact with a p-type superconductor described by the Kitaev Hamiltonian. The single particle spectrum is obtained from million atom atomistic calculations with QNANO and many-electron spectra using exact diagonalization (ED) and the hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) method. A variational ansatz is constructed to capture the ground state of the system by utilizing a generalized form of the analytical solution for a particular set of parameters. By systematically deviating from the analytically solvable regime while maintaining the system in the topological phase (TP), the effectiveness of the variational function in reproducing the correct ground state and topological properties of the system is evaluated. This is done through a quantum algorithm for a many-body state containing MZM. The results are compared with exact solution in topological phase and demonstrate the capability of VQE, along with classical simulations, to accurately model the many-body spectra in topologically nontrivial state.</p>

            <p>We present a symmetry-agnostic topology optimization framework for photonic-crystal structures based on computation of the photonic density of states in a manner analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration. We provide a generalization of the approach that allows for computations at different scales with the additional scales being analogous to integration over the full Brillouin zone and to regimes between the two limiting cases of full Brillouin-zone integration and $\Gamma$-point integration, though these other scales do not preserve the symmetry-agnostic nature of the $\Gamma$-point framework. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the problem of inverting photonic or phononic bandstructures and to the treatment of the frequency-dependent optical response of materials. Finally, we show that at the symmetry-agnostic scale analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration, we can recover a known two-dimensional photonic crystal for the TM polarization. A key insight of our work is the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic bandgap must be sampled in order to observe photonic-crystal structures.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the possibility of emergent supersymmetry in critical random systems, we study a field theory model with a quartic potential of one superfield, possessing the Parisi-Sourlas supertranslation symmetry. Within perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion, we find nine non-trivial scale invariant renormalization group fixed points, but only one of them is conformal. We, however, believe scale invariance without conformal invariance cannot occur without a sophisticated mechanism because it predicts the existence of a non-conserved but non-renormalized vector operator called virial current, whose existence must be non-generic. We show that the virial current in this model is related to the supercurrent by supertranslation. The supertranslation Ward-Takahashi identity circumvents the genericity argument, explaining its non-renormalization property.</p>

            <p>Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large dynamic range is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <p>The tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicals and diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low-lying excited states by fine-tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM-derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on TTM-derived diradicals to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis focuses on a series of symmetric TTM-derived diradicals with singlet ground state, featuring radical moieties linked by pi-conjugated spacers of different length. The nature of the lowest excited electronic states that control their photophysical behaviour is discussed in detail. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM-TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The lowest excited states of the diradicals differ qualitatively from those of TTM: two novel low-lying states emerge in the diradical, due to charge resonance (CR) between the two radical units. The lowest CR state is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue-shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM-ph-TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM-derived diradicals</p>

In agreement with experimental observations, we find that the Hall conductivity remains unchanged. However, the coupling to the cavity induces a second-order quantum reactance effect, contributing distinctly to the longitudinal AC conductivity. This effect arises from the exchange of energy between the QH fluid and cavity photons. Beyond the topological response, we show that the cavity couples to collective excitations, resulting in a shift of the Kohn mode frequency. Our methods are broadly applicable to both integral and fractional QH liquids, and our results offer a universal perspective on the protection of topological properties against long-range interactions induced by electromagnetic cavity modes.</p>

            <p>The primary function of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to convert electrons into photons. However, only 25 % of the electronic states (singlets) in electrically excited fluorescent molecules can emit light, which is why triplet harvesting has attracted significant attention. Specifically, one often aims to maximize the rate of triplet-to-singlet conversion, while at the same time, it is crucial to depopulate the singlets fast enough -- before they convert to triplets or interact with other excited states, potentially breaking molecular bonds. Planar microcavities provide a viable architecture to address these issues. By confining the emitters within planar microcavities one can couple the excitons to cavity modes and engineer the population dynamics to one's liking. While the weak-coupling regime is renowned for Purcell-enhanced emission, strongly coupled excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates known as polaritons. To fully understand and optimize exciton-photon interactions and light-emission mechanisms across various coupling regimes, a unified theory of optically coupled (and uncoupled) OLEDs is needed. In this article, we introduce a quantum master equation model spanning the zero-, weak-, and strong-coupling regimes. We derive the different rates using Fermi's golden rule and Marcus theory, show how the different regimes converge, and finally evaluate the internal quantum efficiencies in all cases.</p>

In the noninteracting case, the QSHI with space inversion and/or uniaxial spin rotation symmetry undergoes a topological transition into a normal insulator phase at a critical magnetic field $B_{\rm c}$. The exciton condensation in the lowest Landau levels is triggered by Coulomb interactions in the vicinity of $B_{\rm c}$ at low temperature and spontaneously breaks the inversion and the spin rotation symmetries. We propose that the electron spin resonance spectroscopy with the ac magnetic field also aligned in the perpendicular direction can directly probe the exciton condensation order. Our results should apply to QSHIs such as the InAs/GaSb quantum wells and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <h2>Realizing Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing driven topological Majorana zero modes and superconducting diode effect in helical Shiba chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayak Bhowmik, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BDG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in Shiba chain where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the asymmetric FFLO state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p>We propose an architecture for bit flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit flip code. Thereby, without detuning from the Kramers' point, reflectometry off a single coupled resonator accomplishes a projective measurement of multiple stabilizers. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of logical quantum gates. The concept is experimentally feasible.</p>

            <h2>Theory of superconducting proximity effect in hole-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Michel Pino, Rubén Seoane-Souto, Maria José Calderón, Ramón Aguado, José Carlos Abadillo-Uriel</p>
            <p>Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>Quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum geometric tensor, is pivotal in diverse physical phenomena in quantum materials. In condensed matter systems, quantum geometry refers to the geoemtric properties of Bloch states in the Brillouin zone. This pedagogical review provides an accessible introduction to the concept of quantum geometry, emphasizing its extensive implications across multiple domains. Specifically, we discuss the role of quantum geometry in optical responses, Landau levels, and fractional Chern insulators, as well as its influence on superfluid weight, spin stiffness, exciton condensates, electron-phonon coupling, etc. By integrating these topics, we underscore the pervasive significance of quantum geometry in understanding emergent behaviors in quantum materials. Finally, we present an outlook on open questions and potential future directions, highlighting the need for continued exploration in this rapidly developing field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiabin Yu, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, B. Andrei Bernevig</p>
            <p>We define the absolute Wilson loop winding and prove that it bounds the quantum metric from below. This Wilson loop lower bound naturally reproduces the known Chern and Euler bounds of the quantum metric, and provides an explicit lower bound of the quantum metric due to the time-reversal protected $Z_2$ index, answering a hitherto open question. In general, the Wilson loop lower bound can be applied to any other topological invariants characterized by Wilson loop winding, such as the particle-hole $Z_2$ index. As physical consequences of the $Z_2$ bound, we show that the time-reversal $Z_2$ index bounds superfluid weight and optical conductivity from below, and bounds the direct gap of a band insulator from above.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya Bahulikar, Steven L. Richardson, Rodrick Kuate Defo</p>
            <p>The elucidation of the mechanism of Sn$V^-$ formation in diamond is especially important as the Sn$V^-$ color center has the potential to be a superior single-photon emitter when compared to the N$V$ and to other Group IV color centers. The typical formation of the Sn$V$ involves placing Sn in diamond by ion implantation, but the formation of a charged Sn$V$ species requires an additional complication. This complication is related to the energy cost associated with electronic transitions within the host diamond. Effectively, producing the Sn$V^-$ charge state using an electron obtained from a band edge of the host diamond is less energetically favorable than having the Sn$V^-$ receive an electron from a neighboring donor dopant. Among donor dopants, substitutional N (N$_\text{C}$) is always present in even the purest synthetic or natural diamond sample. The mechanism of electron donation by N$_\text{C}$ has been proposed by Collins for charging the N$V$ in diamond and it has been used to interpret many experimental results. Therefore, in this paper we use DFT to explore the pathways for the formation of the Sn$V^-$ charge state due to electron donation arising from the presence of N$_\text{C}$ in the host diamond. Explicitly, defect concentrations are calculated in equilibrium in each of the explored pathways to determine the yield of the Sn$V^-$ throughout each of the pathways. The importance of our work is to suggest experimental ways of enhancing the yield of charged states like the Sn$V^-$ in diamond for transformative applications in optoelectronics and quantum information.</p>

            <p>A knowledge gap exists for flows and transport phenomena at the Angstrom scale when the Poisson Nernst Planck equation based on the concept of electrical double layer (EDL) fails. We discovered that streaming conductance becomes pressure dependent in Angstrom channels using latent track membranes. The streaming current emerges only when the applied pressure exceeds a threshold value, which is inconsistent with the existing knowledge as a constant. With increasing channel size, we found that the pressure dependent streaming conductance phenomenon weakens and vanishes into a constant streaming conductance regime when the mean channel radius exceeds 2 nm. The effective surface potential derived from the stream conductance that divides conduction anomalously increases as the channel narrows. We suspect the pressure dependent streaming current is due to the reinforced Coulomb interaction between counterions and deprotonated carboxyl groups at the surface, which is close to the ion channel but different from the electrified 2D materials. The streaming current emerged due to hydrodynamic friction when the counterions were released from the surface. We approximated the stochastic process of counterion dissociation by 1D Kramer escape theory framework and defined the Damkohler Number to describe the transition from nonlinear streaming conductance regime to linear regime as functions of applied pressure and channel radius and well explained the enhanced effective surface potential in confinement.</p>

            <p>Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model with hard-core bosons. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor, acquire a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. The sharper and more concentrated spectral weight of the roton mode is observed when approaching the FCI-CDW transition while the single-particle gap remains intact. We also resolve the graviton mode around $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone by measuring the dynamic quadrupolar density correlations. Interestingly, we not only reveal the graviton response is chiral for a certain FCI, but also show the different chiralities of the graviton of opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time. Our results offer the clear spectral observations of magnetoroton and chiral graviton in a lattice model of FCI and will have relevance towards the on-going experiments of tunable FCIs in quantum moiré materials.</p>

            <p>A recently discovered family of Kagome lattice materials, $\emph{A}\mathrm{V}_{3}\mathrm{Sb}_{5}$($\emph{A}$= $\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs}$), has attracted great interest, especially in the debate over its dominant superconducting pairing symmetry. To explore this issue, we study the superconducting pairing behavior within the Kagome-Hubbard model through the constrained path Monte Carlo method. It is found that doping around the Dirac point generates a dominant next-nearest-neighbour-$d$ pairing symmetry driven by on-site Coulomb interaction $U$. However, when considering the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, it may induce nearest-neighbor-$p$ pairing to become the preferred pairing symmetry. Our results provide useful information to identify the dominant superconducting pairing symmetry in $\emph{A}\mathrm{V}_{3}\mathrm{Sb}_{5}$ family.</p>

We observe the polariton dividing into multiple branches, akin to coupled oscillators. Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. A distinctive trait of moiré polar crystals is their spatially varying near-field response, offering robust signals for the experimental confirmation.</p>

            <p>Magnetic-free nonreciprocal optical devices that can prevent backscattering of signals are essential for integrated optical information processing. The achieved nonreciprocal behaviors mostly rely on various dispersive effects in optical media, which give rise to dispersive modulations of the transverse beam profile, such as spatial broadening and discretization, of the incident signals. Such deformation inevitably reduces the matching with subsequent components for information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate the nonreciprocal transverse localization of light in a moiré photonic lattice induced in atomic vapors. When the probe field is set to co- or counter-propagate with the coupling field formed by superposing two identical honeycomb beams in a certain rotation angle, the output pattern can exhibit localized or dispersive behavior. The localization in the forward case is derived from the moiré structure, and the nonreciprocal behaviors (in both beam size and transmitted intensity) are introduced by the thermal motion of atoms. The thermal-motion-induced Doppler effect can destroy the coherent condition for electromagnetically induced transparency in the backward case, because of which the probe beam becomes immune to the modulation of the coupling field. The current work provides an approach to control the transverse beam profile in one-way transmission.</p>

We discuss a collective enhancement of the vacuum Rabi splitting and study super- and sub-radiant states that arise from the cavity-mediated coupling both in the resonant and dispersive regimes. Moreover, we demonstrate a two-photon transition that emerges between the ground and excited states of the new optical compound. Our experimental data are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian and open the door to the realization of hybrid light-matter materials.</p>

            <p>Optically active defects often play a crucial role in governing the light emission as well as the electronic properties of materials. Moreover, defect-mediated states in the mid-gap region can trap electrons, thus opening a path for the recombination of electrons and holes in lower energy states that may require phonons in the process. Considering this, we have probed electron-phonon interaction in halide perovskite systems with the introduction of defects and investigated the thermal effect on this interaction. Here, we report Raman spectroscopy study of the thermal evolution of electron-phonon coupling, which is tunable with the crystal growth conditions, in the halide perovskite systems Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2NaInCl6. The signature of electron-phonon coupling is observed as a Fano anomaly in the lowest frequency phonon mode (51 cm-1) which evolves with temperature. In addition, we observe a broad band in the photoluminescence (PL) measurements for the defect-mediated systems, which is otherwise absent in defect-free halide perovskite. The simultaneous observation of the Fano anomaly in the Raman spectrum and the emergence of the PL band suggests the defect-mediated mid-gap states and the consequent existence of electron-phonon coupling in the double perovskite.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity and nontrivial topology are highly sought-after phenomena in quantum materials. While many topological crystalline materials have been found to exhibit superconductivity, their presence in quasicrystals - materials with a unique aperiodic yet ordered structure - has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we report the discovery of superconductivity in a monoclinic approximant to the decagonal quasicrystal Al$_{13}$Os$_{4}$, that exhibits a high superconducting transition temperature and a nontrivial electronic structure. The resistivity, magnetization, specific heat, and $\mu$SR measurements confirm superconductivity with a critical temperature of $\sim5.47$ K. Detailed electronic structure and symmetry analysis reveal nontrivial state with $\mathcal{Z}_{2}=1$ and spin-polarized conducting surface states. Importantly, we identify three-dimensional saddle point van Hove singularities with substantial flat energy dispersion at the Fermi level, which can enhance superconductivity. Our results highlight a rich interplay between superconductivity and nontrivial electronic states in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4}$, demonstrating it as a unique platform for exploring unconventional superconducting states in quasicrystalline materials.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi Chen, Fa-Jie Wang, Zhen Bi, Zhi-Da Song</p>
            <p>Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic STI - which has no band insulator correspondence - characterized by the half-quantized magneto-electric polarization $P_3\!=\!\theta/(2\pi)$. A $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$. However, we prove that, if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$, the topological state with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ cannot be realized in band insulators where $C_{4}T$ is exact. Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find that an STI with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ can arise in Anderson insulators with disorders respecting $C_{4}T$ on average. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram using the transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessible system size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surface states and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk. As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from both clean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactions cannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped clean system. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to other crystalline symmetries.</p>

At $x = 1/4$, the centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$/$mmc$) promotes Co-Co interactions leading to the formation of an $A$-type antiferromagnetic structure phase with a transition temperature of $T_N^A$ = 169 K. At $x = 1/3$, the non-centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$22) induces a lower-temperature magnetic phase with $T_N^S$ = 28 K. We report the coexistence of both substructures within a superlattice, with a nuclear propagation vector of (1/3, 1/3, 0) relative to the host lattice. Single crystals of Co$_{0.28}$NbSe$_2$ exhibit both magnetic transitions, with $T_N^A$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/4$ phase and $T_N^S$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/3$ phase. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements confirm these transitions, although only the high-temperature $T_N^A$ phase significantly affects resistivity. We successfully isolate each phase in powder samples, while single crystals with an intercalation ratio of $x = 0.28$ display the coexistence of both phases in a single sample. Using single-crystal neutron diffraction, we solved the magnetic structure of the high-temperature centrosymmetric phase ($T_N^A$), and neutron powder diffraction revealed the double-$q$ magnetic structure of the low-temperature noncentrosymmetric phase ($T_N^S$)</p>

However, standard LBM formulation imposes some limitations on the applications of the method, particularly compressible fluids. In this paper, we introduce a new velocity discretization method to overcome some of these challenges. In this new formulation, the particle populations are discretized using a bump function that has a mean and a variance. This introduces enough independent degrees of freedom to set the equilibrium moments to the moments of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution up to and including the third moments. Consequently, the correct macroscopic fluid dynamics equations for compressible fluids are recovered. We validate our method using several benchmark simulations.</p>

            <p>Active colloidal particles typically exhibit a pronounced affinity for accumulating and being captured at boundaries. Here, we engineer long-range repulsive interactions between colloids that self-propel under an electric field and patterned obstacles. As a result of these interactions, particles turn away from obstacles and avoid accumulation. We show that by tuning the applied field frequency, we precisely and rapidly control the effective size of the obstacles and therefore modulate the particle approach distance. This feature allows us to achieve gating and tunable confinement of our active particles whereby they can access regions between obstacles depending on the applied field. Our work provides a versatile means to directly control confinement and organization, paving the way towards applications such as sorting particles based on motility or localizing active particles on demand.</p>

            <p>Cells and microorganisms employ dynamic shape changes to enable steering and avoidance for efficient spatial exploration and collective organization. In contrast, active colloids, their synthetic counterparts, currently lack similar abilities and strategies. Through physical interactions alone, here we create active colloidal molecules that spontaneously reconfigure their structure, unlike traditional active particles. We find that self-reconfiguration decouples reorientational dynamics from rotational diffusivity and bestows our active molecules additional reorientation capabilities. During encounters with neighbors, rapid conformational changes lead to self-steering and avoidance. At higher area fractions, reconfiguration-induced avoidance fully inhibits characteristic dynamic clustering, motility-induced phase separation and flocking; instead, the system retains a homogeneous structure comprising well-separated active units. Self-reconfiguring systems therefore present an exciting path towards autonomous motion beyond that of classical synthetic active matter.</p>

            <p>Ultrafast and nanoscale heat conduction demands a unified theoretical framework that rigorously bridges macroscopic transport equations with microscopic material properties derived from statistical this http URL empirical generalizations of Fourier's law often lack a solid microscopic foundation, failing to connect observed non-Fourier behavior with underlying atomic scale mechanisms. In this work, we present a time-domain theory of transient heat conduction rooted in Zwanzig's statistical theory of irreversible processes. Central to this framework is the time-domain transport function, Z(t), defined through equilibrium time-correlation functions of heat fluxes. This function generalizes the conventional concept of steady-state thermal conductivity, governing the transition of conduction dynamics from onset second sound type wave propagation at finite speeds to diffusion-dominated behavior across broad temporal and spatial scales. Unlike phonon hydrodynamic models that rely on mesoscopic constructs such as phonon drift velocity, our approach provides a quantitative and microscopic description of intrinsic memory effects in transient heat fluxes and applies universally to bulk materials at any temperature or length scale. By integrating atomistic-scale first-principles calculations with continuum-level macroscopic equations, this framework offers a robust foundation for numerical simulations of transient temperature fields. Furthermore, it facilitates the interpretation and design of transient thermal grating experiments using nanometer-scale heat sources and ultrafast laser systems in the extreme ultraviolet and x-ray wavelength ranges, advancing our understanding of heat dissipation dynamics.</p>

            <h2>BiFeO$_3$ nanoparticles at low-temperature using atomistic simulations -- surface charge distribution and terminations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mauro A. P. Goncalves, Monica Graf, Marek Pasciak, Jiri Hlinka</p>
            <p>This paper analyzes how the ferroelectric properties of cubic-like BiFeO$_3$ nanoparticles are affected by different terminations and charge distributions at the surface using ab-initio-based atomistic computational experiments. Our findings unveil multiple multidomain configurations and illustrate how the different order parameters evolve towards the surface. Interestingly, for neutral terminations, a non-rhombohedral phase of BiFeO$_3$ with a stripe-like polarization arrangement was stabilized. We evaluate the polarization, oxygen octahedra rotation, and volume variation for all the configurations obtained, taking advantage of the atomic-scale details provided by the methods used in this study.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Coherence Peak in Cuprate Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Li, Chao Mu, Pengfei Li, Wei Wu, Jiangping Hu, Tao Xiang, Kun Jiang, Jianlin Luo</p>
            <p>The Hebel-Slichter coherence peak, observed in the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ just below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, serves as a crucial experimental validation of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing symmetry in conventional superconductors. However, no coherence peak in $1/T_1$ has been observed in unconventional superconductors like cuprates. In this study, an unconventional coherence peak is identified for the first time using nuclear quadrupole resonance on YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$, pointing to a distinctive pairing symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate in nuclear quadrupole resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance with nuclear spin $I>1/2$ comprises the magnetic relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, which probes magnetic fluctuations, and the quadrupole relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm quad}$, which probes charge fluctuations. By utilizing $^{63}$Cu and $^{65}$Cu isotopes, we successfully distinguish $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$ and $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ and reveal the presence of the coherence peak in $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ but not in $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, in contrast to conventional superconductors. Our finding demonstrates that unconventional superconductors do not exhibit a coherence peak in $1/T_{1}$ when the relaxation is due to fluctuations of the hyperfine field. Conversely, a coherence peak is expected when the relaxation is caused by electric field gradient fluctuations, due to the different coherence factors between charge and magnetic fluctuations. Our successful measurements of $1/T_{1}$ for the chains of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ suggest that, should the conditions for predominant quadrupole relaxation be satisfied, this phenomenon could provide a novel approach to exploring the unconventional nature of the pairing mechanism in other superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Essentially degenerate hidden nodal lines in two-dimensional magnetic layer groups</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Ping Li, Chaoxi Cui, Lei Wang, Weikang Wu, Zeying Zhang, Zhi-Ming Yu, Yugui Yao</p>
            <p>According to the theory of group representations, the types of band degeneracy can be divided into accidental degeneracy and essential degeneracy. The essentially degenerate nodal lines (NLs) are typically resided on the high-symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone. Here, we propose a type of NL in two dimension that is essentially degenerate but is hidden within the high-symmetry planes, making it less observable, dubbed a hidden-essential nodal line (HENL). The existence of HENL is guaranteed as long as the system hosts a horizontal glide-mirror symmetry, hence such NLs can be widely found in both non-magnetic and magnetic systems. We perform an exhaustive search over all 528 magnetic layer groups (MLGs) for HENL that can be enforced by glide-mirror symmetry with both spinless and spinfull systems. We find that 122 candidate MLGs host spinless HENL, while 63 candidate MLGs demonstrate spinful HENL. In addition, we reveal that horizontal mirror and time-reversal symmetry in type-II and type-IV MLGs with spin-orbital coupling can enforce HENL formed. The 15 corresponding candidate MLGs have also been presented. Furthemore, we derive a few typical lattice models to characterize the existence for the HENL. For specific electronic fillings in real materials, namely 4$N$+2 in spinless systems (and 2$N$+1 in spinful systems), the presence of the HENLs in candidate MLGs is required regardless of the details of the systems. Using \emph{ab-initio} calculations, we further identify possible material candidates that realize spinless and spinful HENL. Moreover, spinful HENLs exhibit a novel persistent spin texture wih the characteristic of momentum-independent spin configuration. Our findings uncover a new type of topological semimetal state and offer an ideal platform to study the related physics of HENLs.</p>

            <h2>Spin Hall effect in 3d ferromagnetic metals for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization: A first-principles investigation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fanxing Zheng, Jianting Dong, Yizhuo Song, Meng Zhu, Xinlu Li, Jia Zhang</p>
            <p>Ferromagnetic metals, with the potential to generate spin current with unconventional spin polarization via the spin Hall effect, offer promising opportunities for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization and for the spin-orbit torque devices. In this study, we investigate two distinct spin Hall mechanisms in 3d ferromagnetic metals including spin-orbit coupling driven spin Hall effect in Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys, and non-relativistic spin Hall effect arising from anisotropic spin-polarized transport by taking L10-MnAl as an example. By employing first-principles calculations, we examine the temperature and alloy composition dependence of spin Hall conductivity in Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys. Our results reveal that the spin Hall conductivities with out-of-plane spin polarization in 3d ferromagnetic metals are at the order of 1000 \frac{\hbar}{2e} \left( \Omega \, \text{cm} \right)^{-1} at 300 K, but with a relatively low spin Hall angles around 0.01~0.02 due to the large longitudinal conductivity. For L10-MnAl(101), the non-relativistic spin Hall conductivity can reach up to 10000\frac{\hbar}{2e} \left( \Omega \, \text{cm} \right)^{-1}, with a giant spin Hall angle around 0.25 at room temperature. By analyzing the magnetization switching process, we demonstrate deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization without an external magnetic field by using 3d ferromagnetic metals as spin current sources. Our work may provide an unambiguous understanding on spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals and pave the way for their potential applications in related spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Genuine and Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling Effect in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Yan, Xujin Zhang, Jianhua Xiao, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu</p>
            <p>Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However, existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr$_3$/MnPSe$_3$/CrBr$_3$ vertical heterostructure, enabling genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, the highest value reported to date. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Longitudinal Spin Hall Magnetoresistance from Spin Fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ping Tang</p>
            <p>Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), the variation in resistance in a heavy metal (HM) with the magnetization orientation of an adjacent ferromagnet (FM), has been extensively studied as a powerful tool for probing surface magnetic moments in a variety of magnetic materials. However, the conventional SMR theory assumes rigid magnetization of a fixed magnitude, an assumption that breaks down close to the FM's Curie temperature \(T_c\), where the magnetic susceptibility diverges. Here, we report an unconventional SMR effect arising from the magnetic-field modulation of spin fluctuations in the FM, while its magnetization remaining collinear to the spin Hall accumulation in the HM. In contrast to the conventional SMR, which scales with the magnetization and vanishes near $T_{c}$, such ``longitudinal" SMR (LSMR), though suppressed at low temperatures, becomes critically enhanced at \(T_c\), reaching a magnitude comparable to conventional SMR amplitudes. Our findings suggest a promising method for electrically detecting enhanced spin fluctuations in magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Chiral induced Spin Polarized Electron Current: Origin of the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Fransson</p>
            <p>The discovery of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect has provided a novel tool to study how active physical and chemical mechanism may differ in chiral enantiomers, however, the origin of the effect itself is yet an open question. In this article, it is theoretically shown that two aspects have to be fulfilled for the chiral induced spin selectivity effect to arise. First, chirality is a necessary condition for breaking spin-degeneracy in molecular structures that do not comprise heavy elements. Second, dissipation is indispensable for the molecule to develop a non-vanishing spin-polarization. These theoretical conclusions are illustrated in terms of a few examples, showing the necessity of the two aspects to be coordinated for the emergence of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect.</p>

            <h2>Current-induced re-entrant superconductivity and extreme nonreciprocal superconducting diode effect in valley-polarized systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Chen Zhuang, Qing-Feng Sun</p>
            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to the nonreciprocity of superconducting critical currents for the metal-superconductor transition. Generally, the SDE has a positive and a negative critical current $j_{c\pm}$ corresponding to two opposite directions whose amplitudes are unequal. It is demonstrated that an extreme nonreciprocity where two critical currents can become both positive (or negative) has been observed in a recent experiment. In this work, we theoretically propose a possible mechanism to realize an extreme nonreciprocal SDE. Based on a microscopic theory and a simple valley-polarized model, we demonstrate that depairing currents required to dissolve Cooper pairs can be remodulated under the interplay between the valley polarization and the applied current. Near the disappearance of the superconductivity, the remodulation is shown to induce the extreme nonreciprocity and also the current-induced re-entrant superconductivity where the system has two different critical current intervals. Our study may provide new horizons for understanding the coexistence of superconductivity and spontaneous ferromagnetism and pave a new way to designing the SDE with 100% efficiency.</p>

            <p>The Landauer-Büttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</p>

            <h2>Robustness of quantum many-body scars in the presence of Markovian bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang-Ping Jiang, Mingdi Xu, Xuanpu Yang, Yucheng Wang, Lei Pan</p>
            <p>A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization. It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent dynamics.</p>

            <p>Atomic migration from metallic contacts, and subsequent filament formation, is recognised as a prevailing mechanism leading to resistive switching in memristors based on two-dimensional materials (2DMs). This study presents a detailed atomistic examination of the migration of different metal atoms across the grain boundaries (GBs) of 2DMs, employing Density Functional Theory in conjunction with Non-Equilibrium Green's Function transport simulations. Various types of metallic atoms, Au, Cu, Al, Ni, and Ag, are examined, focusing on their migration both in the out-of-plane direction through a MoS\textsubscript{2} layer and along the surface of the MoS\textsubscript{2} layer, pertinent to filament formation in vertical and lateral memristors, respectively. Different types of GBs usually present in MoS\textsubscript{2} are considered to assess their influence on the diffusion of metal atoms. The findings are compared with structures based on pristine MoS\textsubscript{2} and those with mono-sulfur vacancies, aiming to understand the key elements that affect the switching performance of memristors. Furthermore, transport simulations are carried out to evaluate the effects of GBs on both out-of-plane and in-plane electron conductance, providing valuable insights into the resistive switching ratio.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafna Rafeek, Debasish Mondal</p>
            <p>The information engine extracts work from a single heat bath using mutual information obtained during the operation cycle. This study investigates the influence of the potential shaping in a Brownian information engine (BIE) in harnessing the information from thermal fluctuations. We have designed a BIE by considering an overdamped Brownian particle inside a confined potential and introducing an appropriate symmetric feedback cycle. We find that the upper bound of the extractable work for a BIE with a monostable centrosymmetric confining potential, with a stable state at the potential centre, depends on the bath temperature and the convexity of the confinement. A concave confinement is more efficient for an information-energy exchange. For a bistable confinement with an unstable centre and two symmetric stable basins, one can find an engine-to-refrigeration transition beyond a certain barrier height related to the energy difference between the energy barrier and the stable basins. Finally, we use the concavity-induced gain in information harnessing to device a BIE in the presence of a multistable potential that can harvest even more energy than monostable confinement.</p>

            <p>Anisotropic materials with low symmetries hold significant promise for next-generation electronic and quantum devices. 2M-WS2, a candidate for topological superconductivity, has garnered considerable interest. However, a comprehensive understanding of how its anisotropic features contribute to unconventional superconductivity, along with a simple, reliable method to identify its crystal orientation, remains elusive. Here, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to investigate angle- and polarization-dependent anisotropic Raman modes of 2M-WS2. Through first-principles calculations, we predict and analyze phonon dispersion and lattice vibrations of all Raman modes in 2M-WS2. We establish a direct correlation between their anisotropic Raman spectra and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Finally, we demonstrate that anisotropic Raman spectroscopy can accurately determine the crystal orientation and twist angle between two stacked 2M-WS2 layers. Our findings provide insights into the electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic properties of 2M-WS2, paving the way for the use of anisotropic materials in advanced electronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarah I. Allec, Maxim Ziatdinov</p>
            <p>Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriy V. Ginzburg, Oleg V. Gendelman, Riccardo Casalini, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>In an earlier preprint (V. V. Ginzburg, O. V. Gendelman, R. Casalini, and A. Zaccone, arXiv:2409.17291), we demonstrated that the dynamic (relaxation time) and volume equations of state for many amorphous polymers are near-universal -- each material is characterized by two governing parameters -- the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, and the elementary relaxation time, /tau_{el}. The dynamic fragility, m, is uniquely related to /tau_{el}. The earlier analysis was based on the data for high polymers (degree of polymerization, N > 200, and molecular weight, Mw > 20,000 g/mol). Here, we investigate the dependence of T_{g} and /tau_{el} on N (or, equivalently, on the molecular weight, M). We consider the dielectric spectroscopy data for homologous series of four polymers: polystyrene (PS), poly-(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP), poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), and polybutadiene (PB). It is shown that the relaxation time curves for various oligomers can be successfully collapsed onto the same master curve as the high polymers. The glass transition temperature and the dynamic fragility are found to be linear functions of 1/M, in agreement with the Fox-Flory equation. The scaling results are interpreted based on the SL-TS2 theory, ensuring that the model description is consistent with the Boyer rules for the coefficients of thermal expansion above and below T_{g}, as well as the thermodynamical scaling for the pressure dependence of the relaxation time.</p>

            <p>We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a non-trivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a non-trivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topologically quantized jump and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the non-interacting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order nonlinear optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced steady dc currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.</p>

            <p>We report on magnetic anisotropy modulation in Bismuth substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet (Bi-YIG) thin films and mesoscale patterned structures deposited on a PMN-PT substrate with the application of voltage-induced strain. The Bi content is selected for low coercivity and higher magnetostriction than that of YIG, yielding significant changes in the hysteresis loops through the magnetoelastic effect. The piezoelectric substrate is poled along its thickness, which is the [011] direction, by applying a voltage across the PMN-PT/SiO2/Bi-YIG/Pt heterostructure. In-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy (MOKE) shows the modulation of magnetic anisotropy with voltage-induced strain. Furthermore, voltage control of the magnetic domain state of the Bi-YIG film at a fixed magnetic field produces a 90° switching of the magnetization easy axis above a threshold voltage. The magnetoelectric coefficient of the heterostructure is 1.05x10^(-7)s/m which is competitive with that of other ferromagnetic oxide films on ferroelectric substrates such as La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/PMNPT and YIG/PMN-PZT. Voltage-control of magnetization reversal fields in 5-30 microns wide dots and racetracks of Bi-YIG show potential for energy efficient non-volatile memory and neuromorphic computing devices.</p>

In this work, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$, a metal that features a niobium-based kagome lattice and a frustrated triangular gadolinium network. The compound adopts the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type crystal structure, with lattice parameters of a = b = 5.765(4) Å and c = 9.536(8) Å. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements reveal a magnetic transition near 2.3 K. Electrical transport data confirm metallic behavior, unsaturated positive magnetoresistance, and a hole-dominated multiband Hall effect. Furthermore, first-principles calculations indicate that Nb-4d orbitals predominantly contribute to the electronic states near the Fermi energy, with the band structure showing multiple topologically nontrivial crossings around the Fermi surface. This study also compares GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$ with GdV$_6$Sn$_6$, highlighting their similarities and differences.

            <p>Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is a fundamental challenge in physics, particularly for non-equilibrium and non-stationary processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a complete framework for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds are recently reported for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present an exact response equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose system response into spatial correlations of local dynamical events. This decomposition reveals that response properties are encoded in correlations between transitions and dwelling times across the network, providing a natural generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to generic non-equilibrium processes. Our theory unifies existing response bounds, extends them to time-dependent processes, and reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of the tightness of multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical significance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of response properties from unperturbed trajectory data, offering practical advantages for studying complex networks and biological systems far from equilibrium.</p>

            <p>Kibble-Zurek scaling is the scaling of the density of the topological defects formed via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with respect to the rate at which a system is cooled across a continuous phase transition. Recently, the density of the topological defects formed via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism was computed for a system cooled through a first-order phase transition instead of the usual continuous transitions. Here we address the problem of whether such defects generated across a first-order phase transition exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling similar to the case in continuous phase transitions. We show that any possible Kibble-Zurek scaling for the topological defects can only be a very rough approximation due to an intrinsic field for the scaling. However, complete universal scaling for other properties does exist.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Excitonic Effects in 2D Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahsan Javed, Sajid Ali</p>
            <p>Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.</p>

            <h2>Tensor network method for solving the Ising model with a magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Myung-Hoon Chung</p>
            <p>We study the two-dimensional square lattice Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet with a magnetic field by using tensor network method. Focusing on the role of guage fixing, we present the partition function in terms of a tensor network. The tensor has a different symmetry property for ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. The tensor network of the partition function is interpreted as a multiple product of the one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian. We perform infinite density matrix renormalization group to contract the two-dimensional tensor network. We present the numerical result of magnetization and entanglement entropy for the Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet side by side. In order to determine the critical line in the parameter space of temperature and magnetic field, we use the half-chain entanglement entropy of the one-dimensional quantum state. The entanglement entropy precisely indicates the critical line forming the parabolic shape for the antiferromagnetic case, but shows the critical point for the ferromagnetic case.</p>

            <h2>On Computational Complexity of 3D Ising Spin Glass: Lessons from D-Wave Annealer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Zhang, Alex Kamenev</p>
            <p>Finding an exact ground state of a 3D Ising spin glass is proven to be an NP-hard problem. There is a widespread belief that this statement implies an exponential scaling, $\sim 2^{N/\beta}$, of necessary computational efforts (classical or quantum), with the number of spins, $N$. Yet, what is a factor $\beta$ here and are there any fundamental limits on how large it can be? Here we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\leq 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, characterized by $\beta\approx 10^{3}$. We argue that with a further improvement of annealing protocols, post-processing algorithms and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further. We provide a theoretical argumentation for this observation based on statistical analysis of low energy states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Song Li, Pei Li, Adam Gali</p>
            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.</p>

            <p>While stochastic resetting (or total resetting) is less young and more established concept in stochastic processes, partial stochastic resetting (PSR) is a relatively new field. PSR means that, at random moments in time, a stochastic process gets multiplied by a factor between 0 and 1, thus approaching but not reaching the resetting position. In this paper, we present new results on PSR highlighting the main similarities and discrepancies with total resetting. Specifically, we consider both symmetric $\alpha$-stable Lévy processes (Lévy flights) and Brownian motion with PSR in arbitrary d dimensions. We derive explicit expressions for the propagator and its stationary measure, and discuss in detail their asymptotic behavior. Interestingly, while approaching to stationarity, a dynamical phase transition occurs for the Brownian motion, but not for Lévy flights. We also analyze the behavior of the process around the resetting position and find significant differences between PSR and total resetting.</p>

            <p>We investigate how spatiotemporal spin polarized current can lead to terahertz frequency excitations in non-collinear antiferromagnets. By solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically for non-collinear antiferromagnet, we show that the magnon frequency spectrum exhibits standing spin wave modes and depends on the thickness of Mn$_3$Ge in heterostructure Fe|Au|Mn$_3$Ge. Also, we analyze the switching process of ground state as a function of a spin current. We show a switching phase diagram, which contains switching and non-switching regions. Our work suggests non-collinear antiferromagnets as an efficient platform for terahertz magnonics and ultrafast memory devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Wang, Ruicheng Bao, Naruo Ohga</p>
            <p>Time-delayed effects are widely present in nature, often accompanied by distinctive nonequilibrium features such as negative apparent heat dissipation. To elucidate detailed structures of the dissipation, we study the frequency decompositions of the heat dissipation in linear time-delayed Langevin systems. We analytically solve Langevin equations with a single linear time-delayed feedback force and calculate the spectrum of the heat dissipation in the frequency domain using the Harada-Sasa equality, which relates the heat dissipation to the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR). We find a characteristic oscillatory behavior in the spectrum, which asymptotically oscillates sinusoidally with a decaying envelope proportional to the strength of the time-delayed force and the inverse of the frequency. We confirm the generality of the results by extending our analysis to systems with multiple delay times and continuously distributed delay times. Since the violation of FDR is experimentally accessible, our results suggest an experimental direction for detecting and analyzing detailed characteristics of dissipation in time-delayed systems.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting Impurity Induced In-gap Bound States In Unconventional Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junkang Huang, Z. D. Wang, Tao Zhou</p>
            <p>This study revisits the effects of single impurity scattering in unconventional superconductors, with a specific emphasis on intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. We reveal that in the context of a square lattice near half-filling doping, there exists an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the appearance of mid-gap states. This relationship is determined by the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of both the $d$-wave gap amplitude and the square lattice itself. Furthermore, we identify an intrinsic link between the in-gap states and the sign change of the order parameter. In systems with interlayer pairing, strong resonant peaks are observed, despite the absence of sign-reversal characteristics in the pairing order parameter. By utilizing the $T$-matrix approach, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying these impurity-induced states. Our theoretical framework is pertinent to the analysis of newly discovered nickel-based high-temperature superconductors, providing a powerful tool for distinguishing their pairing properties. The results of this study shed light on the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity effects in unconventional superconductors, paving the way for future investigations into the unique properties of these emerging materials.</p>

            <p>While either spin or point-group adaptation is straightforward when considered independently, the standard technique for factoring isotropic spin Hamiltonians by the total spin S and the irreducible representation of the point-group is limited by the complexity of transformations between different coupling-schemes that are related by site-permutations. To overcome these challenges, we apply projection-operators directly to uncoupled basis-states, enabling the simultaneous treatment of spin and point-group symmetry without the need for recoupling-transformations. This provides a simple and efficient approach for the exact diagonalization of isotropic spin-models that we illustrate with applications to Heisenberg spin-rings and polyhedra, including systems that are computationally inaccessible with conventional coupling-techniques.</p>

            <p>Spin coupling between magnetic metal atoms and organic radicals plays a pivotal role in high-performance magnetic materials. The complex interaction involving multi-spin centers in bulk materials makes it challenging to study spin coupling at the atomic scale. Here, we investigate the $d$-$\pi$-$d$ spin interaction in well-defined metal-organic coordinated structures composed of two iron (Fe) atoms and four all-trans retinoic acid (ReA) molecules, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The ReA molecule is turned into a spin-$1/2$ radical state by dehydrogenation, facilitating strong magnetic coupling with the coordinated Fe atoms. Comprehensive theoretical analysis, based on density functional theory and valence bond theory, further elucidates the intrinsic mechanism of ferrimagnetic spin coupling in the coordination structure. Specifically, simultaneous antiferromagnetic coupling of Fe dimer to ReA radicals parallelizes the dimer spin orientation. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of spin interaction in metal-organic coordination structures and provides microscopic insights for designing advanced magnetic materials.</p>

Specifically, we study a magnonic waveguide formed within a uniform ferromagnetic layer (Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$) through surface anisotropy applied in stripe regions, creating Bragg mirror structures. The proposed waveguide enables the propagation of high-frequency spin waves with high velocities in the ferromagnetic layer while avoiding static demagnetizing effects. Using finite element simulations, we calculate the dispersion relation of the waveguide modes and analyze their spatial profiles. Additionally, we evaluate the group velocity and localization characteristics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the waveguide's performance.</p>

            <h2>On modeling global grain boundary energy functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Morawiec</p>
            <p>Grain boundaries affect properties of polycrystalline materials. The influence of a boundary is largely determined by its energy. Grain boundary energy is often portrayed as a function of macroscopic boundary parameters representing grain misorientation and boundary plane inclination. In grain boundary simulation and modeling, many studies neglect structural multiplicity of boundaries, i.e., existence of metastable states, and focus on minimum energy. The minimum energy function restricted to constant misorientation should satisfy Herring's condition for interface stability. This requirement has been ignored in recent works on grain boundary energy functions. Example violations of the stability condition are shown. Moreover, a simple and natural procedure for constructing a continuous function satisfying the condition is described. Cusps in the energy as a function of boundary plane inclinations arise because of the imposition of the stability condition, and their locations and shapes result from properties of input data. An example of applying the procedure to simulated data is presented.</p>

GdRu2Si2 is one such candidate material which has been shown to host a variety of multi-Q magnetic structures, including in zero-field. Here, inelastic neutron scattering is used to measure the spin excitations in the field-polarized phase of GdRu2Si2. Linear spin wave theory and a method of interaction invariant path analysis are used to derive a Hamiltonian accounting for the observed spectra, and comparisons to \textit{ab initio} calculations are made. No evidence for anisotropic or higher order-exchange terms beyond bilinear Heisenberg exchange is found. This is discussed in the context of the multi-Q states existing at lower fields, for which these types of terms have previously been conceived to be significant in the formation of multi-Q ground states.</p>

Moreover, it has recently been shown that the MARTINI force-field coarse-graining approach is applicable in MDPD, thus rendering feasible the simulation of complex systems as in MD MARTINI for ever larger systems for longer physical times. Here, simulations of various lipid membranes were performed by using the MDPD-MARTINI coarse-grained (CG) force-field, relevant properties were calculated, and comparison with standard MD MARTINI CG simulations and experimental data was made. Thus insights into structural properties of these bilayer systems and further evidence regarding the transferability of the MDPD-MARTINI models are provided. In this regard, this is a natural next step in the development of the general-purpose MDPD-MARTINI CG force-field, which generally provides significant speed-ups in both computational and physical simulated times, in comparison with standard CG MD simulations.</p>

The hierarchical architecture of these structures provides diatoms with mechanical protection and the ability to filter, float, and manipulate light.

In this paper, we use numerical simulations, analytical models, and experimental tests to unveil the structural and fluid dynamic efficiency of the Coscinodiscus species diatom. Then we propose a novel 3D printable multifunctional biomimetic material for applications such as porous filters, heat exchangers, drug delivery systems, lightweight structures, and robotics. Our results demonstrate the role of Nature as a material designer for efficient and tunable systems and highlight the potential of diatoms for engineering materials innovation.

            <h2>Self-diffusive dynamics of active Brownian particles at moderate densities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo Soto</p>
            <p>The Active Brownian Particle (ABP) model has become a prototype of self-propelled particles. ABPs move persistently at a constant speed $V$ along a direction that changes slowly by rotational diffusion, characterized by a coefficient $\Dr$. Persistent motion plus random reorientations generate a random walk at long times with a diffusion coefficient that, for isolated ABPs in two dimensions, is given by $D_0=V^2/(2\Dr)$. Here we study the density effects on the self-diffusive dynamics using a recently proposed kinetic theory for ABPs, in which persistent collisions are described as producing a net displacement on the particles. On intermediate timescales, where many collisions have taken place but the director of the tagged particle has not yet changed, an effective stochastic dynamics emerges, characterized by an effective reduced streaming velocity $V_\text{eff}$ and anisotropic diffusion, with coefficients explicitly depending on density. Based on this result, an effective theoretical and numerical approach is proposed in which the particles follow stochastic dynamics with mean-field interactions based on the local density. Finally, on time scales larger than $\Dr^{-1}$, the tagged particle shows an effective diffusive motion with a coefficient $D=V_\text{eff}^2/(2\Dr)$. The dependence of $V_\text{eff}$ on density indicates that the kinetic theory is limited to are fractions smaller than 0.42, and beyond this limit unphysical results appear.</p>

            <p>The world of nanoscales in fluidics is the frontier where the continuum of fluid mechanics meets the atomic, and even quantum, nature of matter. While water dynamics remains largely classical under extreme confinement, several experiments have recently reported coupling between water transport and the electronic degrees of freedom of the confining materials. This avenue prompts us to reconsider nanoscale hydrodynamic flows under the perspective of interacting excitations, akin to condensed matter frameworks. Here we show, using a combination of many-body theory and molecular simulations, that the flow of a liquid can induce the flow of another liquid behind a separating wall, at odds with the prediction of continuum hydrodynamics. We further show that the range of this 'flow tunnelling' can be tuned through the solid's electronic excitations, with a maximum occurring when these are at resonance with the liquid's charge density fluctuations. Flow tunnelling is expected to play a role in global transport across nanoscale fluidic networks, such as lamellar graphene oxide or MXene membranes. It further suggests exploiting the electronic properties of the confining walls for manipulating liquids via their dielectric spectra, beyond the nature and characteristics of individual molecules.</p>

In the latter case, we observe that the Andreev bound states forming on the QD are inverted if the junction has $p$-wave symmetry, meaning that electron and hole orbitals switch roles. We calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients both analytically and numerically and show how the induced gaps and the band inversion are reflected in the electrical and heat conductance as well as the Seebeck coefficient, the latter experiencing a sign change in the topological case.</p>

            <p>Launching and focusing phonon-polaritons present novel opportunities for low-loss guiding of subdiffractionally confined light at the nanoscale. Despite significant efforts to improve control in polaritonic media, focused and spatially confined phonon-polariton waves have only been achieved in the in-plane anisotropic crystals (such as MoO$_3$) and remain elusive in the in-plane isotropic crystals (such as hexagonal boron nitride). In this study, we present a previously unexplored approach to launching phonon-polaritons by employing hBN subwavelength resonators coupled to gold nanoantennas. The integration of gold nanoantennas enables efficient coupling to the far-field component of mid-infrared light, while the geometry of the resonators defines the wavefront curvature, spatial confinement, and focusing of the launched polaritons. Using standard lithographic protocols, we achieve strong field enhancement and resonant mode localization, generating phonon-polaritons with precise spatial definition. Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy reveals the real-space optical contrast of these modes. This innovative and practical approach introduces a new paradigm for fabricating nanoresonators that actively launch and focus phonon-polaritons, opening avenues for advanced nanophotonic devices.</p>

We show that the emergent polarity is linearly unstable to perturbations for a specific sign of the active stress recalling instabilities of orientational order in a fluid. Using numerical simulations, we find however that non-reciprocity stabilizes the waves against the linear instability in a large region of the phase space.</p>

            <p>We consider a proximity effect between Dirac surface states of a topological insulator and the skyrmion phase of an insulating magnet. A single skyrmion results in the surface states having a chiral gapless mode confined to the perimeter of the skyrmion. For the lattice of skyrmions, the tunneling coupling between confined states leads to the formation of low energy bands delocalized across the whole system. We show that the structure of these bands can be investigated with the help of the phenomenological chiral network model with a kagome lattice geometry. While the network model by itself can be in a chiral Floquet phase unattainable without external periodic driving, we show how to use a procedure known as band reconstruction to obtain the low energy bands of the electrons on the surface of the topological insulator for which there is no external driving. We conclude that band reconstruction is essential for the broad class of network models recently introduced to describe the electronic properties of different nanostructures.</p>

Asymptotic solutions of $\lambda$ and $\lambda_t$ for $\Lambda\ll 1$ and $\Lambda \gg 1$ are derived and summarized for different surface structures, interface shapes and $\Lambda$, which reveal a different trend for $\lambda$ and $\Lambda \ll 1$ and the presence of a meniscus. In the context of constant-pressure CCM, our results indicate that transverse-grooves surfaces consistently reduced the heat transfer. However, longitudinal grooves can enhance heat transfer under the effects of confinement and meniscus when $\Lambda \lessapprox 0.1$ and $\phi < 1 - 0.5^{2/3} \approx 0.37$. For gravity-driven CCM, the parameters of $l$ and $\phi$ determine whether the melting rate is enhanced, reduced, or nearly unaffected. We construct a phase diagram based on the parameter matrix $(\log_{10} l, \phi)$to delineate these three regimes. Lastly, we derived two asymptotic solutions for predicting the variation in time of the unmelted solid height.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic frustration and weak Mn magnetic ordering in EuMn$_2$P$_2$</h2>

            <p>We report on the electron spin resonance (ESR), heat capacity, magnetization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic circular and linear dichroism (XMCD, XMLD), as well as the electrical resistivity of EuMn$_{2}$P$_{2}$ single crystals. Antiferromagnetic order of Eu was observed in several quantities at $T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}\,=\,18\,\rm K$. The temperature dependencies of ESR linewidth and resonance shift show, when approaching the Eu-ordered state, a divergence towards $T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}$, indicating the growing importance of magnetic correlations and the build-up of internal magnetic fields. An additional temperature scale of $\approx 47\,\rm K$ has considerable impact on linewidth, resonance field and intensity. This points to the presence of weak Mn-based ordering. The observed ESR line is interpreted as an Eu$^{2+}$ resonance, which probes the weak magnetic background of the Mn subsystem. Such picture is suggested by the lineshape which keeps to be Lorentzian across the $47\,\rm K$ scale and by the ESR intensity which can be described by the same Curie-Weiss temperature above and below $47\,\rm K$. In the same temperature range anomalies were observed at $48.5\,\rm K$ and $51\,\rm K$ in the heat capacity data as well as a pronounced broadening of the NMR signal of the EuMn$_{2}$P$_{2}$ samples. In XMCD and XMLD measurements, this weak magnetic order could not be detected in the same temperature range which might be due to the small magnetic moment, with a potential $c$-component or frustration.</p>

            <h2>Three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall effect in Weyl semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Qiang Zhang, Yu-Hang Li, Ming Lu, Hongfang Liu, Hailong Li, Hua Jiang, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</p>

            <h2>Sample shape dependence of magnetic noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven T. Bramwell</p>
            <p>Zero-field magnetic noise, characterised by the magnetic autocorrelation function $S_s(t)$, has been observed, perhaps surprisingly, to depend on sample shape $s$. The reasons for this are identified and general expressions are derived that relate the autocorrelation functions for systems of different shape to an underlying `intrinsic' form. Assuming the flcutuatiopn-dissipation theorem, it is shown that, for any noise that relaxes monotonically, the effect of sample shape is to reduce both the noise amplitude and mean relaxation time by a factor of $1+N\chi_i$, where $N$ is the demagnetizing factor and $\chi_i$ the intrinsic susceptibility. In frequency space, where $S_s(t)$ Fourier transforms into the power spectrum $S_s(\omega)$, the above two factors combine to suppress the zero frequency amplitude of $S_s(\omega)$ by $(1+N\chi_i)^2$, while at high frequency, sample shape dependence becomes negligible. These results suggest simple and robust experimental tests of the fluctuation--dissipation theorem in magnetic systems that may be useful in distinguishing bulk from surface effects.</p>

            <h2>Strain-Induced Activation of Symmetry-Forbidden Exciton-Phonon Couplings for Enhanced Phonon-Assisted Photoluminescence in MoS$_2$ Monolayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Saraswat, Rekha Verma, Sitangshu Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>Phonon-assisted photoluminescence (PL) in molybdenum-based two-dimensional dichalcogenides is typically weak due to the dormant phonon coupling with optically inactive momentum-dark (intervalley) excitons, unlike in tungsten-based dichalcogenides where such processes are more prominent. Despite this inefficiency, we revisit excitons in MoS$_2$ using rigorous finite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations to identify ways to enhance phonon-assisted recombination channels. Our ab-initio results, complemented by group-theoretic analyses, reveal that while unstrained MoS$_2$ exhibits no phonon-assisted PL emissions at cryogenic temperatures due to forbidden A$^{\prime\prime}$ phonon modes, biaxial strain opens a pathway to significantly intensify this emission by activating hole-phonon A$^{\prime}$-mediated scattering channels. By calculating allowed exciton-phonon matrix elements and scattering rates, we demonstrate how strain redistributes oscillator strengths toward radiative recombination. These findings provide a promising route to improving PL emission efficiency in various metal dichalcogenide monolayers through strain engineering and offer valuable insights for further exploration of exciton-phonon dynamics, including time-resolved spectroscopic studies.</p>

            <p>We study the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cSYK) numerically and investigate thermodynamic behavior of cSYK model across varying chemical potentials. We discover that the cSYK model remarkably mirrors the first-order phase transition seen in the van der Waals-Maxwell system, culminating at a non-mean-field critical point with distinctively different critical exponents. We analyze in detail the similarity between the van der Waals phase transition and the cSYK model, and further explore the mechanism by which the chemical potential drives the phase transition in the system. Exact diagonalization for the cSYK model reveals the significant impact of chemical potential on energy distribution, with observable energy gaps in the gapped phase. Quantum chaos indicators, including spectral form factors, suggest more stable energy states in the neutral case. Real-time dynamics, analyzed via analytical continuation of Schwinger-Dyson equations, show rapid decay in the gapless phase and prolonged oscillation lifetimes in the gapped regime. Spectral functions imply a shift from a continuous to a discrete energy level distribution, emphasizing the critical role of chemical potential in shaping spectral properties.</p>

            <p>Studying the typical entanglement entropy of a bipartite system when averaging over different ensembles of pure quantum states has been instrumental in different areas of physics, ranging from many-body quantum chaos to black hole evaporation. We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information. Those results are given for finite system size as well as in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <h2>On-the-Fly Path Planning of Compositional Gradients in High Dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Price, Zhaoxi Cao, Ian McCue</p>
            <p>Functional gradients have recently experienced an explosion in activity due to advances in manufacturing, where compositions can now be spatially varied on-the-fly during fabrication. In addition, modern computational thermodynamics has reached sufficient maturity -- with respect to property databases and the availability of commercial software -- that gradients can be designed with specific sets of properties. Despite these successes, there are practical limitations on the calculation speeds of these thermodynamic tools that make it intractable to model every element in an alloy. As a result, most path planning is carried out via surrogate models on simplified systems (e.g., approximating Inconel 718 as Ni$_{59}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$ instead of Ni$_{53}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$Nb$_{3}$Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{1}$). In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome using a combination of on-the-fly sampling and a conjectured corollary of the lever rule for transformations of isothermal paths in arbitrary compositional dimensions. We quantitatively benchmark the effectiveness of this new method and find that it can be as much as 106 times more efficient than surrogate modeling.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear topological pumping of edge solitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinrui You, Liaoyuan Xiao, Yongguan Ke, Chaohong Lee</p>
            <p>We study how nonlinear strength affects topological pumping of edge solitons by using nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For weak nonlinear strength, the introduction of nonlinearity breaks the symmetry of the energy spectrum, which makes the topological pumping from the left edge to the right edges differ from the inverse process. For moderate nonlinear strength, self-crossing structures appear in the spectrum, the right-to-left adiabatic pumping channel is destroyed, and only left-to-right topological pumping can be achieved under slow modulation. As the nonlinear strength further inreases, although left-to-right topological pumping in one pumping cycle also breaks down, we find that a thin soliton which is located in a single left edge can be mixed with the bulk soliton, and hybridized topological pumping of edge and bulk solitons can be realized after multiple pumping cycles. For stronger nonlinear strength, edge solitons are self-trapped and all topological pumping channels are shut down. Our work could trigger further studies of the interplay between nonlinearity and topology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin T. Grosvenor, Niels A. Obers, Subodh P. Patil</p>
            <p>We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.</p>

            <h2>Robust Dynamics of Rogue waves, Breathers and Mixed Bound State Solutions in Spin-Orbit and Rabi Coupled Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P.S.Vinayagam, R.Radha</p>
            <p>In this paper, based on an integrable model governed by four system parameters, namely, spin-orbit coupling and Rabi coupling which are constants while the other two parameters, namely the harmonic trap and scattering lengths which are time dependent, we investigate the spin orbit-Rabi coupled condensates governed by the two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equation. Employing Darboux transformation approach with nontrivial seed solution, we generate rogue waves, breathers, mixed rogue-dark-bright and classical dark-bright solitons. While the addition of SOC contributes to rapid oscillations in the amplitude of the rogue waves, Rabi coupling results in the appearance of stripes in the temporal direction. When the transient trap is switched on, these stripes which remain stable within the confining region, begin to overlap exponentially in the expulsive domain and eventually shrink leading to instability. We have shown that the instability arising in the rogue waves in a transient trap can be completely overcome by manipulating the scattering length through Feshbach resonance. In the case of breathers, the Rabi coupling introduces temporal stripes with single and double mode peaks around the origin while under the influence of the transient trap, the breathers get compressed and tilted. On the other hand, the amplitude of breathers which stays constant between a maxima and minima despite oscillating with time undergoes rapid fluctuations in a given spatial domain under the influence of SOC. In the case of classical dark-bright solitons, we see the flipping of dark solitons to attain positive density much similar to bright solitons under the impact of Rabi coupling. One also witnesses a 45 degree shift in the trajectory of dark and bright solitons when the transient trap is switched on. The width of the solitons widen in the confining trap while they shrink in the expulsive domain.</p>

            <p>Community detection, also known as graph partitioning, is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications in diverse fields such as complex network theory, transportation, and smart power grids. The problem's solution space grows drastically with the number of vertices and subgroups, making efficient algorithms crucial. In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a promising approach to tackling NP-hard problems. This study explores the use of a quantum-inspired algorithm, Simulated Bifurcation (SB), for community detection. Modularity is employed as both the objective function and a metric to evaluate the solutions. The community detection problem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling seamless integration with the SB algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that SB effectively identifies community structures in benchmark networks such as Zachary's Karate Club and the IEEE 33-bus system. Remarkably, SB achieved the highest modularity, matching the performance of Fujitsu's Digital Annealer, while surpassing results obtained from two quantum machines, D-Wave and IBM. These findings highlight the potential of Simulated Bifurcation as a powerful tool for solving community detection problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cameron Cook, Carlos Blanco, Juri Smirnov</p>
            <p>Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Poland, Gordon Rogelberg</p>
            <p>We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to transform the correlation function into a classical moment-generating function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 = \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into deformed higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit. We further compute tree-level perturbations on saddles in 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect correlators in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM, making predictions about deformations of families of long operators.</p>

            <p>In classical kinetic theory, the BBGKY hierarchy is an infinite chain of integro-differential equations that describes the full time-reversal-invariant (Liouville) system of interacting (quasi)-particles in terms of $N$-particle distribution functions. In this work, instead of truncating the hierarchy at the lowest level, as is done by the Boltzmann equation, we develop a scheme similar to the relaxation time approximation that is in principle able to account for the entire chain of equations. We then explicitly investigate its truncation at the second level of the BBGKY hierarchy and, within this scheme, study the spectra of conserved operator correlation functions in a gas of weakly confined hadrons. We also discuss how these higher levels account for parts of the operator spectra `deeper in the ultra-violet regime' and compare them to known results derived from the holographic duality.</p>

It consists of two ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers: one for sample preparation and the other for LEPD observations. The preparation chamber includes an Ar+ sputtering system, a triple-pocket electron beam evaporator, three gas introduction systems, additional user-configurable ports, and a LEED/Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) system. Sample manipulators enable rapid cooling, precise positioning, and orientation adjustments. In the preparation chamber, the manipulator also supports direct current heating up to 1200 °C.

In order to apply perturbation theory, we transform our Hamiltonian to polaron frame, so that the effective system-bath coupling gets reduced. We employ coherence defined by l1-norm to analyze the non-Markovian effects in the spin-boson model. In the transformed frame of reference, the correlation timescales for the bath are significantly shorter than the system's relaxation timescale-a key assumption for Markovian dynamics. However, intriguingly, we demonstrate that under the large polaron theory, the reduced dynamics exhibit effective non-Markovian behaviour within a specific range of couplings, while remaining Markovian beyond this range.</p>

Within the polaron perspective using Ohmic bath spectral density with a Gaussian cutoff, we identify a fundamental timescale $s$ (equivalently a length scale $l$), dictating coherence decay. Utilizing a quantum master equation in the energy eigen basis while maintaining fixed particle number, we demonstrate that coherence persists for small $s$ values but diminishes for larger ones.

            <p>A general analytical approach to the study of electromagnetic resonances of metasurfaces consisting of meta-atoms with anisotropic electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities and irradiated with obliquely incident light is developed in the direct dipole-moment representation. The presented approach allows us to clearly trace and explain the features of the electromagnetic coupling between electric and magnetic dipole moments in the metasurface and to identify its role in the formation of optical resonances. For these purposes, the dependence of the dipole lattice sums on the angle of illumination is also presented. Expressions for the transmittance and reflectivity corresponding to the specular reflectance are presented with explicit inclusion of the dipole moments of particles in the array, which allows using these expressions for multipole analysis of purely numerical results concerning the optical response of metasurfaces. The developed analytical method is tested to characterize the spectral resonances of dielectric metasurfaces composed of rectangular silicon nanoprisms. In addition, we discuss the relationship and similarity between the results of coupled dipole and coupled dipole-quadrupole methods. Our analytical representation of electromagnetic dipole coupling is an insightful and fast method for the characterization of collective resonances in metasurfaces under illumination at oblique incidence. It could be especially useful for designing planar nanophotonic devices consisting of arbitrary-shaped building blocks and operating under special irradiation conditions.</p>

Our study supplements recent investigations of string breaking, traditionally studied within quantum chromodynamics (QCD), to quantum many-body systems. Two regimes are identified depending on the strength of the coupling with local vibrations. For weak coupling, the string breaking is slowed down as compared to the dynamics in an isolated Ising string. The strong coupling leads to complicated dynamics in which the domain wall character of excitation is dissolved among many coupled states.</p>

            <p>As quantum networks expand and are deployed outside research laboratories, a need arises to design and integrate compact control electronics for each memory node. It is essential to understand the performance requirements for such systems, especially concerning tolerable levels of noise, since these specifications dramatically affect a system's design complexity and cost. Here, using an approach that can be easily generalized across quantum-hardware platforms, we present a case study based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We model and experimentally verify the effects of phase noise and timing jitter in the control system in conjunction with the spin qubit's environmental noise. We further consider the impact of different phase noise characteristics on the fidelity of dynamical decoupling sequences. The results demonstrate a procedure to specify design requirements for integrated quantum control signal generators for solid-state spin qubits, depending on their coherence time, intrinsic noise spectrum, and required fidelity.</p>

            <h2>Swimming mode determines how well mesoscale swimmers shield their odor in turbulence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin James, Francesco Viola, Agnese Seminara</p>
            <p>Marine organisms manipulate their surrounding flow through their swimming dynamics, which affects the transport of their own odor cues. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations how a group of mesoscale swimmers immersed in a turbulent flow alters the shape of the odor plume they release in the water. Odor mixing is enhanced by increased velocity fluctuations and a swimmer-induced flow circulation which widen the odor plume at close range while speeding up dilution of the chemical trace. Beyond a short-range increase in the likelihood of being detected, swimming considerably reduces detections with effects that can persist at distances of the order of ten times the size of the group or more. We find that puller-like swimmers are more effective at olfactory shielding than pusher-like swimmers. We trace this difference back to the dynamics at the swimmer location, which tends to trap odor at the source for pushers and to dilute it for pullers. Olfactory shielding is robust to changes in the conditions, and is more pronounced for weak turbulent Reynolds numbers and large swimmer Reynolds numbers. Our results suggest that olfactory shielding may play a role in the emergence of different swimming modalities by marine organisms.</p>

            <h2>Photon-photon coupling induced bound state in the continuum and transparency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ekta Tunwal, Kuldeep Kumar Shrivastava, Rakesh Kumar Nayak, Ravi Kumar, Somak Bhattacharyya, Rajeev Singh, Biswanath Bhoi</p>
            <p>This study presents the coherent and dissipative coupling realized in the hybrid photonic resonators that have been achieved via the constructive and destructive interference of the photonic resonator fields with the radiation of a common transmission line fed with microwave photons. In the dissipative coupling regime we have found the coexistence of a peculiar phenomenon bound state in the continuum (BIC) near the crossing of frequency of the uncoupled resonators by satisfying the Friedrich-Wintgen BICs condition. Again just by rotating one of the samples and with the dynamic adjustment of a parameter we have achieved coupling induced transparency between the photonic resonators. This transition from BIC in the absorption regime to transparency opens avenues for different sorts of plain or programmable oscillators, filters, quantum information processors, sensors etc.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of broken-symmetry approach to exchange interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naoya Iwahara, Zhishuo Huang, Akseli Mansikkamäki, Liviu F. Chibotaru</p>
            <p>Broken-symmetry (BS) approaches are widely employed to evaluate Heisenberg exchange parameters, primarily in combination with DFT calculations. For many magnetic materials, BS-DFT calculations give reasonable estimations of exchange parameters although systematic failures have also been reported. While the latter were attributed to deficiencies of approximate exchange-correlation functional, we prove here by treating a simple model system that the broken-symmetry methodology has serious problems. Detailed analysis clarifies the intrinsic issue with the broken-symmetry treatment of low-spin states. It shows, in particular, that the error in the BS calculation of exchange parameter scales with the degree of covalency between the magnetic and the bridging orbitals. As a possible tool to overcome this intrinsic drawback of single-determinant BS approaches, we propose their extension to a minimal multiconfigurational version.</p>

            <p>Developing neutron spectrometers with higher counting efficiency has been an essential pursuit in neutron instrumentation. In this work, we present BOYA, a multiplexing cold neutron spectrometers designed and implemented at the China Advanced Research Reactor. Equipped with 34 angular analyzing channels spanning 119°, each containing 5 inelastic channels and 1 diffraction channel, BOYA enhances the measurement efficiency by two orders of magnitude over a traditional triple-axis spectrometer. To optimize both intensity and energy resolution, innovative double-column Rowland focusing analyzers have been developed. By filling the crystal gaps in the traditional Rowland focusing geometry, our design enhances the neutron beam coverage without introducing appreciable double-scattering. Our commissioning results on vanadium and MnWO4 have confirmed the success of the design, establishing BOYA as a successful multiplexing instrument for neutron spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>Increasing the size and complexity of quantum information systems requires highly-multiplexed readout architectures, as well as amplifier chains operating near the quantum limit (QL) of added noise. While documented prior efforts in KITWPA integration in quantum systems are scarce, in this work we demonstrate integration of a KI-TWPA with a multiplexed-qubit device. To quantify the system noise improvement we perform an ac Stark shift calibration to precisely determine noise power levels on-chip (at each cavity's reference plane) and the total system gain. We then characterize the qubit state measurement fidelity and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To conduct the most faithful measurement of the benefits offered by the KI-TWPA we perform these measurements for readout chains where the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier is the first-stage amplifier (FSA) - with none of the external hardware required to operate the KI-TWPA - and with the KI-TWPA as the FSA. While some readout cavities fall outside the KI-TWPA bandwidth, for those inside the bandwidth we demonstrate a maximum improvement in the state measurement SNR by a factor of 1.45, and increase the fidelity from 96.2% to 97.8%. These measurements demonstrate a system noise below 5 quanta referenced on-chip and we bound the KI-TWPA excess noise to be below 4 quanta for the six cavities inside its bandwidth. These results show a promising path forward for realizing quantum-limited readout chains in large qubit systems using a single parametric amplifier.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Musenich, Lorenzo Strozzi, Massimiliano Avalle, Flavia Libonati</p>
            <p>The primary objective of helmet design continues to be the prevention of traumatic brain injuries. Yet, achieving an optimal user experience, including aspects such as fit, thermal comfort, breathability, waterproofing, and reusability, is increasingly significant. Thus, designing helmets with multifunctional performance represents the latest technological frontier for safety devices. This study draws inspiration from the morphology of Coscinodiscus species diatoms to develop a biomimetic material replicating their cellular structure and multifunctionality. Unlike its biological counterpart, the synthetic material is engineered as the inner liner for multi impact helmets, suited for urban sports and micro mobility applications. The architecture of the material is modeled using computer aided design tools, and its energy absorption capabilities are analyzed through finite element modeling and quasi static compression tests on 3D printed elastomeric samples. Performance optimization is achieved through a parametric approach. The results demonstrate that the material exhibits energy absorption comparable to cellular materials like honeycombs, while offering lightweight properties, breathability, and resistance to atmospheric agents. This biomimetic design marks a significant advancement in high performance safety equipment.</p>

            <h2>Modulational Instability and Dynamical Growth Blockade in the Nonlinear Hatano-Nelson Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>The Hatano-Nelson model is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian physics, describing asymmetric hopping dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice, which gives rise to fascinating phenomena such as directional transport, non-Hermitian topology, and the non-Hermitian skin effect. It has been widely studied in both classical and quantum systems, with applications in condensed matter physics, photonics, and cold atomic gases. Recently, nonlinear extensions of the Hatano-Nelson model have opened a new avenue for exploring the interplay between nonlinearity and non-Hermitian effects. Particularly, in lattices with open boundary conditions, nonlinear skin modes and solitons, localized at the edge or within the bulk of the lattice, have been predicted. In this work, we examine the nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and reveal a novel dynamical phenomenon arising from the modulational instability of nonlinear plane waves: growth blockade. This phenomenon is characterized by the abrupt halt of norm growth, as observed in the linear Hatano-Nelson model, and can be interpreted as a stopping of convective motion arising from self-induced disorder in the lattice.</p>

            <h2>Integrative Learning of Intensity Fluctuations of Quantum Dots under Excitation via a Tailored Mixture Hidden Markov Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Yang, Hawi Nyiera, Yonglei Sun, Jing Zhao, Kun Chen</p>
            <p>Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant interest in various scientific fields due to their unique fluorescence properties. One captivating characteristic of QDs is their ability to emit photons under continuous excitation. The intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different dots even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. As such, conventional approaches in the chemistry literature, typified by single-dot analysis of raw intensity data with Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM), cannot meet the many analytical challenges and may fail to capture any novel yet rare fluctuation patterns among QDs. Collaborating with scientists in the chemistry field, we have developed an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series of multiple QDs. Our approach still inherits the HMM as the skeleton to model the intensity fluctuations of each dot, and based on the data structure and the hypothesized collective behaviors of the QDs, our approach asserts that (i) under each hidden state, the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, (ii) the state distributions are shared across all the QDs, and (iii) the patterns of transitions can vary across QDs. These unique features allow for a precise characterization of the intensity fluctuation patterns and facilitate the clustering of the QDs. With experimental data collected on 128 QDs, our methods reveal several QD clusters characterized by unique transition patterns across three intensity states. The results provide deeper insight into QD behaviors and their design/application potentials.</p>

            <h2>Constructive impact of Wannier-Stark field on environment-boosted quantum batteries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Animesh Ghosh, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>Using the ground states of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model as the battery's initial state, we demonstrate that using the Wannier-Stark (WS) field for charging in addition to onsite interactions can increase the maximum power of the battery. Although the benefit is not ubiquitous, bosonic batteries are more affected by the WS field than fermionic ones. In particular, there exists a critical WS field strength above which the power gets increased in the battery. Further, we determine a closed form expression of the stored work when the battery is in the ground state of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model with only hopping term and the charging is carried out with onsite interactions and WS field irrespective of lattice-size of the battery. Moreover, we exhibit that it is possible to extract work in the fermionic batteries even without charging when the edge sites are attached to two local thermal baths having high temperatures -- this process we refer to as {\it environment-assisted ergotropy}. Note, however, that the bosonic batteries are able to exhibit such an environmental benefit in the transient regime when the lattice-size is increased and when Wannier-Stark field is present. Nonetheless, if the onsite interaction or WS potential with a critical strength is utilized as a charger, energy can be stored and extracted from both bosonic and fermionic batteries in the presence of the thermal baths.</p>

            <p>We develop a theoretical model for a tunable coherent terahertz radiation source based on the long-lived Bose condensate of photons. In the device we propose, the original photon pumping is performed incoherently by a blackbody radiation emitter. The photons thus produced Bose-condense by the inelastic relaxation on a two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetostatic field. The process involves neither population inversion nor light wave amplification the standard laser sources are built on. The coherence and tunability of the light emitted by such a photon condensate are provided and supported by the discrete spectrum of the electron gas in the quantizing magnetic field. The device is a compact-size semiconductor crystal. We propose the design and perform the realistic calculations of the physical properties and limiting factors for the terahertz photon Bose-condensate resonator. We show that our terahertz source can deliver the highly coherent light emission in the frequency range of 3-30 THz for the magnetic field induction of the order of 2 T, with the upper emission frequency limit adjustable by the strength of the magnetic field applied.</p>

            <p>The emergence of a quantum spin liquid (QSL), a state of matter that can result when electron spins are highly correlated but do not become ordered, has been the subject of a considerable body of research in condensed matter physics. Spin liquid states have been proposed as hosts for high-temperature superconductivity and can host topological properties with potential applications in quantum information science. The excitations of most quantum spin liquids are not conventional spin waves but rather quasiparticles known as spinons, whose existence is well established experimentally only in one-dimensional systems; the unambiguous experimental realization of QSL behavior in higher dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate the novel compound YbZn2GaO5, which hosts an ideal triangular lattice of effective spin-1/2 moments with no detectable inherent chemical disorder. Thermodynamic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements performed on high-quality single crystal samples of YbZn2GaO5 exclude the possibility of long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.06 K, demonstrate a quadratic power law for the specific heat and reveal a continuum of magnetic excitations in parts of the Brillouin zone. Both low-temperature thermodynamics and inelastic neutron scattering spectra suggest that YbZn2GaO5 is a U(1) Dirac QSL with spinon excitations concentrated at certain points in the Brillouin zone. We advanced these results by performing additional specific heat measurements under finite fields, further confirming the theoretical expectations for a Dirac QSL on the triangular lattice of YbZn2GaO5.</p>

            <h2>Evolution of entanglement entropy at SU($N$) deconfined quantum critical points</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Menghan Song, Jiarui Zhao, Meng Cheng, Cenke Xu, Michael M. Scherer, Lukas Janssen, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between Néel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</p>

            <p>We study the breakdown of Anderson localization in the one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon chain, a prototypical example of a disordered classical many-body system. A series of numerical works indicate that an initially localized wave packet spreads polynomially in time, while analytical studies rather suggest a much slower spreading. Here, we focus on the decorrelation time in equilibrium. On the one hand, we provide a mathematical theorem establishing that this time is larger than any inverse power law in the effective anharmonicity parameter $\lambda$, and on the other hand our numerics show that it follows a power law for a broad range of values of $\lambda$. This numerical behavior is fully consistent with the power law observed numerically in spreading experiments, and we conclude that the state-of-the-art numerics may well be unable to capture the long-time behavior of such classical disordered systems.</p>

            <p>We present a bunch of novel phenomena stemming from the pair spin-orbit interaction (PSOI), which does not rely on structure inversion asymmetry but instead arises from Coulomb fields of interacting electrons in materials with a strong Rashba effect. First, PSOI can induce $p-$wave superconducting order without the need for any mediators of attraction. Depending on the sign and strength of the PSOI coupling, two distinct superconducting phases emerge in 3D systems, analogous to the A and B phases observed in superfluid $^3\mathrm{He}$. In contrast, 2D systems exhibit $p^x\pm i p^y$ order parameter, leading to the time-reversal-invariant topological superconductivity. Second, a sufficiently strong PSOI can induce ferromagnetic ordering. It is associated with a deformation of the Fermi surface, which eventually leads to a Lifshitz transition from a spherical to a toroidal Fermi surface, with a number of experimentally observable signatures. Finally, in sufficiently clean Rashba materials, ferromagnetism and $p-$wave superconductivity may coexist. This state resembles the $\mathrm{A}_1$ phase of $^3\mathrm{He}$, yet it may avoid nodal points due to the toroidal shape of the Fermi surface.</p>

            <p>The parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov (N-U) method is employed in conjunction with a generalized fractional derivative (GFD) to investigate the energy eigenvalues and the total normalized wave function associated with the Coulomb plus screened exponential hyperbolic potential (CPSEHP) in terms of Jacobi polynomials. This potential exhibits maximum effectiveness at lower values of the screening parameter. To explore the thermal and superstatistical characteristics, the derived energy eigenvalues are directly incorporated into the partition function (Z) and subsequently used to determine other thermodynamic quantities, including vibrational mean energy (U), specific heat capacity (C), entropy (S), and free energy (F). Comparisons with previous studies are conducted. The classical case is recovered from the fractional case by setting alpha = beta = 1, consistent with prior work. Our results demonstrate that the fractional parameter plays a crucial role in governing the thermal and superstatistical properties within the framework of this model.</p>

            <h2>Derivation of an effective plate theory for parallelogram origami from bar and hinge elasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hu Xu, Ian Tobasco, Paul Plucinsky</p>
            <p>Periodic origami patterns made with repeating unit cells of creases and panels bend and twist in complex ways. In principle, such soft modes of deformation admit a simplified asymptotic description in the limit of a large number of cells. Starting from a bar and hinge model for the elastic energy of a generic four parallelogram panel origami pattern, we derive a complete set of geometric compatibility conditions identifying the pattern's soft modes in this limit. The compatibility equations form a system of partial differential equations constraining the actuation of the origami's creases (a scalar angle field) and the relative rotations of its unit cells (a pair of skew tensor fields). We show that every solution of the compatibility equations is the limit of a sequence of soft modes -- origami deformations with finite bending energy and negligible stretching. Using these sequences, we derive a plate-like theory for parallelogram origami patterns with an explicit coarse-grained quadratic energy depending on the gradient of the crease-actuation and the relative rotations of the cells. Finally, we illustrate our theory in the context of two well-known origami designs: the Miura and Eggbox patterns. Though these patterns are distinguished in their anticlastic and synclastic bending responses, they show a universal twisting response. General soft modes captured by our theory involve a rich nonlinear interplay between actuation, bending and twisting, determined by the underlying crease geometry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Zhou Qu, Dai-Wei Qu, Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Gang Su</p>
            <p>Understanding the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelate superconductors constitutes a fascinating quest. Using density matrix renormalization group for $T=0$ and thermal tensor networks for $T>0$ properties, along with density functional theory calculations, we investigate the intriguing interplay between the Hund's rule coupling and interorbital hybridization that explains the pressure-dependent high-$T_c$ superconductivity in bilayer nickelates. By studying a two-orbital model, we identify three distinct superconductive (SC) regimes: hybridization dominant, Hund's rule dominant, and the hybrid-Hund synergistic SC regimes. In these SC regimes, both $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit algebraic pairing correlations with similar Luttinger parameters $K_{\rm SC}$. In particular, the former always exhibits a much stronger amplitude than the latter, with a distinctly higher SC characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Below this temperature, the pairing susceptibility diverges as $\chi_{\rm SC}(T) \sim 1/T^{2-K_{\rm SC}}$. With realistic model parameters, we find the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ falls into the Hund's rule dominated SC regime. As hybridization further enhances under pressure, it leads to significant interorbital frustration and in turn suppresses the SC correlations, explaining the rise and fall of high-$T_c$ superconductivity under high pressure [J. Li, et al., arXiv:2404.11369 (2024)]. Our results offer a comprehensive understanding of the interlayer pairing in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

We benchmark our results for twisted bilayer graphene and twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Our \textit{single-parameter} theory is valid in graphene bilayers for twist angles $\theta ~\gtrsim 0.7^\circ$, and in twisted WSe$_2$ for $\theta ~\gtrsim 1.6^\circ$. We also investigate how relaxation alters the electronic structure in twisted bilayer graphene, providing a simple extension to the continuum model to account for lattice relaxation.</p>

            <p>The interplay of electronic interactions and frustration in crystalline systems leads to a panoply of correlated phases, including exotic Mott insulators with non-trivial patterns of entanglement. Disorder introduces additional quantum interference effects that can drive localization phenomena. Quasicrystals, which are neither disordered nor perfectly crystalline, are interesting playgrounds for studying the effects of interaction, frustration, and quantum interference. Here we consider a solvable example of a quantum spin liquid on a tri-coordinated quasicrystal. We extend Kitaev's original construction for the spin model to our quasicrystalline setting and perform a large scale flux-sampling to find the ground-state configuration in terms of the emergent majorana fermions and flux excitations. This reveals a fully gapped and time-reversal symmetric quantum spin liquid, regardless of the exchange anisotropies, accompanied by a tendency towards non-trivial (de-)localization at the edge and the bulk. The advent of moiré materials and a variety of quantum simulators provide a new platform to bring phases of quasicrystalline quantum matter to life in a controlled fashion.</p>

Incommensurate smectic charge modulation and intense local unidirectional nanostructure are visualized by using spectroscopic imaging - scanning tunneling microscopy. As topological materials with symmetry protected Dirac or Weyl fermions are mostly weakly correlated, the discovery of such an ELC phase are anomalous and raise questions on the origin of their emergence. Specifically, we demonstrate how chemical substitution generates these symmetry breaking phases before the system undergoes a charge density wave (CDW) - orthorhombic structural transition. Our results highlight the importance of impurities in realizing ELC phases and present a new material platform for exploring the interplay among quenched disorder, topology and electron correlation.</p>

            <h2>Instantaneous Response and Quantum Geometry of Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishchhal Verma, Raquel Queiroz</p>
            <p>We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. It therefore enables a systematic framework for computing the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and dielectric constant. This construction guarantees a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in a low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</p>

            <h2>Automated Tabletop Exfoliation and Identification of Monolayer Graphene Flakes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah D.S. Courtney, Mihir Pendharkar, Nathan J. Bittner, Aaron L. Sharpe, David Goldhaber-Gordon</p>
            <p>Over the past two decades, graphene has been intensively studied because of its remarkable mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. Initial studies were enabled by manual ``Scotch Tape'' exfoliation; nearly two decades later, this method is still widely used to obtain chemically-pristine flakes of graphene and other 2D van der Waals materials. Unfortunately, the yield of large, pristine flakes with uniform thickness is inconsistent. Thus, significant time and effort are required to exfoliate and locate flakes suitable for fabricating multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we describe a relatively affordable tabletop device (the ``eXfoliator'') that can reproducibly control key parameters and largely automate the exfoliation process. In a typical exfoliation run, the eXfoliator produces 3 or more large ($\ge400\ \mu$m$^2$) high-quality graphene monolayer flakes, allowing new users to produce such flakes at a rate comparable to manual exfoliation by an experienced user. We use an automated mapping system and a computer vision algorithm to locate candidate flakes. Our results provide a starting point for future research efforts to more precisely identify which parameters matter for the success of exfoliation, and to optimize them.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Andrieux</p>
            <p>The entropy production is commonly interpreted as measuring the distance from equilibrium. However, this explanation lacks a rigorous description due to the absence of a natural equilibrium measure. The present analysis formalizes this interpretation by expressing the entropy production of a Markov system as a divergence with respect to particular equilibrium dynamics. These equilibrium dynamics correspond to the closest reversible systems in the information-theoretic sense. This result yields new lower bounds for the entropy production and novel links between thermodynamics and information geometry.</p>

            <h2>Extended Metal-Insulator Crossover with Strong Antiferromagnetic Spin Correlation in Half-Filled 3D Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Feng Song, Youjin Deng, Yuan-Yao He</p>
            <p>The Hubbard model at temperatures above the Néel transition, despite being a paramagnet, can exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of Fermi surface, on-site interaction $U$ and thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, the understanding of the crossover physics remains only at a qualitative level, because of the intrinsically smooth behavior. Employing an improved variant of the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm equipped with numerical analytic continuation, we obtain a broad variety of thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling, quantitatively determine the crossover boundaries, and observe that the metal-insulator crossover regime, in which antiferromagnetic spin correlations appear strongest, exists over an extended regime in between the Fermi liquid for small $U$ and the Mott insulator for large $U$. In particular, the location of the most rapid suppression of double occupancy as $U$ increases, is found to fully reside in the metallic Fermi liquid regime, in contrast to the conventional intuition that it is a representative feature for entering the Mott insulator. Beside providing a reliable methodology for numerical study of crossover physics, our work can also serve as a timely and important guideline for the most recent optical lattice experiments.</p>

            <p>Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</p>

            <p>Chemical affinities are responsible for driving active matter systems out of equilibrium. At the nano-scale, molecular machines interact with the surrounding environment and are subjected to external forces. The mechano-chemical coupling which arises naturally in these systems reveals a complex interplay between chemical and mechanical degrees of freedom with strong impact on their active mechanism. By considering various models far from equilibrium, we show that the tuning of applied forces give rise to a nonlinear response that causes a non-monotonic behaviour in the machines' activity. Our findings have implications in understanding, designing, and triggering such processes by controlled application of external fields, including the collective dynamics of larger non-equilibrium systems where the total dissipation and performance might be affected by internal and inter-particle interactions.</p>

            <p>Lattice non-invertible symmetries have rich fusion structures and play important roles in understanding various exotic topological phases. In this paper, we explore methods to generate new lattice non-invertible transformations/symmetries from a given non-invertible seed transformation/symmetry. The new lattice non-invertible symmetry is constructed by composing the seed transformations on different sites or sandwiching a unitary transformation between the transformations on the same sites. In addition to known non-invertible symmetries with fusion algebras of Tambara-Yamagami $\mathbb Z_N\times\mathbb Z_N$ type, we obtain a new non-invertible symmetry in models with $\mathbb Z_N$ dipole symmetries. We name the latter the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry because it arises from gauging the dipole symmetry. We further study the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry in depth, including its topological defect, its anomaly and its associated generalized Kennedy-Tasaki transformation.</p>

            <h2>Spinless topological chirality from Umklapp scattering in twisted 3D structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Chen, Xu-Tao Zeng, Wang Yao</p>
            <p>Spinless systems exhibit unique topological characteristics compared to spinful ones, stemming from their distinct algebra. Without chiral interactions typically linked to spin, an intriguing yet unexplored interplay between topological and structural chirality may be anticipated. Here we discover spinless topological chiralities solely from structural chiralities that lie in the 3D spatial patterning of structureless units, exemplified using two types of twisted graphite systems. In a 3D screw twisted structure without periodicity in all directions, we find a chiral Weyl semimetal phase where bulk topology and chiral surface states are both determined by the screw direction. And in a 3D periodic structure formed with layer-alternating twist angle signs, a higher-order Dirac semimetal with chiral hinge states is discovered. Underlying these novel topological states is the intervalley Umklapp scattering that captures the chirality of the twisted interfaces, leading effectively to a sign-flipped chiral interlayer hopping, thereby introducing $\pi$-flux Z2 lattice gauge field that alters the symmetry algebra. Our findings point to a new pathway for engineering topological chirality through patterning twisted arrays of featureless units, which can expand the design principles for topological photonics and acoustics.</p>

In the quantum Hall regime, we demonstrate electron pumping from Landau levels in the leads, where the measurements exhibit pronounced oscillations in the lengths of the pumping plateaus with the magnetic field, reminiscent of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This similarity indicates that the pumping process is dependent on the density of states of the 2D electron gas over a narrow energy window. Based on these observations, we develop a new theoretical description of the operation of single-electron pumps which for the first time allows for the determination of the physical parameters of the experiment; such as the capture energy of the electrons, the broadening of the quantised Landau levels in the leads, and the quantum lifetime of the electrons.</p>

            <h2>Coulomb drag by motion of a monolayer polar crystal through graphene nanoconstriction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. L. Chudnovskiy</p>
            <p>We theoretically predict that the motion of a polar crystalline layer between two graphene planes exerts Coulomb drag on electrons in graphene, inducing a DC drag current. The physical mechanism underlying this drag arises from intervalley scattering of charge carriers in graphene caused by the time-dependent potential of the moving crystalline layer. This drag effect manifests above a finite threshold doping of the graphene layers, which is determined by the lattice structure and the relative orientation of the crystalline layer with respect to the graphene lattice. Additionally, the drag current exhibits a nonlinear Hall effect due to the interplay between the induced nonequilibrium pseudospin and the intrinsic pseudospin-orbit coupling in graphene. In turn, the drag exerted on electrons in graphene produces a backaction on the crystalline layer, which can be described as an increase in its dynamic viscosity.</p>

In particular, we find that both the dynamics and the mechanical fluctuations strongly depend on the loss distribution. The effect of the quantum fluctuations of the heat source is also discussed. Our approach provides the first steps towards a thorough, general platform for analyzing thermal back-action effects and their consequences, which may be of significance for future development in ultrasensitive nanomechanical research.</p>

            <p>We propose a new scheme for the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) Cooper pairing states within ultraflat bands. Central to our approach is the concept of "quantum geometric discrepancy" (QGD), which characterizes the discrepancy in the quantum geometry of paired electrons, giving rise to the flat-band FFLO instability. Remarkably, we find that this instability is directly related to a new quantum geometric quantity we term "anomalous quantum distance", which formally captures QGD. To model both QGD and the anomalous quantum distance, we examine a flat-band electronic Hamiltonian with tunable spin-dependent quantum metrics. Utilizing the band-projection method, we analyze the QGD-induced FFLO instability from pair susceptibility near the superconducting critical temperature. Furthermore, we perform self-consistent mean-field calculations to obtain the phase diagram of the BCS-FFLO transition driven by QGD, which aligns well with our analytical results. We emphasize that QGD serves as a distinctive protocol for stabilizing the flat-band FFLO phase.</p>

            <h2>Topological phase transitions in perovskite superlattices driven by temperature, electric field, and doping</h2>

            <p>Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.</p>

            <p>Competition between magnetism and superconductivity can lead to unconventional and topological superconductivity. However, the experimental confirmation of the presence of Majorana edge states and unconventional pairing currently poses a major challenge. Here we consider a two-dimensional lattice model for a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling to randomly distributed magnetic impurities. Depending on parameters of the model, this system may display topologically trivial or nontrivial edge states. We map out the phase diagram by computing the Bott index, a topological invariant defined in real space. We then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the Bott index from the local density of states (LDOS) at zero energy, obtaining high-accuracy results. We also train ML models to predict the amplitude of odd-frequency pairing in the anomalous Green's function at zero energy. Once the ML models are trained using the LDOS, which is experimentally accessible via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, our method could be applied to predict the number of Majorana edge states and to estimate the magnitude of odd-frequency pairing in real materials.</p>

            <p>Many types of spatiotemporal patterns have been observed under nonequilibrium conditions. Cycling through four or more states can provide specific dynamics, such as the spatial coexistence of multiple phases. However, transient dynamics have only been studied by previous theoretical models, since absorbing transition into a uniform phase covered by a single state occurs in the long-time limit. Here, we reported steady long-term dynamics using cyclic Potts models, wherein nucleation and growth play essential roles. Under the cyclic symmetry of the four states, the cyclic changes in the dominant phases and the spatial coexistence of the four phases are obtained at low and high flipping energies, respectively. Under asymmetric conditions, the spatial coexistence of two diagonal phases appears in addition to non-cyclic one-phase modes. The circular domains of the diagonal state are formed by the nucleation of other states, and they slowly shrink to reduce the domain boundary. When three-state cycling is added, competition between the two cycling modes changes the spatiotemporal patterns.</p>

Due to the absence of interactions the SFF grows exponentially in time, a result which we demonstrate through simple arguments, scaling collapses, and closed-form evaluation of the SFF. We study the role of interactions by numerically analyzing a kicked Ising model and find that the SFF crosses over to a linear growth regime consistent with many-body random matrix universality. Our exact results for the SFF provide a baseline for future studies of the crossover between single-particle and many-body random matrix behavior.</p>

            <p>The spectral form factor (SFF) is a powerful diagnostic of random matrix behavior in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a family of random circuit ensembles whose SFFs can be computed \textit{exactly}. These ensembles describe the evolution of non-interacting fermions in the presence of correlated on-site potentials drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular ensemble. For disorder parameters drawn from the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), we derive an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for any choice of system size $L$ and integer time $t$. When the disorder is drawn from the circular orthogonal or symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively), we carry out the disorder averages analytically and reduce the computation of the SFF at integer times to a combinatorial problem amenable to transfer matrix methods. In each of these cases the SFF grows exponentially in time, which we argue is a signature of random matrix universality at the single-particle level. Finally, we develop matchgate circuit representations of our circuit ensembles, enabling their experimental realization in quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.</p>

Our experiments were analogous to those on Heavy Metal-Ferromagnet bilayers and we extract the Orbital Hall Torque efficiency and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR). Through second-harmonic measurements, we investigate orbital Hall torque and UMR in bilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic materials (FM), such as Ni and NiFe, paired with light metals (LM), such as Ti and Nb. Our results demonstrate that LM/Ni bilayers exhibit enhanced damping-like torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) compared to LM/NiFe bilayers. This enhancement suggests that angular momentum is generated via the orbital Hall effect within the light metal, where it undergoes orbital-to-spin conversion within the Ni ferromagnet, ultimately transferring to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. Torque and UMR are also absent in single-layer devices, highlighting the necessity of the bilayer structure for orbital current generation.</p>

            <h2>Temperature dependent spin dynamics in La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$/Pt bilayers</h2>

            <p>Complex ferromagnetic oxides such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) offer pathways for creating energy efficient spintronic devices with new functionalities. LSMO exhibits high-temperature ferromagnetism, half metallicity, sharp resonance linewidth, low damping and a large anisotropic magnetoresistance response. Combined with Pt, a proven material with high spin-charge conversion efficiency, LSMO can be used to create robust nano-oscillators for neuromorphic computing. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and device level spin-pumping FMR measurements are performed to investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin transport in NdGaO3(110)/LSMO(15 nm)/Pt(0 and 5 nm) thin films ranging from 300K to 90K and compare the device performance with Py(7 nm)/Pt(5 nm) sample. The spin current pumped into Pt is quantified to determine the temperature dependent influence of interfacial interactions. The generated spin current in the micro-device is maximum at 170K for the optimally grown LSMO/Pt films. Additionally, this bilayer system exhibits low magnetic Gilbert damping (0.002), small linewidth (12 Oe) and a large spin Hall angle ($\approx$ 3.2%) at 170K. By fine-tuning the LSMO/Pt interface quality and integrating it into the device structure, the system exhibits a fourfold enhancement in signal output for LSMO/Pt devices compared to the Pt/Py system. Such robust device level performance can pave way for energy-efficient spintronic based devices.</p>

            <h2>Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyung-Su Kim, Veit Elser</p>
            <p>We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.</p>

            <h2>On the construction of explicit analytical driving forces for crack nucleation in the phase field approach to brittle fracture with application to Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager strength surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chockalingam Senthilnathan</p>
            <p>A series of recent papers have modified the classical variational phase-field fracture models to successfully predict both the nucleation and propagation of cracks in brittle fracture under general loading conditions. This is done through the introduction of a consistent crack nucleation driving force in the phase field governing equations, which results in the model being able to capture both the strength surface and fracture toughness of the material. This driving force has been presented in the literature for the case of Drucker-Prager strength surface and specific choice of stress states on the strength surface that are captured exactly for finite values of the phase field regularization length parameter $\varepsilon$. Here we present an explicit analytical expression for this driving force given a general material strength surface when the functional form of the strength locus is linear in the material parameter coefficients. In the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, the formulation reproduces the exact material strength surface and for finite $\varepsilon$ the strength surface is captured at any n 'distinct' points on the strength surface where n is the minimum number of material coefficients required to describe it. The presentation of the driving force in the current work facilitates the easy demonstration of its consistent nature. Further, in the equation governing crack nucleation, the toughness in the classical models is shown to be replaced by an effective toughness in the modified theory, that is dependent on the stress. The derived analytical expressions are verified via application to the widely employed Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager strength surfaces.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting Endo-reversible Carnot engine: Extending the Yvon engine</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma</p>
            <p>A famous paper [Am. J. Phys. 43, 22 (1975)] unveiled the efficiency at maximum power (EMP) of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, now commonly referred to as the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) engine, pioneering finite-time thermodynamics. Historically, despite the significance of the CA engine, similar findings had emerged at an earlier time, such as the Yvon engine proposed by J. Yvon in 1955 sharing the exact same EMP. However, the special setup of the Yvon engine has circumscribed its broader influence. This paper extends the Yvon engine model to achieve a level of generality comparable to that of the CA engine. A rigorous comparison reveals that the extended Yvon engine and CA engine represent the steady-state and cyclic forms of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, respectively, and are equivalent. Our work provides a pedagogical example for the teaching of thermodynamics and engineering thermodynamics, given that the simple and lucid derivation of the extended Yvon engine helps students initiate their understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Active matter as the underpinning agency for extraordinary sensitivity of biological membranes to electric fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anand Mathew, Yashashree Kulkarni</p>
            <p>Interaction of electric fields with biological cells is indispensable for many physiological processes. Thermal electrical noise in the cellular environment has long been considered as the minimum threshold for detection of electrical signals by cells. However, there is compelling experimental evidence that the minimum electric field sensed by certain cells and organisms is many orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal electrical noise limit estimated purely under equilibrium considerations. We resolve this discrepancy by proposing a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics model for active electromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating the minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane. Active membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out specific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central idea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different sources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric fields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental data available in the literature by varying the activity. Elucidating how active matter can modulate the sensitivity of cells to electric signals can open avenues for a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kelvin Dsouza, Patrick Del Vecchio, Nicolas Rotaru, Oussama Moutanabbir, Daryoosh Vashaee</p>
            <p>This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</p>

            <h2>Robust altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnetism in MnPX$_3$-based (X = S or Se) heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunsong Liu, Yanlong Liu, Xuefei Wang, Nan Xia, Guifang Xu, Yi Wang, Haifeng Wang, Weiwei Gao, Jijun Zhao</p>
            <p>The recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of materials with intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a Néel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures. For the AB-stacking heterostructures that are semiconducting, ferrimagnetic-type spin splitting emerges, and the fully compensated magnetization is protected by the Luttinger theorem. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP$_2$S$_6$, MnPX$_3$-based heterostructures can show tunable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on the electronic band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.</p>

            <p>We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that quickly and easily simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moiré systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sub-lattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moiré systems, and charge- and bond-density wave systems (2$H$-NbSe$_2$, 1$T$-TaS$_2$, Kekulé-distorted graphene, K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$). Finally, we show that PyAtoms can be used as a useful educational tool in entry- and senior-level physics courses.</p>

            <p>Predictive simulation of surface chemistry is of paramount importance for progress in fields from catalysis to electrochemistry and clean energy generation. Ab-initio quantum many-body methods should be offering deep insights into these systems at the electronic level, but are limited in their efficacy by their steep computational cost. In this work, we build upon state-of-the-art correlated wavefunctions to reliably converge to the `gold standard' accuracy in quantum chemistry for application to extended surface chemistry. Efficiently harnessing graphics processing unit acceleration along with systematically improvable multiscale resolution techniques, we achieve linear computational scaling up to 392 atoms in size. These large-scale simulations demonstrate the importance of converging to these extended system sizes, achieving a validating handshake between simulations with different boundary conditions for the interaction of water on a graphene surface. We provide a new benchmark for this water-graphene interaction that clarifies the preference for water orientations at the graphene interface. This is extended to the adsorption of carbonaceous molecules on chemically complex surfaces, including metal oxides and metal-organic frameworks, where we consistently achieve chemical accuracy compared to experimental references, and well inside the scatter of traditional density functional material modeling approaches. This pushes the state of the art for simulation of molecular adsorption on surfaces, and marks progress into a post-density functional era for more reliable and improvable approaches to first-principles modeling of surface problems at an unprecedented scale and accuracy using ab-initio quantum many-body methods.</p>

            <h2>Discovery of an Ultra-Stable Antiferromagnetic Two-Dimensional CrF3 Phase with Anisotropic Quasi-1D Mechanical, Electronic, and Thermal Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen, Fengyi Zhou, Yan Suo, Cheng Shao, Xu Cheng, Duo Wang, Biplab Sanyal</p>
            <p>We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.</p>

            <p>Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Response of superfluid fermions at finite temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumit Bhattacharjee, Elena Litvinova</p>
            <p>A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</p>

            <p>The wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys is very poor due to their inherent low hardness and poor tribological properties. Improving the wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys plays a significant role in expanding their application range. Various surface treatments have been used to produce protective coatings or layers for solving this problem. In this work, the Mg(OH)$_2$ layer with a thickness about 25 microns was directly formed on AZ91 magnesium alloy by oxidizing in superheated water vapor. SEM and XRD were employed to characterize the microstructure and phase composition of oxidized layer. The effect of oxidized layer on the friction and wear properties of magnesium alloy against the bearing steel ball were evaluated by using a reciprocating friction and wear test apparatus. The results showed that layer exhibited low friction coefficients and extremely small wear loss compared to the untreated substrate.

            <p>Vacancy-cluster color centers in lithium fluoride have been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally for over a century, giving rise to various applications in solid-state lasers, broadband photonic devices, and radiation dosimeters. These color centers are also attractive candidate platforms for applications in quantum information science, due to their spin properties and strong coupling to the crystal lattice, which allows their properties to be easily tuned. Here we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect. Our work establishes the accuracy of the computationally lightweight hybrid-functional approach for predicting the optical and energetic properties of color centers in polar materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yehonatan Avidan, Qianyi Li, Haim Sompolinsky</p>
            <p>Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.</p>

            <p>We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, we reproduce a molecule's admissible angular momentum states known from spectroscopy, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how the state space of a molecular species is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify molecular species whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxiang Xu, Jiangke Tao, Bin Chen</p>
            <p>Although the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) are pivotal in the conversion of ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work occurring in various biological processes, the precise sequence of these two events remains a subject of heated debate due to the involved tiny spatiotemporal scale. Here, we take a different path and choose to investigate how Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the power stroke affects muscle contraction in silico. Utilizing a mechanics model developed for the structural unit of muscle that systematically integrates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosins, we find that relatively slow Pi-release can markedly improve energy efficiency during muscle contraction. Our model's predictions are largely consistent with experimental data and our analysis suggests that a gradual Pi-release may offer a route to finely adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby indirectly modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance. We believe that this work can provide important insights into the kinetics and the function of Pi-release in the regulation of forces and motions generated by myosins for cellular processes.</p>

            <p>We show that the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) from a quantum many-body system is constrained by local athermality of an initial state and local entropy decrease brought about by quantum operations. The obtained universal upper bound on ergotropy implies that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis prohibits work extraction from energy eigenstates by means of finite-time unitary operations. This no-go property implies that Planck's principle, a form of the second law of thermodynamics, holds even for pure quantum states. Our result bridges two independently studied concepts of quantum thermodynamics, the second law and thermalization, via intrasystem correlations in many-body systems as a resource for work extraction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pete Rigas</p>
            <p>We initiate a novel application of the quantum-inverse scattering method for the 20-vertex model, building upon seminal work from Faddeev and Takhtajan on the study of Hamiltonian systems, with applications to crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, and integrability. In comparison to a previous work of the author in late $2023$ which characterized integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the 6-vertex model from integrability of inhomogeneous limit shapes, formalized in a work of Keating, Reshetikhin and Sridhar, notions similar to those of integrability can be realized for the 20-vertex model by studying new classes of higher-dimensional L-operators. In comparison to two-dimensional L-operators expressed in terms of Pauli basis elements, three-dimensional L-operators provided by Boos and colleagues have algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric, qualities, all of which impact leading order approximations of correlations, products of L-operators, the transfer matrix, and the quantum monodromy matrix in finite volume. In comparison to the inhomogeneous 6-vertex model, the 20-vertex model does not enjoy as strong of an integrability property through the existence of suitable action-angle variables, which is of interest to further explore, possibly from information on limit shapes given solutions to the three-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations.</p>

            <p>Atomic defects in solids offer a versatile basis to study and realize quantum phenomena and information science in various integrated systems. All-electrical pumping of single defects to create quantum light emission has been realized in several platforms including color centers in diamond and silicon carbide, which could lead to the circuit network of electrically triggered single-photon sources. However, a wide conduction channel which reduces the carrier injection per defect site has been a major obstacle. Here, we realize a device concept to construct electrically pumped single-photon emission using a van der Waals stacked structure with atomic plane precision. Defect-induced tunneling currents across graphene and NbSe2 electrodes sandwiching an atomically thin h-BN layer allow robust and persistent generation of non-classical light from h-BN. The collected emission photon energies range between 1.4 and 2.9 eV, revealing the electrical excitation of a variety of atomic defects. By analyzing the dipole axis of observed emitters, we further confirm that emitters are crystallographic defect structures of h-BN crystal.

            <p>In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.</p>

            <h2>Fast and scalable finite-element based approach for density functional theory calculations using projector-augmented wave method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartick Ramakrishnan, Sambit Das, Phani Motamarri</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology that utilizes a local real-space formulation of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method discretized with a finite-element (FE) basis to enable accurate and large-scale electronic structure calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-space approach for DFT calculations, combining the efficiency of PAW formalism involving smooth electronic fields with the ability of systematically improvable higher-order finite-element basis to achieve significant computational gains. In particular, we have developed efficient strategies for solving the underlying FE discretized PAW generalized eigenproblem by employing the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration approach to compute the desired eigenspace in each self-consistent field iteration. These strategies leverage the low-rank perturbation of the FE basis overlap matrix in conjunction with reduced order quadrature rules to invert the discretized PAW overlap matrix while also exploiting the sparsity of both the local and non-local parts of the discretized PAW Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. Using the proposed approach, we benchmark the accuracy and performance on various representative examples involving periodic and non-periodic systems with plane-wave-based PAW implementations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a considerable computational advantage ($\sim$ 5$\times$ -- 10$\times$) over state-of-the-art plane-wave methods for medium to large-scale systems ($\sim$ 6,000 -- 35,000 electrons). Finally, we show that our approach (PAW-FE) significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to achieve the desired accuracy, thereby enabling large-scale DFT simulations ($>$ 50,000 electrons) at an order of magnitude lower computational cost compared to norm-conserving pseudopotential calculations using finite-element discretized calculations.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic classification of Hietarinta's solutions of Yang-Baxter equations~:~invertible $4\times 4$ operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Somnath Maity, Vivek Kumar Singh, Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin</p>
            <p>In order to examine the simulation of integrable quantum systems using quantum computers, it is crucial to first classify Yang-Baxter operators. Hietarinta was among the first to classify constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). Including the one produced by the permutation operator, he was able to construct eleven families of invertible solutions. These techniques are effective for 4 by 4 solutions, but they become difficult to use for representations with more dimensions. To get over this limitation, we use algebraic ansätze to generate the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent way. We employ four distinct algebraic structures that, depending on the qubit representation, replicate 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families. Among the techniques are partition algebras, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and a collection of commuting operators. Using these techniques, we do not obtain the $(2,2)$ Hietarinta class.</p>

            <h2>Flexible framework of computing binding free energy using the energy representation theory of solution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuya Okita, Yusei Maruyama, Kento Kasahara, Nobuyuki Matubayasi</p>
            <p>Host-guest binding plays a crucial role in the functionality of various systems, and its efficiency is often quantified using the binding free energy, which represents the free-energy difference between the bound and dissociated states. Here, we propose a methodology to compute the binding free energy based on the energy representation (ER) theory of solution that enables us to evaluate the free-energy difference between the systems of interest with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike the other free-energy methods, such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR), the ER theory does not require the MD simulations for hypothetical intermediate states connecting the systems of interest, leading to reduced computational costs. By constructing the thermodynamic cycle of the binding process that is suitable for the ER theory, a robust calculation of the binding free energy is realized. We apply the present method to the self-association of \textit{N}-methylacetamide (NMA) in different solvents and the binding of aspirin to $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) in water. In the former case, the present method estimates that the binding free energy decreases as the solvent polarity decreases. This trend is consistent with the experimental finding. For the latter system, the binding free energies for the two representative CD-aspirin bound complexes, primary (P) and secondary (S) complexes, are estimated to be $-5.2\pm 0.1$ and $-5.03\pm 0.09~\mathrm{kcalmol^{-1}}$, respectively. These values are satisfactorily close to those from the BAR method [$-4.2\pm 0.2$ and $-4.1\pm 0.2\mathrm{kcal~mol^{-1}}$ for P and S, respectively]. Furthermore, the interaction-energy component analysis reveals that the van der Waals interaction between aspirin and CD dominantly contributes to the stabilization of the bound complexes, that is in harmony with the well-known binding mechanism in the CD systems.</p>

            <h2>Macroscopic stress, couple stress and flux tensors derived through energetic equivalence from microscopic continuous and discrete heterogeneous finite representative volumes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Eliáš, Gianluca Cusatis</p>
            <p>This paper presents a rigorous derivation of equations to evaluate the macroscopic stress tensor, the couple stress tensor, and the flux vector equivalent to underlying microscopic fields in continuous and discrete heterogeneous systems with independent displacements and rotations. Contrary to the classical asymptotic expansion homogenization, finite size representative volume is considered. First, the macroscopic quantities are derived for a heterogeneous Cosserat continuum. The resulting continuum equations are discretized to provide macroscopic quantities in discrete heterogeneous systems. Finally, the expressions for discrete system are derived once again, this time considering the discrete nature directly. The formulations are presented in two variants, considering either internal or external forces, couples, and fluxes. The derivation is based on the virtual work equivalence and elucidates the fundamental significance of the couple stress tensor in the context of balance equations and admissible virtual deformation modes. Notably, an additional term in the couple stress tensor formula emerges, explaining its dependence on the reference system and position of the macroscopic point. The resulting equations are verified by comparing their predictions with known analytical solutions and results of other numerical models under both steady state and transient conditions.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Dynamic Range of Sub-Quantum-Limit Measurements via Quantum Deamplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Liu, Ming Xue, Xinwei Li, Denis V. Vasilyev, Ling-Na Wu, Vladan Vuletić</p>
            <p>Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large dynamic range is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <p>We introduce a systematic approach that enables two robust methods for performing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in reflection geometry. Using the Kramers-Kronig relations in connection to accurate experimental measurements of the amplitude of the terahertz electric field, we show how the correct phase of the same field can be retrieved, even in the case of partly misaligned measurements. Our technique allows to accurately estimate the optical properties of in principle any material that reflects terahertz radiation. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach by extracting the complex refractive index of InSb, a material with a strong plasma resonance in the low-terahertz range. Our technique applies to arbitrary incidence angles and polarization states.</p>

            <p>We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigenvalue splitting.</p>

            <h2>Aharonov-Bohm Interference in Even-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall States</h2>

            <p>Position exchange of non-Abelian anyons affects the quantum state of their system in a topologically-protected way. Their expected manifestations in even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems offer the opportunity to directly study their unique statistical properties in interference experiments. In this work, we present the observation of coherent Aharonov-Bohm interference at two even-denominator states in high-mobility bilayer graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures by employing the Fabry-Pérot interferometry (FPI) technique. Operating the interferometer at a constant filling factor, we observe an oscillation period corresponding to two flux quanta inside the interference loop, $\Delta\Phi=2\Phi_0$, at which the interference does not carry signatures of non-Abelian statistics. The absence of the expected periodicity of $\Delta\Phi=4\Phi_0$ may indicate that the interfering quasiparticles carry the charge $e^* = \frac{1}{2}e$ or that interference of $e^* = \frac{1}{4}e$ quasiparticles is thermally smeared. Interestingly, at two hole-conjugate states, we also observe oscillation periods of half the expected value, indicating interference of $e^* = \frac{2}{3}e$ quasiparticles instead of $e^* = \frac{1}{3}e$. To probe statistical phase contributions, we operated the FPI with controlled deviations of the filling factor, thereby introducing fractional quasiparticles inside the interference loop. The resulting changes to the interference patterns at both half-filled states indicate that the additional bulk quasiparticles carry the fundamental charge $e^*=\frac{1}{4}e$, as expected for non-Abelian anyons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Dong, Leonid Levitov, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>Systems in which exchange interactions couple carrier spins to a spin texture with a net chirality exhibit a spin-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, where the geometric gauge field and pseudo-magnetic field have opposite signs for carriers with opposite spins. As a result, Cooper pairs see a net zero vector potential and superconducting pairing is not hindered by pair-breaking effects. This allows superconductivity to occur even when the geometric field induces quantized Landau levels. We identify the dominant pairing order as an s-wave pair density wave of an FFLO type. Flat Landau levels can significantly enhance superconducting $T_c$, favoring superconductivity over competing orders. This exotic paired state features tell-tale signatures such as flat bands of Bogoliubov-deGennes quasiparticles, manifest through Landau level-like resonances in the quasiparticle density of states.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting Diode Effect in Double Quantum Dot Device</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Go Takeuchi, Mikio Eto</p>
            <p>Superconducting diode effect (SDE) is theoretically examined in double quantum dot coupled to three superconducting leads, $L$, $R1$ and $R2$. Lead $L$ is commonly connected to two quantum dots (QD1, QD2) while lead $R1$ ($R2$) is connected to QD1 (QD2) only. The phase differences $\varphi_{1}$ between leads $L$ and $R1$ and $\varphi_{2}$ between leads $L$ and $R2$ are tuned independently. The critical current into lead $R1$ depends on its direction unless $\varphi_{2} = 0$, $\pi$, which is ascribable to the formation of Andreev molecule between the QDs. In the absence of electron-electron interaction $U$ in the QDs, the spectrum of the Andreev bound states forms Dirac cones in the $\varphi_{1}-\varphi_{2}$ plane if the energy levels in the QDs are tuned to the Fermi level in the leads. The SDE is enhanced to almost 30\% when $\varphi_{2}$ is set to the value at the Dirac points. In the presence of $U$, the SDE is still observed when $U$ is smaller than the superconducting energy gap in the leads. Our device should be one of the minimal models for the SDE since a similar device with a single QD does not show the SDE.</p>

            <h2>Phase-Space Approach to Wannier Pairing and Bogoliubov Orbitals in Square-Octagon Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajesh O. Sharma, Tanmoy Das</p>
            <p>Low-energy lattice models are the cornerstone for understanding many-body effects and interactions between systems and measurements. A key challenge is identifying appropriate states that canonically transform between momentum and real space while retaining the correlation, entanglement, and geometric properties - generally called the Wannier obstruction. Here, we introduce a phase-space approach to bypass these obstructions. Instead of treating phase space as a manifold, we embed real space through a Bloch vector space at each momentum. Orbital and spin states are introduced through product states with the Bloch vector, while quantum statistics, correlations, topology, and entanglements are inherited from the Hamiltonian. We apply this framework to explore unconventional pairing symmetry and the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) equation in the phase space. Our findings demonstrate that while superconductivity exhibits global coherence in momentum space, the local Wannier orbital symmetry primarily determines the pairing symmetry. We analytically solve the spin-fluctuation mediated pairing symmetry on the phase space by engineering a flat band with artificial gauge fields. We then apply the model to a square-octagon superconductor Lu$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT) to unravel a coexistence of nodeless $s_{\pm}$ and nodal $s_{z^2}$ pairing symmetries. This phase-space framework provides a robust, obstruction-free lattice model for complex many-body systems and their exotic excitations.</p>

            <h2>An Addressable and Tunable Module for Donor-based Scalable Silicon Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shihang Zhang, Yu He, Peihao Huang</p>
            <p>Donor-based spin qubit offers a promising silicon quantum computing route for building large-scale qubit arrays, attributed to its long coherence time and advancements in nanoscale donor placement. However, the state-of-the-art device designs face scalability challenges, notably in achieving tunable two-qubit coupling and ensuring qubit addressability. Here, we propose a surface-code-compatible architecture, where each module has both tunable two-qubit gates and addressable single-qubit gates by introducing only a single extra donor in a pair of donors. We found that to compromise between the requirement of tunability and that of addressability, an asymmetric scheme is necessary. In this scheme, the introduced extra donor is strongly tunnel-coupled to one of the donor spin qubits for addressable single-qubit operation, while being more weakly coupled to the other to ensure the turning on and off of the two-qubit operation. The fidelity of single-qubit and two-qubit gates can exceed the fault-tolerant threshold in our design. Additionally, the asymmetric scheme effectively mitigates valley oscillations, allowing for engineering precision tolerances up to a few nanometers. Thus, our proposed scheme presents a promising prototype for large-scale, fault-tolerant, donor-based spin quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Spintronic Terahertz emitters, based on optically triggered spin-to-charge interconversion processes, have recently emerged as novel route towards compact and efficient THz sources. Yet, the next challenge for further technologically-relevant devices remains to modulate the emission, with low-energy consumption operation. To this aim, ferroelectric materials coupled to active spin-orbit layers such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are suitable candidates. In this work, we present the realization of a large area heterostructure of CoFeB/PtSe2/MoSe2 on a bi-domain LiNbO3 substrate. Using THz time-domain spectroscopy, we show that the ferroelectric polarization direction induces a sizeable modulation of the THz emission. We rationalise these experimental results by using band structure and spin accumulation calculations that are consistent with an interfacial spin-to-charge conversion mediated by inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect at the MoSe2/PtSe2 interface and being tuned by ferroelectricity in the adjacent LiNbO3 surface. This work points out the relevance of field effect spin-orbit architectures for novel THz technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengtian Li, Zeyu Li, Zhenhua Qiao</p>
            <p>We theoretically demonstrate that Chern number tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and second-order topological insulators can be induced in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator (TI), i.e., Kane-Mele model, by applying $d$-wave altermagnetism. When the Néel vector of altermagentism lies in the $x-y$ plane, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ TI is broken and driven into a second-order topological insulator phase, exhibiting the representative corner states at nanoflakes. When the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is further included, the second-order TI is further driven into the QAHE phase with various Chern numbers (e.g., $\mathcal{C}=\pm1$ or $\pm3$). When the Néel vector is along $z$ direction, the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is necessary to break the mirror symmetry to allow a sequential emergence of second-order TI and QAHE along with the increase of altermagentism strength. We also observe the QAHE with mixed-chirality, i.e., there exist counter-propagating edge modes but net chiral current at the ribbon boundary. Our work shows that altermagnetism can play a crucial role in exploring a rich variety of topological phases, just like its counterparts of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Li, Yulei Han, Zhenhua Qiao</p>
            <p>Recently, the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) has been theoretically proposed in compensated antiferromagnetic systems by using the magnetic topological insulator model [see arXiv:2404.13305 (2024)]. However, the related and systematic study based on a realistic material system is still limited. As the only experimentally realized antiferromagnetic topological insulator, MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ becomes a vital platform for exploring various topological states. In this work, by using the comprehensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the QAHE can also be realized in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ without combined parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. Using a magnetic topological insulator model, the layer-resolved Chern number is calculated to further understand the physical origin of different Chern numbers. The application of external hydrostatic pressure can strengthen the Te-Te quasicovalent bond due to the dramatic compression of the van der Waals gap. Thus, the resulting topological nontrivial gap can exceed the room-temperature energy scale in a wide range of pressures. Additionally, we find that constructing MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$/CrI$_{3}$ heterostructure can realize the compensated antiferromagnetic configurations with QAHE. Our findings illustrate the realization of QAHE in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and provide a reliable strategy to obtain the corresponding magnetic configurations.</p>

Our finding presented here offers a first exact derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution in the dynamics of the interacting quantum model not being mapped to a noninteracting fermion Hamiltonian via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. On the basis of the exact solution of the folded XXZ model and our numerical analysis of the XXZ model, we discuss a universal behavior for the probability of finding the left-most up-spin in the XXZ model.</p>

            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenide moiré homobilayers have emerged as a platform in which magnetism, strong correlations, and topology are intertwined. In a large magnetic field, the energetic alignment of states with different spin in these systems is dictated by both strong Zeeman splitting and the structure of the Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum, yet the latter has been difficult to probe experimentally. Here we conduct local thermodynamic measurements of twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers that reveal a cascade of magnetic phase transitions. We understand these transitions as the filling of individual Hofstadter subbands, allowing us to extract the structure and connectivity of the Hofstadter spectrum of a single spin. The onset of magnetic transitions is independent of twist angle, indicating that the exchange interactions of the component layers are only weakly modified by the moiré potential. In contrast, the magnetic transitions are associated with stark changes in the insulating states at commensurate filling. Our work achieves a spin-resolved measurement of Hofstadter's butterfly despite overlapping states, and it disentangles the role of material and moiré effects on the nature of the correlated ground states.</p>

            <p>Spin-driven multiferroics exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling, with notable polarization changes under a magnetic field, but these effects are usually limited to high-Z magnetic insulators with low electronic polarization. In this work, we introduce altermagnets as a promising platform for achieving strong magnetoelectric coupling in low-Z systems with substantial polarization. This large polarization arises from a design principle that utilizes the Heisenberg-like exchange striction mechanism, eliminating the reliance on spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This approach enables the Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic phase derived from altermagnetic insulators to achieve substantial polarization without spin splitting, providing a flexible platform for regulating spin-splitting phenomena. Through first-principles simulations and an effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that materials in the LiMnO2 family and strained RuF4 family can achieve polarization values exceeding 1.0 {\mu}C/cm2, an order of magnitude larger than those found in SOC-driven multiferroics. Moreover, their magnetoelectric coupling is one to two orders of magnitude stronger than that observed in conventional multiferroics and those driven by SOC.</p>

            <p>Electrical breakdown in a dielectric capacitor occurs when the electric field strength across the dielectric material exceeds its breakdown strength. A conductive channel through the dielectric emerges, resulting in a sudden surge of current. Self-healing represents a phenomenon of restoration of a capacitor's performance. The efficiency of self-healing depends on the products of high-temperature decomposition of the electrode and dielectric. We report atomistic simulations of the soot's chemical composition in the case of gold electrodes and four popular dielectric polymers: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), and polyimide (PI). We unravel that gold atoms form clusters within the carbon-rich soot, limiting their interactions with non-metal elements. The oxygen atoms of PET, PC, and PI act as stabilizers of gold thanks to electrostatic attraction. Compared to zinc, gold equalizes the soot conductivity in all samples but does not impact polymer gasification. The suitability of dielectrics for self-healing must be rated based on the volatile by-products: PP > PC > PET > PI. Mind that PP issues three times more gases than PI. Therefore, the size of semiconducting soot is substantially smaller in the case of PP than in the case of PI. The obtained numerical results provide unprecedented physical insights into the phenomenon of self-healing and clearly drive the efforts to extend the lifespans of the metalized film capacitors.</p>

            <p>Carbyne, a sp1-hybridized allotrope of carbon, is a linear carbon chain with exceptional theoretically predicted properties that surpass those of sp2-hybridized graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). However, the existence of carbyne has been debated due to its instability caused by Peierls distortion, which limits its practical development. The only successful synthesis of carbyne has been achieved inside CNTs, resulting in a form known as confined carbyne (CC). However, CC can only be synthesized inside multi-walled CNTs, limiting its property-tuning capabilities to the inner tubes of the CNTs. Here, we present a universal method for synthesizing CC inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm. Aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are filled inside SWCNTs and subsequently transformed into CC under low-temperature annealing. A variety of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are confirmed as effective precursors for formation of CC, with Raman frequencies centered around 1861 cm-1. Enriched (6,5) and (7,6) SWCNTs with diameters less than 0.8 nm are less effective than the SWCNTs with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm for CC formation. Furthermore, resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals that optical band gap of the CC at 1861 cm-1 is 2.353 eV, which is consistent with the result obtained using a linear relationship between the Raman signal and optical band gap. This newly developed approach provides a versatile route for synthesizing CC from various precursor molecules inside diverse templates, which is not limited to SWCNTs but could extend to any templates with appropriate size, including molecular sieves, zeolites, boron nitride nanotubes, and metal-organic frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Insulator and Electrode Materials Marginally Influence Carbonized Layer Conductivity in Metalized-Film Capacitors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vitaly V. Chaban, Nadezhda Andreeva</p>
            <p>Capacitor self-healing is a generalized term to describe physical and chemical processes restoring the functionalities of a dielectric capacitor after an electrical breakdown. The efficacy of self-healing depends on the elemental composition of a metalized-film capacitor. We report atomistic simulations of self-healing from a chemical perspective proving the impossibility of tuning the electrical conductivity of the soot by finding an interplay of various polymers and electrodes. All investigated soot samples turn out to possess carbon-rich semiconducting skeletons with numerous unsaturated C-C covalent bonds. They exhibit electrical conductivities of the same order of magnitude, irrespective of initial chemical compositions and properties of the chosen insulating polymers. Upon reporting the new results, we discuss less evident approaches to diminish the soot conductivity. We conclude that the quality of capacitor self-healing can be assessed by counting gaseous by-products of electrical breakdown or evaluating the volume of the solid-state semiconducting counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Machine learning the Renyi entropy of multiple disjoint intervals with neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han-Qing Shi, Hai-Qing Zhang</p>
            <p>Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals are computed from the improved swapping operations by two methods: one is from the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and the other one is from the state-of-the-art machine learning method with neural networks. We use the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model in one-dimension to demonstrate the strategy of the improved swapping operation. In particular, we study the second Renyi entropy with two, three and four disjoint intervals. We find that the results from the above two methods match each other very well within errors, which indicates that the machine learning method is applicable for calculating the Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals. Moreover, as the magnetic field increases, the Renyi entropy grows as well until the system arrives at the critical point of the phase transition. However, as the magnetic field exceeds the critical value, the Renyi entropy will decrease since the system enters the paramagnetic phase. Overall, these results match the theoretical predictions very well and demonstrate the high accuracy of the machine learning methods with neural networks.</p>

            <h2>Efficient inverted HTL-free Sm$_2$NiMnO$_6$-based perovskite solar cell: a SCAPS-1D study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nassim Mahammedi</p>
            <p>The transition to sustainable energy has accelerated research into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. Despite their remarkable efficiencies, the commercialization of PSCs is hindered by lead toxicity and material instability. In this study, we explore a lead-free Samarium-based double perovskite oxide Sm$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (SNMO), as the active absorber layer in an innovative inverted HTL-free PSC architecture. Using SCAPS-1D simulations, we optimized the device configuration to achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.93% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.8 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.46 mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 82.14%. We demonstrate that increasing the SNMO absorber thickness enhances light harvesting in the red spectrum region (~620 nm), shifting the external quantum efficiency (EQE) peak from 380 nm at 50 nm thickness to about 620 nm at 1 um. We also investigated various electron transport layers (ETLs) and found that the indium tin oxide (ITO) exhibited superior PV performances, boosting the PCE to ~12.6% due to its excellent conductivity and optimal energy band alignment with SNMO. These findings establish SNMO as a promising absorber material for environmentally friendly PSCs, paving the way for cheaper, simpler, scalable, and sustainable photovoltaic solutions. This work highlights the potential of HTL-free architectures in reducing costs and complexities while maintaining competitive efficiencies, offering a significant step forward in advancing lead-free solar technologies.</p>

            <p>A two-dimensional second-order topological insulator exhibits topologically protected zero-energy states at its corners. In the literature, the breathing kagome lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping is often mentioned as an example of a two-dimensional second-order topological insulator. Here we show by explicit construction that the corner states of the breathing kagome lattice can be removed by a continuous change of the hopping parameters, without breaking any of the model's symmetries, without closing bulk and boundary gaps, and without introducing hopping terms not present in the original model. Furthermore, we topologically classify all three-band lattice models with the same crystalline symmetries as the breathing kagome lattice and show that though none of the phases have protected zero-energy corner states, some of the phases are obstructed atomic limits which exhibit a filling anomaly.</p>

            <p>Determining the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is an essential step towards uncovering their superconducting mechanism. It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Under external stimuli, lead halide perovskites exhibit large atomic fluctuations, impacting optical and electron transport properties that affect device performance in operational settings. However, a thorough understanding of the atomic basis for the underlying structural instability is still absent. Focusing on the model material CsPbBr$_3$, the inherent lattice softness of halide perovskites is elucidated at the atomic level through in-situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements under pressure complemented by atomic level simulations. We identify and explore the nature of the first-order phase transition to a distorted P21/c phase at 1.3 GPa, induced by the sudden Cs-Br bonds breaking. Unlike classical transition metal oxide perovskites, where the internal energy term dominates, we show explicitly that pressure primarily influences the Gibbs free energy for halide perovskites through the pressure-volume term. As such, strategically mitigating bond strains from volume shrinkage is the key to suppressing the first-order behavior for maintaining the coordinates of PbX$_6$ polyhedral upon external perturbation. Our thermodynamic calculation reveals the demand for high entropy in the -T*del-S term, which can be achieved by exploring a broader spectrum of doped A site and B sites in ABX$_3$ systems, enabling continuous structural changes that facilitate recovery from mechanical damage in practical applications.</p>

            <p>Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement as a topological marker in harmonically confined attractive Fermi-Hubbard chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marina Sanino, Isaac Carvalho, Vivian França</p>
            <p>We investigate the single-site von Neumann entropy along a harmonically confined superfluid chain, as described by the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model with strongly attractive interactions. We find that by increasing the confinement (or equivalently the particle filling) the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid (SF) to a non-trivial topological insulator (TI) phase, which is characterized by an insulating bulk surrounded by highly entangled superfluid edges. These highly entangled states are found to be robust against perturbations and topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry, which is locally preserved. We also find a semi-quantitative agreement between entanglement and superconducting order parameter profiles, confirming then that entanglement can be used as a topological marker and an order parameter in these systems. The charge gap not only confirms the SF-TI transition, but also shows that this transition is mediated by a metallic intermediate regime within the bulk. Using the gap we could depict a phase diagram for which the non-trivial topological insulator can be found in such harmonically confined attractive systems.</p>

Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.</p>

            <p>In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of the thermoelectric responses exhibited by monolayer pristine graphene in response to temperature variations. Employing the Boltzmann transport theory, we rigorously examined and evaluated various thermoelectric coefficients, with particular emphasis on elucidating their behavior under different scattering mechanisms. We derived the analytical expressions for electrical conductivity, thermopower, and thermal conductivity at low temperatures by Sommerfeld expansion of the Fermi integral. We demonstrated that our numerically obtained values are consistent with the analytical calculations at low temperatures and hence obeying Mott and Wiedeman Franz law. However, the deviation was observed at higher temperatures. Furthermore, we performed theoretical calculations of chemical potential at both low and high temperatures and compared them with our numerically evaluated results at all temperatures. Through extensive calculations and meticulous evaluation, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate thermoelectric properties inherent in monolayer pristine graphene.</p>

            <p>We use Brownian dynamics simulations and theory to study the over-damped spatiotemporal dynamics and pattern formation in a fluid-permeated array of equally spaced, active, elastic filaments that are pinned at one end and free at the other. The filaments are modeled as connected colloidal chains with activity incorporated via compressive follower forces acting along the filament backbone. The length of the chains is smaller than the thermal persistence length. For a range of filament separation and activity values, we find that the filament array eventually self-assembles into a series of regularly spaced, kinetically arrested, compact clusters. Filament activity, geometry, elasticity, and grafting density are each seen to crucially influence the size, shape, and spacing of emergent clusters. Furthermore, cluster shapes for different grafting densities can be rescaled into self-similar forms with activity-dependent scaling exponents. We derive theoretical expressions that relate the number of filaments in a cluster and the spacing between clusters, to filament activity, filament elasticity, and grafting density. Our results provide insight into the physical mechanisms involved in the initiation of clustering and suggest that steric contact forces and friction balance active forces and filament elasticity to stabilize the clusters. Our simulations suggest design principles to realize filament-based clusters and similar self-assembling biomimetic materials using active colloids or synthetic microtubule-motor systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.</p>

The polished surfaces of as-cast alloys were leached with 10 mole NaOH solution for 0.5- 8 hours. The x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques have been used for structural and microstructural characterization. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis has been carried out for chemical composition analysis. Chemical leaching exclusively removes the Al from the surfaces of the Al65Cu15Co20 and Al65Cu20Co15 decagonal quasicrystalline alloys, consequently by the formation of porous structure containing nano size particles of Cu, Co and their oxides have been observed. Al65Cu15Co20 exhibits high porosity in comparison to Al65Cu20Co15 alloy, however the size of the precipitated nano-particles i.e. Cu, Co, Cu2O and CuO were smaller in the case of Al65Cu20Co15 alloy.

            <p>Characterizing the local voltage distribution within nanophysiological domains, driven by ionic currents through membrane channels, is crucial for studying cellular activity in modern biophysics, yet it presents significant experimental and theoretical challenges. Theoretically, the complexity arises from the difficulty of solving electro-diffusion equations in three-dimensional domains. Currently, there are no methods available for obtaining asymptotic computations or approximated solutions of nonlinear equations, and numerically, it is challenging to explore solutions across both small and large spatial scales. In this work, we develop a method to solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations with ionic currents entering and exiting through two narrow, circular window channels located on the boundary. The inflow through the first window is composed of a single cation, while the outflow maintains a constant ionic density satisfying local electro-neutrality conditions. Employing regular expansions and Green's function representations, we derive the ionic profiles and voltage drops in both small and large charge regimes. We explore how local surface curvature and window channels size influence voltage dynamics and validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations, assessing the accuracy of our asymptotic computations. These novel relationships between current, voltage, concentrations and geometry can enhance the characterization of physiological behaviors of nanodomains.</p>

            <h2>Crossover of Critical Behavior in Dynamic Phase Transitions of Ferromagnetic Thin Films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erol Vatansever, Mikel Quintana, Andreas Berger</p>
            <p>We investigate the crossover of critical behavior for the dynamic phase transition (DPT) in ferromagnetic thin films using Monte Carlo simulations of the kinetic Ising model, focusing on the scaling behavior of the dynamic order parameter under a time-dependent external magnetic field. Specifically, we study the transition of the critical behavior of such film systems from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) as a function of the film thickness and the distance to the critical point, which enables dimensional crossover observations. Our results indicate that the effective critical exponents exhibit a clear transition in their scaling behavior, with thinner films showing 2D-like characteristics and thicker films displaying 3D-like behavior, for both the DPT and the thermodynamic phase transitions (TPT). Quantitatively, the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior occurs at larger film thicknesses for the DPT compared to the TPT, suggesting that DPT and TPT are governed by distinctly different length scales and underlying surface effects. These findings are in agreement with experimental observations in ultrathin Co films, where dynamic and thermodynamic critical exponents were found to differ. Therefore, our study provides an in-depth explanation for critical phenomena in thin-film ferromagnets driven by a time-dependent magnetic field. By comparing the dimensional crossover properties of both TPT and DPT, we present a comprehensive understanding of how thin-film geometry and surface effects influence the scaling laws and critical behavior in nonequilibrium systems.</p>

            <p>In this work, we develop a non-equilibrium steady-state non-crossing approximation (NESS-NCA) impurity solver applicable to general impurity problems. The choice of the NCA as the impurity solver enables both a more accurate description of correlation effects with larger Coulomb interaction and scalability to multi-orbital systems. Based on this development, we investigate strongly correlated non-equilibrium states of a dissipative lattice system under constant electric fields. Both the electronic Coulomb interaction and the electric field are treated non-perturbatively using dynamical mean-field theory in its non-equilibrium steady-state form (NESS-DMFT) with the NESS-NCA impurity solver. We validate our implementation using a half-filled single-band Hubbard model attached to a fictitious free Fermion reservoir, which prevents temperature divergence. As a result, we identify metallic and insulating phases as functions of the electric field and the Coulomb interaction along with a phase coexistence region amid the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT). We find that the MIT driven by the electric field is qualitatively similar to the equilibrium MIT as a function of temperature, differing from results in previous studies using the iterative perturbation theory (IPT) impurity solver. Finally, we highlight the importance of the morphology of a correlated system under the influence of an electric field.</p>

            <p>Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by the empirical pseudopotential method to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature and compare our results with previous work. This framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen Liang, Zhenhua Yu</p>
            <p>How environments affect dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum boson modes. Previous analytic solution shows that, starting from the initial state that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamic transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here, we study the dynamic transition for the case that $N$ particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. In particular, we access the effects of an all to all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the non-perturbative time-dependent numerical renormalization group method. We find that the critical coupling for the transition decreases with $N$, and is suppressed (enlarged) by the anti-ferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding on environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <p>In the relentless pursuit of advancing semiconductor technologies, the demand for atomic layer processes has given rise to innovative processes, which have already played a significant role in the continued miniaturization features. Among these, atomic layer etching (ALE) is gaining increasing attention, offering precise control over material removal at the atomic level. Despite some thermal ALE achieved sub-nm etching controllability, the currently practical ALE processes that involve plasmas steps often suffer from high etch rates due to the scarcity of highly synergistic ALE half-reactions. To overcome this limitation, we developed an ALE process of silicon dioxide (SiO2) on a silicon wafer using sequential pure sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas exposure and argon (Ar) plasma etching near room temperature, achieving a stable and consistent etching rate of approximately 1.4 Å/cycle. In this process, neither of the two half-cycle reactions alone produces etching effects, and etching only occurs when the two are repeated in sequence, which means a 100% synergy. The identification of temperature and plasma power windows further substantiates the high synergy of our ALE process. Moreover, detailed morphology characterization over multiple cycles reveals a directional etching effect. This study provides a reliable, reproducible, and highly controllable ALE process for SiO2 etching, which is promising for nanofabrication processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cory Hargus, Federico Ghimenti, Julien Tailleur, Frédéric van Wijland</p>
            <p>When submerged in a chiral active bath, a passive object becomes a spinning ratchet imbued with odd transport properties. In the adiabatic limit of a massive object, we derive the most general Langevin dynamics for a rigid body in a chiral active bath, with odd diffusion and odd mobility connected by an Einstein relation, and numerically explore the breakdown of these predictions beyond the adiabatic limit. We show that the irreversibility of a massive object increases as its symmetry decreases: a disk exhibits an effective equilibrium dynamics, while a rod admits distinct translational and rotational temperatures, and a wedge is fully out of equilibrium. Conversely, this departure from equilibrium can be read in the universal far-field currents and density modulations of the bath, which we measure numerically and derive analytically.</p>

            <h2>Infinite variety of thermodynamic speed limits with general activities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuna Nagayama, Kohei Yoshimura, Sosuke Ito</p>
            <p>Activity, which represents the kinetic property of dynamics, plays a central role in obtaining thermodynamic speed limits (TSLs). In this paper, we discuss a unified framework that provides the existing TSLs based on different activities such as dynamical activity and dynamical state mobility. We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks by using different activities defined by the generalized means. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.</p>

            <h2>Effect of disorder on the strain-tuned charge density wave multicriticality in Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$</h2>

            <p>We explore, through a combination of x-ray diffraction and elastoresistivity measurements, the effect of disorder on the strain-tuned charge density wave and associated multicriticality in Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.026). We focus particularly on the behavior near the strain-tuned bicritical point that occurs in pristine ErTe$_3$ (x=0). Our study reveals that while Pd intercalation somewhat broadens the signatures of the CDW phase transitions, the line of first-order transitions at which the CDW reorients as a function of applied strain persists in the presence of disorder and still seemingly terminates at a critical point. The critical point occurs at a lower temperature and a lower strain compared to pristine ErTe$_3$. Similarly, the nematic elastoresistance of Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$, though suppressed in magnitude and broadened relative to that of ErTe$_3$, has a markedly more symmetric response around the critical point. These observations point to disorder driving a reduction in the system's electronic orthorhombicity even while the material remains irrevocably orthorhombic due to the presence of a glide plane in the crystal structure. Disorder, it would appear, reinforces the emergence of a "pseudo-tetragonal" electronic response in this fundamentally orthorhombic material.</p>

            <p>Weyl fermions can arise from time-reversal symmetry-breaking magnetism, but their impact on magnetic order is a source of ongoing research. Using high-precision neutron diffraction and spectroscopy, we present a comprehensive exploration of the magnetic structure and excitation spectrum of Weyl semimetal and helical magnet NdAlSi. We use Luttinger-Tisza, classical mean-field, and random-phase approximation techniques to model the dispersive crystal field excitons. We find extended-ranged and sign-changing interactions, suggesting a coupling between conduction electrons and the local moments. We demonstrate that low-symmetry anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, in contrast with higher-symmetry interactions enabled by Weyl fermions, play an important role in stabilizing the complex spin spiral ground state of NdAlSi. Our work provides a first detailed view of microscopic interactions in a Weyl magnet, and constrains the role of Weyl electrons and their chirality on the spiral magnetism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wuzhang Fang, Edward Schwartz, Alexey A. Kovalev, K. D. Belashchenko</p>
            <p>Field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization has been observed in an epitaxial L1$_1$-ordered CoPt/CuPt bilayer and attributed to spin-orbit torque (SOT) arising from the crystallographic $3m$ point group of the interface. Using a first-principles nonequilibrium Green's function formalism combined with the Anderson disorder model, we calculate the angular dependence of the SOT in a CoPt/CuPt bilayer and find that the magnitude of the $3m$ SOT is about 20% of the conventional dampinglike SOT. We further study the magnetization dynamics in perpendicularly magnetized films in the presence of $3m$ SOT and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, using the equations of motion for domain wall dynamics and micromagnetic simulations. We find that for systems with strong interfacial DMI characterized by the Néel character of domain walls, a very large current density is required to achieve deterministic switching because reorientation of the magnetization inside the domain wall is necessary to induce the switching asymmetry. For thicker films with relatively weak interfacial DMI and the Bloch character of domain walls the deterministic switching with much smaller currents is possible, which agrees with recent experimental findings.</p>

            <h2>Response of superfluid fermions at finite temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumit Bhattacharjee, Elena Litvinova</p>
            <p>A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-enforced minimal entanglement and correlation in quantum spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kangle Li, Liujun Zou</p>
            <p>The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive integer. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\min\{ -\frac{2}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), 2\ln(J+1) \}$, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open chain with such symmetries, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\min\{ -\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), \ln(J+1) \}$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the symmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we show that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a vanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal entanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.</p>

            <h2>The Smearing of Quasi-Particles: Signatures in the Entanglement Entropy of Excited Many-Particle Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jagannath Sutradhar, Jonathan Ruhman, Avraham Klein, Dimitri Gutman, Richard Berkovits</p>
            <p>The entanglement spectrum serves as a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems, revealing key information about symmetry, topology, and excitations. While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Lorentz Transformation of the Energy Spectrum of the Equilibrium State of Massive Free Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruohan Xu, Tingzhang Shi, H. T. Quan</p>
            <p>In previous studies of relativistic thermodynamics, the temperature of a static system, as perceived by a moving observer, has traditionally been treated as a scalar. This assumption has also been extended to the research on the cosmic microwave background. However, the validity of this assumption is a consequence of the massless nature of photons. More generally, when an observer is in relative motion to a system, the thermal equilibrium state is characterized by a four-vector temperature. In this paper, we study the non-interacting massive Bosonic and Fermionic field systems. We derive the Lorentz transformation of the energy spectral density in the equilibrium state of these fields. In the massless limit for bosonic field, our results recover the transformation of black body radiation [G. W. Ford and R. F. O' Connell., Phys. Rev. E, 88, 044101(2013)], which corresponds to a scalar temperature with dipole anisotropy. For the massive fields, the moving equilibrium state cannot be characterized by a corresponding scalar temperature. This result shows the necessity of introducing four-vector temperature in relativistic thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Universality of Top Rank Statistics for Brownian Reshuffling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zdzislaw Burda, Mario Kieburg</p>
            <p>We study the dynamical aspects of the top rank statistics of particles, performing Brownian motions on a half-line, which are ranked by their distance from the origin. For this purpose, we introduce an observable that we call the overlap ratio $\Omega(t)$, whose average is the probability that a particle that is on the top-$n$ list at some time will also be on the top-$n$ list after time $t$. The overlap ratio is a local observable which is concentrated at the top of the ranking and does not require the full ranking of all particles. It is simple to measure in practice. We derive an analytical formula for the average overlap ratio for a system of $N$ particles in the stationary state that undergo independent Brownian motion on the positive real half-axis with a reflecting wall at the origin and a drift towards the wall. In particular, we show that for $N\rightarrow \infty$, the overlap ratio takes a rather simple form $\langle \Omega(t)\rangle = {\rm erfc}(a \sqrt{t})$ for $n\gg 1$ with some scaling parameter $a>0$. This result is a very good approximation even for moderate sizes of the top-$n$ list such as $n=10$. Moreover, as we show, the overlap ratio exhibits universal behavior observed in many dynamical systems including geometric Brownian motion, Brownian motion with a position-dependent drift and a soft barrier on one side, the Bouchaud-Mézard wealth distribution model, and Kesten processes.</p>

            <p>High-pressure synthesis can be an effective method for improving the sample quality of materials as well as their superconducting properties. In this paper, the synthesis process of F- doped SmFeAsO has been optimized by preparing a series of bulk SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm1111) using the high gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method, considering various growth parameters like growth pressures (0-1 GPa) and heating time (0.5-2 h). Structural, microstructural, Raman spectroscopic, transport, and magnetic measurements are employed to comprehensively analyze these bulks and derive the conclusive findings. The parent SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 prepared by the conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP) has a transition temperature (Tc) of around 53-54 K, and the critical current density (Jc) of 103 A/cm2 at 5 K with a small amount of the impurity phases (SmOF and SmAs), consistent with previous reports. Interestingly, all bulks synthesized by HP-HTS have almost the same Tc and Jc as the parent sample. The optimal growth conditions are obtained as 900C, 1 hour, and 0.5 GPa with the sealed Ta-tube, which slightly improved the sample quality and the superconducting properties compared to other bulks grown by HP-HTS. Our study confirms that the existence of the impurity phases in the 1111 family is very robust and cannot be reduced by HP-HTS, leading to only a small variation in the observed superconducting properties of Sm1111 whether prepared by CSP or HP-HTS. This is the first comprehensive investigation of the high-pressure development of Sm1111, which shows distinct behaviour from other families of iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <p>We present a {\it numerically exact} study of the Hubbard model with spin-dependent anisotropic hopping on the square lattice using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. At half-filling, the system undergoes Ising phase transitions upon cooling, leading to the formation of Ising-type antiferromagnetic order for repulsive interactions and charge density wave order for attractive interactions at finite temperatures. By elegantly implementing the sign-problem-free condition and Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations, we achieve significant improvements in precision control of the numerical calculations, and obtain highly accurate results of the transition temperatures from weak to strong interactions across representative anisotropies. We further characterize the system by examining the temperature dependence of various thermodynamic properties, including the energy, double occupancy, specific heat and charge susceptibility. Specifically, we provide unbiased numerical results of the entropy map on temperature-interaction plane, the critical entropy, and the spin, singlon and doublon correlations, all of which are directly measurable in optical lattice experiments. Away from half-filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and investigate the possible emergence of stripe spin-density wave order in the system with repulsive interaction.</p>

            <p>Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</p>

The connection of the trimeron arrangement with site-selective doping of magnetite is discussed.

            <h2>Unsupervised Classification of Non-Hermitian Topological Phases under Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Long, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang</p>
            <p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into fundamental science has opened new possibilities to address long-standing scientific challenges rooted in mathematical limitations. For example, topological invariants are used to characterize topology, but there is no universally applicable one. This limitation explains why, in the past decades-long classification of topological phases of matter -- mainly focused on Hermitian systems -- many phases initially classified ``trivial" were later identified as topological. Recently, the discovery of non-Hermitian band topology has spurred substantial efforts in non-Hermitian topological classification, including the development of new topological invariants. However, such classifications similarly risk overlooking key topological features. Here, without relying on any topological invariant, we develop an AI-based unsupervised classification of symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases. This algorithm distinguishes topological differences among non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with symmetries, and constructs, in an unsupervised manner, a topological periodic table for non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, it can account for the boundary effects, enabling the exploration of open-boundary effects on the topological phase diagram. These results introduce an unsupervised approach for classifying symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases without omission and provide valuable guidance for the development of theories and experiments.</p>

            <p>Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.</p>

Employing Jordan-Wigner transformation and effective perturbative theory to transform the Hamiltonian into fermionic quadratic form, the Berry curvature is calculated by choosing the effective magnetic field as the parameter, and we find that the xy-component of the Berry curvature has the same behavior around the critical lines with the phase diagram and the behavior of Berry curvature around the critical line will not be influenced by local perturbation, i.e. it has the robustness against the local perturbation. Especially, we relate the Berry curvature with the derivative of effective magnetic susceptibility which can be regarded as the signature of topological phase transition besides, we related the second nonlinear susceptibility with the non-Abelian Berry connection. Then we analytically calculate the generalized Berry curvature in the mixed state called mean Uhlmann curvature which can be related with the spectral function, the curves that mean Uhlmanncurvaturechangingtemperaturewithdifferentcouplingconstant reveal that it will have an extrema when adjust $J_x$ from $A$ phase to $B$ phase. At last we analytically calculate the quantum geometric tensor in the effective magnetic field space whose imaginary part is the Berry curvature and real part is the Fubini-Study metric, and we find that the zz-component of Fubini-Study metric and the phase diagram are highly correlated which will peak at the cross point of three phases, then the Fubini-Study metric is extended to the finite temperature with arising an additional term called Fisher-Rao metric caused by mixed state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heng Wu, Yaojia Wang, Mazhar N. Ali</p>
            <p>Superconductivity has been investigated for over a century, but there are still open questions about what determines the critical current; the maximum current a superconductor can carry before switching to its normal state. For a given superconductor, the zero-field critical current is widely believed to be determined by its inherent properties and be related to its critical magnetic field. Here, by studying superconducting polycrystalline films, single crystal flakes, and layered heterostructures, we find that the critical current of a superconductor can vary with measurement configuration. It can be influenced, or even determined, by adjacent superconducting segments along the applied current trajectory, whereas the critical magnetic field and critical temperature remain unaffected. This global critical current effect both reveals the need to revisit fundamental theory describing superconductivity, as well as implies that superconductors can transfer critical current related properties to each other. We demonstrate this by designing and fabricating a simple superconducting structure that transferred a superconducting diode effect from one segment to another segment which could not manifest the effect on its own. This observation merits a reconsideration of contemporary superconducting circuit design, and developing a full understanding will lead to a new paradigm of superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p>The spin-12 three-leg antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder is studied under open boundary condition (OBC) and cylinder boundary condition (CBC), using the density matrix renormalization group and matrix product state methods, respectively. Specifically, we calculate the energy density, entanglement entropy, and concurrence while discussing the effects of interleg interaction J2 and the alternating coupling parameter gamma on these quantities. It is found that the introduction of gamma can completely reverse the concurrence distribution between odd and even bonds. Under CBC, the generation of the interleg concurrence is inhibited when gamma=0, and the introduction of gamma can cause interleg concurrence between chains 1 and 3, in which the behavior is more complicated due to the competition between CBC and gamma. Additionally, we find that gamma induces two types of long-distance entanglement (LDE) in the system under OBC: intraleg LDE and inter-leg one. When the system size is sufficiently large, both types of LDE reach similar strength and stabilize at a constant value. The study indicates that the three-leg ladder makes it easier to generate LDE compared with the two-leg system. However, the generation of LDE is inhibited under CBC which the spin frustration exists. In addition, the calculated results of energy, entanglement entropy and concurrence all show that there are essential relations between these quantities and phase transitions of the system. Further, we predict a phase transition point near gamma=0.54 under OBC. The present study provides valuable insights into understanding the phase diagram of this class of systems.</p>

We discover that due to their symmetry that depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe and FeS bilayers as candidate devices. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism and potential applications.</p>

            <p>The long sought cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen (cg-N) consisting of N-N single bonds has been synthesized by a simple route using sodium azide as a precursor at ambient conditions. The recrystallization process was designed to expose crystal faces with low activation energy that facilitates initiating the polymeric reaction at ambient conditions. The azide was considered as a precursor due to the low energy barrier in transforming double bonded N=N to single bonded cg-N. Raman spectrum measurements detected the emerging vibron peaks at 635 cm-1 for the polymerized sodium azide samples, demonstrating the formation of cg-N with N-N single bonds. Different from traditional high pressure technique and recently developed plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method, the route achieves the quantitative synthesis of cg-N at ambient conditions. The simple method to synthesize cg-N offers potential for further scale up production as well as practical applications of polymeric nitrogen based materials as high energy density materials.</p>

            <p>The wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys is very poor due to their inherent low hardness and poor tribological properties. Improving the wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys plays a significant role in expanding their application range. Various surface treatments have been used to produce protective coatings or layers for solving this problem. In this work, the Mg(OH)2 layer with a thickness about 25 microns was directly formed on AZ91magnesium alloy by oxidizing in superheated water vapor. SEM and XRD were employed to characterize the microstructure and phase composition of oxidized layer. The effect of oxidized layer on the friction and wear properties of magnesium alloy against the bearing steel ball were evaluated by using a reciprocating friction and wear test apparatus. The results showed that layer exhibited low friction coefficients and extremely small wear loss compared to the untreated substrate.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Reynoso, G. Usaj, C.A. Balseiro</p>
            <p>During the last years there has been much interest, and theoretical discussion, about the possibility to use spin-orbit coupling to control the carriers spins in two-dimensional semiconducting heterostructures. Spin polarization at the sample edges may occur as the response of systems with strong SO-coupling to an external transport current, an effect known as spin Hall effect. Here, we show that in a 2DEG with Rashba SO-coupling, spin polarization near the sample edge can develop kinematically for low electron densities. We also discuss the effect in quantum wires where lateral confinement plays an important role.</p>

            <h2>Atomistic modeling of the structure and diffusion processes at Al(110)/Si(001) interphase boundaries obtained by vapor deposition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Yuri Mishin</p>
            <p>We report on molecular dynamics simulations of the atomic structure and diffusion processes at Al(110)/Si(001) interphase boundary created by simulated vapor deposition of Al(Si) alloy onto Si(001) substrate. An array of parallel misfit dislocations of both full and partial types is observed at the interface. Si atoms segregate to the misfit dislocations, with segregation to full dislocations being stronger. The interface diffusion is dominated by short-circuit diffusion along the misfit dislocations, creating a significant diffusion anisotropy. Diffusion of Al and Si atoms along the full misfit dislocations is faster than along the partial misfit dislocations. Due to the presence of the misfit dislocations, diffusion at the Al(110)/Si(001) interface studied here is faster than diffusion at the Al(111)/Si(111) interfaces investigated in our previous work.</p>

            <p>Materials manifesting the Kitaev model, characterized by bond-dependent interactions on a honeycomb lattice, can host exotic phenomena like quantum spin liquid states and topological magnetic excitations. However, finding such materials remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering measurements performed on VI3, a van der Waals ferromagnetic Mott insulator, covering a wide range of reciprocal space. Our measurements unveil highly anisotropic magnetic excitations in momentum space. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis of various models that incorporate diverse symmetry-allowed magnetic interactions, we find the observed excitations are well captured by a model with a large bond-dependent Kitaev interaction. These results not only help to understand the intriguing properties of VI3, such as the pronounced anomalous thermal Hall effects and strong pressure/structure dependence of magnetism, but also open a new avenue for exploring Kitaev physics.</p>

            <p>Magnetic materials phase reconstruction from Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements has traditionally been achieved using longstanding methods such as off-axis holography (OAH) and the transport-of-intensity equation (TIE). Amidst the increase in access to processing power and the development of advanced algorithms, phase retrieval of nanoscale magnetic materials with higher fidelity and resolution, potentially down to the few nanometer limit, becomes possible. Specifically, reverse-mode automatic differentiation (RMAD) and the extended electron ptychography iterative engine (ePIE) are two methods that have been utilized for high confidence phase reconstructions using LTEM through-focal series imaging and Lorentz scanning TEM (Ltz-4D-STEM), respectively. This work evaluates phase retrieval using TIE, RMAD, and ePIE in simulations consisting of an array of Permalloy (Ni80Fe20) nanoscale islands. Extending beyond simulations, we demonstrate total phase reconstructions of a NiFe nanowire using OAH and RMAD in LTEM and ePIE in Ltz-4D-STEM experiments and determine the magnetization saturation through corroborations with micromagnetic simulations. Finally, we show how the total phase shift gradient can be utilized to observe and characterize the proximity effects emanating from neighboring magnetic island interactions and an isolated NiFe nanowire.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiguang Liao, Yiming Wang, Lei Chen, Guijing Duan, Rong Yu, Qimiao Si</p>
            <p>Motivated by the high temperature superconductivity observed in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the spectroscopic evidences of strong electron correlations in this compound, we address the role of its multiorbital electron correlations by proposing a global phase diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. We find a Mott transition developing at half filling, and identify strong orbital selectivity when the system is at the physical electron count. The orbital selectivity is manifested in the formation of interlayer spin singlets between electrons in the $z^2$ orbitals. These features lead to a strong renormalization of the electronic band structure while sustaining a sizable splitting between the bonding and antibonding $z^2$ bands. The proposed orbital-selective correlations naturally explain a series of features as observed in the angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and optical conductivity measurements in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our results provide a basis to understand both the normal state and the high temperature superconductivity of multilayer nickelates and thereby elucidate correlated superconductivity in general.</p>

            <p>We study how spatiotemporal chaos in dynamical systems can be controlled by stochastically returning them to their initial conditions. Focusing on discrete nonlinear maps, we analyze how key measures of chaos -- the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, which quantify sensitivity to initial perturbations and the ballistic spread of information, respectively -- are reduced by stochastic resetting. We identify a critical resetting rate that induces a dynamical phase transition, characterized by the simultaneous vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, effectively arresting the spread of information. These theoretical predictions are validated and illustrated with numerical simulations of the celebrated logistic map and its lattice extension. Beyond discrete maps, our findings offer insights applicable to a broad class of extended classical interacting systems.</p>

            <p>Vacancy-cluster color centers in lithium fluoride have been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally for over a century, giving rise to various applications in solid-state lasers, broadband photonic devices, and radiation dosimeters. These color centers are also attractive candidate platforms for applications in quantum information science, due to their spin properties and strong coupling to the crystal lattice, which allows their properties to be easily tuned. Here we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect. Our work establishes the accuracy of the computationally lightweight hybrid-functional approach for predicting the optical and energetic properties of color centers in polar materials.</p>

            <p>The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect arises from strong electron correlations in a quantising magnetic field, and features exotic emergent phenomena such as electron fractionalisation. Using the diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach with the combinatorial summation algorithm, we obtain results with controlled accuracy for the microscopic model of interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level. As the temperature is lowered, we study the development and emergence of the incompressible 1/3-filled FQH state. By analysing the long-time decay of the Green's function, we find spectral properties consistent with an energy gap near 1/3-filling, while at half-filling an anomalous power law scaling is observed for short-range interaction screening, indicative of a non-Fermi liquid metal. Our work provides the first demonstration that fractionalised phases of matter can be reliably described with Feynman's diagrammatic technique in terms of the fundamental electronic degrees of freedom, while also showing applicability of expansions in the bare Coulomb potential for precision calculations.</p>

            <p>The phase ordering kinetics of emergent orders in correlated electron systems is a fundamental topic in non-equilibrium physics, yet it remains largely unexplored. The intricate interplay between quasiparticles and emergent order-parameter fields could lead to unusual coarsening dynamics that is beyond the standard theories. However, accurate treatment of both quasiparticles and collective degrees of freedom is a multi-scale challenge in dynamical simulations of correlated electrons. Here we leverage modern machine learning (ML) methods to achieve a linear-scaling algorithm for simulating the coarsening of charge density waves (CDWs), one of the fundamental symmetry breaking phases in functional electron materials. We demonstrate our approach on the square-lattice Hubbard-Holstein model and uncover an intriguing enhancement of CDW coarsening which is related to the screening of on-site potential by electron-electron interactions. Our study provides fresh insights into the role of electron correlations in non-equilibrium dynamics and underscores the promise of ML force-field approaches for advancing multi-scale dynamical modeling of correlated electron systems.</p>

However, evaluating electron, ion, and phonon transport properties and comprehending their mechanism remains challenging due to the difficulty in oxyhydride synthesis involving the trade-off between achieving density sintering and preventing hydrogen evolution. High-temperature treatments, often required to reduce intergranular resistance, typically cause hydrogen evolution before sufficient sintering. Instead of a post-annealing process aiming for strong chemical connections between oxyhydride particles, this research demonstrates a novel synthesis technique that converts pre-sintered bulk oxides into oxyhydrides while preserving the dense state. The process employs a high-pressure diffusion control method, facilitating the co-diffusion of hydride and oxide ions.</p>

We use first-principles density functional theory with a hybrid functional to investigate several features that are key for its use in heterostructures. First, for the purposes of growing wz-LaN on a substrate or designing a heterostructure, we show that it can be lattice-matched with a number of cubic materials along their [111] axes. We also evaluate the bound charge at such interfaces, taking into account both the polarization discontinuity and the piezoelectric polarization due to pseudomorphic strain. Second, we investigate band alignments and assess the results for interfaces with zincblende-, rocksalt-, and perovskite-structure compounds, and with chemically similar wurtzite and rocksalt nitrides.

However, achieving epitaxial growth of NSNO perovskite and RP phase films in a sputtering system is challenging compared to pulsed laser deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, due to the difficulty in stabilizing nickel oxidation states and minimizing structural defects. Here, we used an off-axis radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering to fabricate epitaxial NSNO perovskite and RP phase thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates, systematically controlling the growth temperatures. We investigated the thermal stability of the perovskite phase and the structural and electronic characteristics of the RP phase films. These findings provide valuable insights into the synthesis of nickelate RP phase films using RF magnetron sputtering, paving the way for scalable thin films fabrication technologies.</p>

            <p>The mutual feedback between quantum condensed matter and cold atom physics has been quite fruitful throughout history and continues to inspire ongoing research. Motivated by the recent activities on the quantum simulation of topological orders among the ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, we consider the possibility of searching for topological orders among the dipolar quantum magnets and polar molecules with a kagomé lattice geometry. Together with other quantum interactions such as the transverse field, the dipolar interaction endows the kagomé system with a similar structure as the Balents-Fisher-Girvin model and thus fosters the emergence of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders. We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory to access the topological ordered phase and describe the spinon and vison excitations for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders. We explain the spectroscopic consequences for various quantum phases as well as the experimental detection. We further discuss the rare-earth kagomé magnets, ultracold polar molecules, and cluster Mott insulators for the physical realization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Berx, Prashant Singh, Karel Proesmans</p>
            <p>Individual components such as cells, particles, or agents within a larger system often require detailed understanding of their relative position to act accordingly, enabling the system as a whole to function in an organised and efficient manner. Through the concept of positional information, such components are able to specify their position in order to, e.g., create robust spatial patterns or coordinate specific functionality. Such complex behaviour generally occurs far from thermodynamic equilibrium and thus requires the dissipation of free energy to sustain functionality. We show that in boundary-driven simple exclusion systems with position-dependent Langmuir kinetics, non-trivial Pareto-optimal trade-offs exist between the positional information, rescaled entropy production rate and global reaction current. Phase transitions in the optimal protocols that tune the densities of the system boundaries emerge as a result, showing that distinct protocols are able to exchange global optimality similar to phase coexistence in liquid-gas phase transitions, and that increasing the positional information can lead to diminishing returns when considering increased dissipation.</p>

However, dislocation density controls the scaling of the power law truncation in avalanche statistics and triggering stress at the origin of plastic events. The correlation between the activities of slip systems is highlighted. Our quantitative data can provide explanations for some experimental observations and help link the mesoscopic plasticity picture to larger-scale models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arya Bangun, Oleh Melnyk, Benjamin März</p>
            <p>We investigate the eigenstructure of matrix formulations used for modeling scattering processes in materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Considering dynamical scattering is fundamental in describing the interaction between an electron wave and the material under investigation. In TEM, both the Bloch wave formulation and the multislice method are commonly employed to model the scattering process, but comparing these models directly is challenging. Unlike the Bloch wave formulation, which represents the transmission function in terms of the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method does not have a pure transmission function due to the entanglement between electron waves and the propagation function within the crystal. To address this, we propose a reformulation of the multislice method into a matrix framework, which we refer to as transmission matrix. This enables a direct comparison to the well-known scattering matrix, derived from the Bloch wave formulation, and analysis of their eigenstructures. We show theoretically that both matrices are equal, under the condition that the angles of the eigenvalues differ no more than modulo $2\pi n$ for integer $n$, and the eigenvectors of the transmission and scattering matrix are related in terms of a two-dimensional Fourier matrix. The characterization of both matrices in terms of physical parameters, such as total projected potentials, is also discussed, and we perform numerical simulations to validate our theoretical findings. Finally, we show that the determinant of the transmission matrix can be used to estimate the mean inner potential.</p>

            <p>Anyons are low-dimensional quasiparticles that obey fractional statistics, hence interpolating between bosons and fermions. In two dimensions, they exist as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall states and they are believed to enable topological quantum computing. One-dimensional (1D) anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult. Here, we observe anyonic correlations, which emerge through the phenomenon of spin-charge separation, in a 1D strongly-interacting quantum gas. The required spin degree of freedom is provided by a mobile impurity, whose effective anyonic correlations are associated with an experimentally tunable statistical angle. These anyonic correlations are measured by monitoring the impurity momentum distribution, whose asymmetric feature demonstrates the transmutation of bosons via anyons to fermions. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we study the dynamical properties of the anyonic correlations via dynamical fermionization of the anyons. Our work opens up the door to the exploration of non-equilibrium anyonic phenomena in a highly controllable setting.</p>

Here, we report the first experimental observation of magnetization plateaux at 1/5 and 1/3 of the saturation value via thermal transport and magnetostriction measurements in YbAlO3. We present a phenomenological theory of the plateau states that describes them as islands of commensurability within an otherwise incommensurate LSDW phase and explains their relative positions within the LSDW phase and their relative extent in a magnetic field. Notably, the plateaux are stabilised by ferromagnetic interchain interactions in YbAlO3 and consistently are absent in other quasi-1D magnets such as BaCo2V2O8 with antiferromagnetic interchain interactions. We also report a sharp, step-like increase of the magnetostriction coefficient, indicating a phase transition of unknown origin in the high-field phase just below the saturation.</p>

            <p>Layered nickelates are believed to exhibit superconductivity similar to that found in the cuprates. However, the precise crystal structure of the superconducting phase of the layered nickelates has not been fully clarified. Here, I use first principles calculations to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in the single-layer-trilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, which is one member of the layered nickelates family that also shows signatures of superconductivity. I find a nearly dispersionless nondegenerate phonon branch in the parent $P4/mmm$ phase that is unstable along the Brillouin zone edge $M$ $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$ $\rightarrow$ $A$ $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ at all investigated pressures up to 30 GPa. Calculations show additional doubly-degenerate instabilities along the edge $MA$ at lower pressures. I used group-theoretical analysis to identify the distinct low-symmetry distortions possible due to these instabilities and generated them using the eigenvectors of the unstable modes. Structural relaxations show that the lowest energy structures at 0 and 10 GPa involve condensation of both the nondegenerate and doubly-degenerate instabilities, which is in contrast to the experimental refinements that involve condensation of only the doubly-degenerate branch. I also find that structural distortions are energetically favorable at 20 GPa, contrary to the experiments that do not observe any distortions of the parent $P4/mmm$ structure at high pressures.</p>

            <p>The bulk phase of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) has long been a subject of extensive investigation due to their utility as coating materials, electrocatalysts, and diffusion barriers, attributed to their high conductivity and refractory properties. Downscaling TMNs into two-dimensional (2D) forms would provide valuable members to the existing 2D materials repertoire, with potential enhancements across various applications. Moreover, calculations have anticipated the emergence of uncommon physical phenomena in TMNs at the 2D limit. In this study, we use the atomic substitution approach to synthesize 2D W5N6 with tunable thicknesses from tens of nanometers down to 2.9 nm. The obtained flakes exhibit high crystallinity and smooth surfaces. Electrical measurements on 15 samples show an average electrical conductivity of 161.1 S/cm, which persists while thickness decreases from 45.6 nm to 2.9 nm. The observed weak gate tuning effect suggests the semimetallic nature of the synthesized 2D W5N6. Further investigation into the conversion mechanism elucidates the crucial role of chalcogen vacancies in the precursor for initiating the reaction and strain in propagating the conversion. Our work introduces a desired semimetallic crystal to the 2D material library with mechanistic insights for future design of the synthesis.</p>

            <p>Simple local interactions can cause primitive building blocks to self-assemble into complex and functional patterns. However, even for a small number of blocks, there exist a vast number of possible configurations that are plausible, stable, and with varying degree of order. The ability to dynamically shift between multi-stable patterns (i.e., reprogram the self-assembly) entails navigating an intractable search space, which remains a challenge. In this paper, we engineer the self-assembly of macroscopic magnetic particles to create metamaterials with dynamically reversible emergent phases. We utilize a boundary composed of magnetic hinges to confine free-floating magnetic disks into different stable assemblies. We exploit the non-destructive nature of the magnetic boundaries to create re-programmable two-dimensional metamaterials that morphs from crystalline to quasi-crystalline to disordered assembly using the same number of disks and boundary. Furthermore, we explore their utility to control the propagation of sound waves in an effectively undamped media with rich nonlinearities. Our findings can expand the metamaterials horizon into functional and tunable devices.</p>

            <p>Dynamic magnetic response in a trilayered structure with non-equivalent layers (ABA type) has been studied with Monte Carlo simulation using Metropolis algorithm. In each layer, ferromagnetic (FM) nearest neighbour Ising interactions are present along with antiferromagnetic (AFM) nearest neighbour coupling across different layers. The system is studied under a harmonically oscillating external magnetic field. It is revealed that along with dynamic phase transition (DPT), compensation phenomenon emerges in this system under dynamic scenario too. This feature in dynamic case is unique for such trilayered systems only, in contrast to the bulk system reported earlier. The temporal behaviour of the magnetisation of each individual layer shows that different magnetic response of the non-equivalent layers results into such dynamic compensation phenomenon. The difference in response also results into warping of the dynamic hysteresis loops, under various external parameter values, such as amplitude of the oscillating field and temperature.</p>

            <h2>Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haifeng Tang, Shreya Vardhan, Jinzhao Wang</p>
            <p>We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times. Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.</p>

            <h2>The quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism: the role of boundary conditions, endpoints and kink types</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Soto Garcia, Natalia Chepiga</p>
            <p>Quantum phase transitions are characterised by the universal scaling laws in the critical region surrounding the transitions. This universality is also manifested in the critical real-time dynamics through the quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In recent experiments on a Rydberg atom quantum simulator, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism has been used to probe the nature of quantum phase transitions. In this paper we analyze the caveats associated with this method and develop strategies to improve its accuracy. Focusing on two minimal models -- transverse-field Ising and three-state Potts -- we study the effect of boundary conditions, the location of the endpoints and some subtleties in the definition of the kink operators. In particular, we show that the critical scaling of the most intuitive types of kinks is extremely sensitive to the correct choice of endpoint, while more advanced types of kinks exhibit remarkably robust universal scaling. Furthermore, we show that when kinks are tracked over the entire chain, fixed boundary conditions improve the accuracy of the scaling. Surprisingly, the Kibble-Zurek critical scaling appears to be equally accurate whether the fixed boundary conditions are chosen to be symmetric or anti-symmetric. Finally, we show that the density of kinks extracted in the central part of long chains obeys the predicted universal scaling for all types of boundary conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krishna Shende, Matreyee Kandpal, Arvind, Kavita Dorai</p>
            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <h2>Continuous and Reversible Electrical Tuning of Fluorescent Decay Rate via Fano Resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emre Ozan Polat, Zafer Artvin, Yusuf Şaki, Alpan Bek, Ramazan Sahin</p>
            <p>Decay rate of an atomic or molecular dipole depends on the local density of optical states (LDOS) -- Purcell effect -- which can significantly be enhanced near a dielectric-core metal-shell nanoparticle (CSNP). On top of that, an auxiliary quantum object (QO) can introduce a Fano transparency in the plasmonic spectrum of the CSNP. Here, we show that an auxiliary QO, located at the hotspot of the CSNP, can modify the LDOS, hence the decay rate of an excited dipole. Moreover, by controlling the resonance of the auxiliary QO via an applied voltage, one can continuously and reversibly tune both the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the dipole up to 2 orders-of-magnitude. This phenomenon emerges as an invaluable tool to implement in integrated quantum technologies, enabling realization of on-demand entanglement/single-photon sources, controlled execution of quantum gates and electrical-control of superradiant-like phase transitions. It also bears potential for application in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</p>

            <h2>An analytic theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mason Kamb, Surya Ganguli</p>
            <p>We obtain the first analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-based diffusion models can generate highly creative images that lie far from their training data. But optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching; (2) result in a fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, equivariant local score (ELS) machine that, (3) without any training can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and UNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.90, 0.91, 0.94$ on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and MNIST). Our ELS machine reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic model of creativity, in which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local training set patches in different image locations. Our theory also partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled UNets (median $r^2 \sim 0.75$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role for attention in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.</p>

            <h2>Emittance Minimization for Aberration Correction II: Physics-informed Bayesian Optimization of an Electron Microscope</h2>

            <p>Aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has become an essential tool in understanding materials at the atomic scale. However, tuning the aberration corrector to produce a sub-Ångström probe is a complex and time-costly procedure, largely due to the difficulty of precisely measuring the optical state of the system. When measurements are both costly and noisy, Bayesian methods provide rapid and efficient optimization. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach to fully automate the process by minimizing a new quality metric, beam emittance, which is shown to be equivalent to performing aberration correction. In part I, we derived several important properties of the beam emittance metric and trained a deep neural network to predict beam emittance growth from a single Ronchigram. Here we use this as the black box function for Bayesian Optimization and demonstrate automated tuning of simulated and real electron microscopes. We explore different surrogate functions for the Bayesian optimizer and implement a deep neural network kernel to effectively learn the interactions between different control channels without the need to explicitly measure a full set of aberration coefficients. Both simulation and experimental results show the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches by achieving a better optical state with a higher convergence rate.</p>

            <p>Precise alignment of the electron beam is critical for successful application of scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) to understanding materials at atomic level. Despite the success of aberration correctors, aberration correction is still a complex process. Here we approach aberration correction from the perspective of accelerator physics and show it is equivalent to minimizing the emittance growth of the beam, the span of the phase space distribution of the probe. We train a deep learning model to predict emittance growth from experimentally accessible Ronchigrams. Both simulation and experimental results show the model can capture the emittance variation with aberration coefficients accurately. We further demonstrate the model can act as a fast-executing function for the global optimization of the lens parameters. Our approach enables new ways to quickly quantify and automate aberration correction that takes advantage of the rapid measurements possible with high-speed electron cameras. In part II of the paper, we demonstrate how the emittance metric enables rapid online tuning of the aberration corrector using Bayesian optimization.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Phase Transitions in the Spin 1 Bilinear-Biquadratic Heisenberg Model Based on Classical and Quantum Correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ghader Najarbashi, Hassan Bahmani, Babak Tarighi</p>
            <p>We investigate thermal and nonthermal quantum correlations in the one dimensional spin 1 bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model. Using tools from quantum information theory such as generalized concurrence, negativity, and various measures of quantum, classical, and total correlations in bipartite states we demonstrate that these measures effectively identify quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at critical points. Our negativity analysis reveals nearly identical results at zero or very low temperatures. Importantly, we find that partial concurrence, defined with the reduced density matrix, detects more quantum critical points than total concurrence. Additionally, we argue that spin chains with an odd number of spins are more effective than those with an even number in identifying QPTs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianing Li, Weiyao Ke</p>
            <p>Transport properties of cold and dense nucleon matter are important for both nuclear and astrophysics but are relatively less studied than those at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta>0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</p>

We derive the linear scaling rule between the learning rate (step size) and the batch size, and identify universal and non-universal aspects of weight matrix dynamics.

            <h2>Cascading from $\mathscr{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory to Confinement and Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Adjoint QCD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric D'Hoker, Thomas T. Dumitrescu, Efrat Gerchkovitz, Emily Nardoni</p>
            <p>We argue that adjoint QCD in 3+1 dimensions, with any $SU(N)$ gauge group and two Weyl fermion flavors (i.e. one adjoint Dirac fermion), confines and spontaneously breaks its chiral symmetries via the condensation of a fermion bilinear. We flow to this theory from pure $\mathscr{N}=2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with the same gauge group, by giving a SUSY-breaking mass $M$ to the scalars in the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ vector multiplet. This flow can be analyzed rigorously at small $M$, where it leads to a deconfined vacuum at the origin of the $\mathscr{N}=2$ Coulomb branch. The analysis can be extended to all $M$ using an Abelian dual description that arises from the $N$ multi-monopole points of the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ theory. At each such point, there are $N-1$ hypermultiplet Higgs fields $h_m^{i = 1, 2}$, which are $SU(2)_R$ doublets. We provide a detailed study of the phase diagram as a function of $M$, by analyzing the semi-classical phases of the dual using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques. The result is a cascade of first-order phase transitions, along which the Higgs fields $h_m^i$ successively turn on, and which interpolates between the Coulomb branch at small $M$, where all $h_m^i = 0$, and a maximal Higgs branch, where all $h_m^i \neq 0$, at sufficiently large $M$. We show that this maximal Higgs branch precisely matches the confining and chiral symmetry breaking phase of two-flavor adjoint QCD, including its broken and unbroken symmetries, its massless spectrum, and the expected large-$N$ scaling of various observables. The spontaneous breaking pattern $SU(2)_R \to U(1)_R$, consistent with the Vafa-Witten theorem, is ensured by an intricate alignment mechanism for the $h_m^i$ in the dual, and leads to a $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ sigma model of increasing radius along the cascade.</p>

            <h2>Universal hyper-scaling relations, power-law tails, and data analysis for strong anomalous diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Vollmer, Claudio Giberti, Jordan Orchard, Hannes Reinhard, Carlos Mejía-Monasterio, Lamberto Rondoni</p>
            <p>Strong anomalous diffusion is {often} characterized by a piecewise-linear spectrum of the moments of displacement. The spectrum is characterized by slopes $\xi$ and $\zeta$ for small and large moments, respectively, and by the critical moment $\alpha$ of the crossover. The exponents $\xi$ and $\zeta$ characterize the asymptotic scaling of the bulk and the tails of the probability distribution function of displacements, respectively. Here, we adopt asymptotic theory to match the behaviors at intermediate scales. The resulting constraint explains how distributions with algebraic tails imply strong anomalous diffusion, and it relates $\alpha$ to the corresponding power law. Our theory provides novel relations between exponents characterizing strong anomalous diffusion, and it yields explicit expressions for the leading-order corrections to the asymptotic power-law behavior of the moments of displacement. They provide the time scale that must be surpassed to clearly discriminate the leading-order power law from its sub-leading corrections. This insight allows us to point out sources of systematic errors in their numerical estimates. Rather than separately fitting an exponent for each moment we devise a robust scheme to determine $\xi$, $\zeta$ and $\alpha$. The findings are supported by numerical and analytical results on five different models exhibiting strong anomalous diffusion.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Bin Chen</p>
            <p>Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:https://doi.org/10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.</p>

            <h2>The Casimir Effect in (3+1)-dimensional lattice Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature: the unexpected universality of quarkiton and glueton boundary states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim N. Chernodub, Vladimir A. Goy, Alexander V. Molochkov, Konstantin R. Pak, Alexey S. Tanashkin</p>
            <p>In our earlier work on the Casimir effect in (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we identified two novel nonperturbative states arising in QCD with boundaries: the glueton and the quarkiton. The glueton, or "gluon exciton", is a colorless bound state formed by gluons interacting with their negatively colored images in a chromometallic mirror. The quarkiton, or "quark exciton", is a meson-like state comprising a heavy quark attracted to its image through the mirror. In this study, we extend our analysis to finite temperatures near the deconfinement phase transition $(T \approx 0.78 T_c)$, where we observe a linear potential between a color-neutral chromometallic mirror and a heavy test quark. Our result suggests that the quarkiton state can have a physical relevance since mirrors for photons and, presumably, gluons can be realized in field theories as domain-wall solutions. Furthermore, we find a striking universality: the ratio of the glueton mass to the bulk $0^{++}$ glueball mass - defining the bulk mass gap - matches the ratio of the quarkiton string tension to the string tension between quark and anti-quark in the absence of the mirror, with a value $\mathcal{R} = 0.294(11)$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuho Sekikawa, Hiroshi Watanabe</p>
            <p>The number of users on social media continues to increase during the growth phase. Still, eventually, the number of new users balances out the number of departing users, and the number of users becomes almost constant. To investigate how network properties change under these conditions, we study the aging behavior of the network. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barab'asi model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We defined $\alpha$ as the node deletion parameter and $\beta$ as the node addition parameter. The larger $\alpha$ yields, the higher the probability of deleting a node with a larger degree, and the larger $\beta$ yields, the higher the probability of connecting to a node with a larger degree and fitness. We found that the network cannot reach a steady state in some parameter regions. We investigated the degree distribution of the network that reached a steady state. The scale-free nature of the network broke down in regions where $\alpha$ is large and $\beta$ is small, and the degree distribution became exponential. We also performed percolation analyses. While the phase transition point was zero in the scale-free network, the phase transition point changed finitely in regions with large $\alpha$ and small $\beta$. The phase diagram of whether the degree distribution is power-law or exponential and whether the phase transition point of percolation is zero or finite exhibits a good agreement between the phase boundaries. This study is expected to help control network structure in mature networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Geiko</p>
            <p>There are families of physical systems that cannot be adiabatically evolved to the trivial system uniformly across the parameter space, even if each system in the family belongs to the trivial phase. The obstruction is measured by higher Berry class. We analyze families of topological systems in 1+1d using families of invertible TQFTs and families of RG fixed states of spin chains. We use the generalized matrix-product states to describe RG fixed points of all translation invariant pure splits states on spin chains. Families of such fixed points correspond to bundles of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. There exists a global MPS parametrization of the family if and only if the latter bundle is trivial. We propose a novel duality of parametrized topological phases which is an avatar of the T-duality in string theory. The duality relates families with different parameter spaces and different higher Berry classes. Mathematically, the T-duality is realized by gauging the circle action on the continuous trace algebra generated by parametrized matrix-product tensors.</p>

            <p>We study the surface code under the most general single-qubit $X$-error channel, encompassing both coherent and incoherent errors. We develop a statistical mechanics mapping for the decoding problem and represent the partition function as a transfer-matrix, i.e., a (1+1)$D$ hybrid quantum circuit. The relevant circuit evolution, as we show, has an efficient matrix product state approximation, using which we develop an algorithm for large-scale syndrome sampling, thus enabling the simulation of these non-Pauli errors away from the limits captured by previous methods. Using these results, we compute maximum-likelihood thresholds and show that error coherence has negligible influence away from the fully coherent limit. We also study how coherence impacts information-theoretic measures like the coherent information, which we show to require, for accurate threshold estimates, increasingly large codes upon increasing error coherence and to eventually break down in the fully coherent limit. To interpret the dominant effect of incoherent errors in large codes, we develop a phenomenological errorfield double field theory, which indicates the instability of coherent errors' above-threshold quasi-long-range order to the above-threshold disorder characteristic of bit-flip errors and the suppression of coherence in the logical noise channel.</p>

            <p>Any local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) has a corresponding "universal" relevant deformation that takes it to a gapped phase. This deformation preserves all continuous internal symmetries, $\mathcal{S}$, and therefore also preserves any 't Hooft anomalies supported purely in $\mathcal{S}$. We describe the resulting phase diagram in the case of SCFTs that arise as the endpoints of renormalization group flows from 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Abelian gauge theories with any number of $U(1)$ gauge group factors and arbitrary integer charges for the matter fields. We argue that the universal deformations take these QFTs to Abelian fractional quantum Hall states in the infrared (IR), and we explain how to match 't Hooft anomalies between the non-topological ultraviolet theories and the IR topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). Along the way, we give a proof that 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror symmetry of our Abelian gauge theories descends to a duality of these TQFTs. Finally, using our anomaly matching discussion, we describe how to connect, via the renormalization group, abstract local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs with certain 't Hooft anomalies for their internal symmetries to IR phases (partially) described by Abelian spin Chern-Simons theories.</p>

            <p>Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) ideal for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, and is highly successful for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). It has been observed that the optimal variational parameters obtained from one instance of a COP can be transferred to another instance, producing sufficiently satisfactory solutions for the latter. In this context, a suitable method for further improving the solution is to fine-tune a subset of the transferred parameters. We numerically explore the role of optimizing individual QAOA layers in improving the approximate solution of the Max-Cut problem after parameter transfer. We also investigate the trade-off between a good approximation and the required optimization time when optimizing transferred QAOA parameters. These studies show that optimizing a subset of layers can be more effective at a lower time-cost compared to optimizing all layers.</p>

            <p>To make efficient use of limited physical resources, the brain must match its coding and computational strategies to the statistical structure of input signals. An attractive testing ground for these principles is the problem of motion estimation in the fly visual system: we understand the optics of the compound eye, have a quantitative description of input signals and noise from the retina, and can record from output neurons that encode estimates of different velocity components. Furthermore, recent work provides a nearly complete wiring diagram of the intervening circuitry. What is missing is a characterization of the visual signals and motions that flies encounter in a natural context. We attack this directly with the development of a specialized camera that matches the high temporal resolution, optical properties, and spectral sensitivity of the fly's eye; inertial motion sensors provide ground truth about rotations and translations through the world. We describe the design, construction, and performance characteristics of this FlEye camera. To illustrate the opportunities created by this instrument we use data on movies and motion to construct optimal local motion estimators that can be compared with the responses of the fly's motion sensitive neurons.</p>

This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational EFT for dissipative open systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pak Hang Chris Lau, Kanji Nishii, Toshifumi Noumi</p>
            <p>We elaborate on the effective field theory (EFT) construction for dissipative open systems coupled to dynamical gravity, in light of recent developments on the EFT of dissipative hydrodynamics (HydroEFT). Our construction is based on the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its symmetries as well as microscopic unitarity. A key aspect of dynamical gravity is that gravity couples to all degrees of freedom universally, hence the EFT has to take into account the energy-momentum tensor of the environment to which the energy escapes from the dissipative system of interest. We incorporate this effect by modeling the environment based on HydroEFT, assuming validity of the derivative expansion of the environment sector. For illustration, we apply our EFT recipe to a dissipative scalar field coupled to dynamical gravity that can be used, e.g., for dissipative inflation. In particular we quantify impacts of fluctuations in the environment sector on the scalar dynamics. We also apply the same framework to dissipative gravity, discussing dissipative gravitational waves and the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Particle-Soliton Degeneracy in 2D Quantum Chromodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clay Cordova, Diego García-Sepúlveda, Nicholas Holfester</p>
            <p>Quantum chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions admits a finite non-invertible symmetry described mathematically by a fusion category. This symmetry is spontaneously broken at long distances, leading to distinct vacua. When the theory has a mass gap, the spectrum is therefore characterized by particle excitations above a single vacuum and soliton sectors interpolating between vacua. We use anyon condensation and the representation theory of fusion categories to obtain exact results about this spectrum, exhibiting the allowed multiplets. Often, particles and solitons are in the same representation and therefore must have equal masses. Furthermore, the fusion category symmetry frequently implies the existence of certain stable states in the spectrum. The resulting degeneracies are encoded in quiver diagrams where nodes are vacua and arrows are excited states.</p>

            <h2>Sparse chaos in cortical circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rainer Engelken, Michael Monteforte, Fred Wolf</p>
            <p>Nerve impulses, the currency of information flow in the brain, are generated by an instability of the neuronal membrane potential dynamics. Neuronal circuits exhibit collective chaos that appears essential for learning, memory, sensory processing, and motor control. However, the factors controlling the nature and intensity of collective chaos in neuronal circuits are not well understood. Here we use computational ergodic theory to demonstrate that basic features of nerve impulse generation profoundly affect collective chaos in neuronal circuits. Numerically exact calculations of Lyapunov spectra, Kolmogorov-Sinai-entropy, and upper and lower bounds on attractor dimension show that changes in nerve impulse generation in individual neurons moderately impact information encoding rates but qualitatively transform phase space structure. Specifically, we find a drastic reduction in the number of unstable manifolds, Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, and attractor dimension. Beyond a critical point, marked by the simultaneous breakdown of the diffusion approximation, a peak in the largest Lyapunov exponent, and a localization transition of the leading covariant Lyapunov vector, networks exhibit sparse chaos: prolonged periods of near stable dynamics interrupted by short bursts of intense chaos. Analysis of large, more realistically structured networks supports the generality of these findings. In cortical circuits, biophysical properties appear tuned to this regime of sparse chaos. Our results reveal a close link between fundamental aspects of single-neuron biophysics and the collective dynamics of cortical circuits, suggesting that nerve impulse generation mechanisms are adapted to enhance circuit controllability and information flow.</p>

Despite extensive work, the essential physics of many of these systems is not understood and there is very little ability to make predictions in this class of materials. In this manuscript we share our personal views on the major open problems in the field of correlated electron systems. We discuss some possible routes to make progress in this rich and fascinating field. This manuscript is the result of the vigorous discussions and deliberations that took place at Johns Hopkins University during a three-day workshop January 27, 28, and 29, 2020 that brought together six senior scientists and 46 more junior scientists. Our hope, is that the topics we have presented will provide inspiration for others working in this field and motivation for the idea that significant progress can be made on very hard problems if we focus our collective energies.</p>

            <h2>Phase Thermalization: from Fermi Liquid to Incoherent Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pinaki Banerjee, Bidisha Chakrabarty, Swapnamay Mondal</p>
            <p>When a system consists of a large subsystem (bath) and a small one (probe), thermalization implies induction of temperature of the bath onto the probe. If both the bath and the probe are described by same microscopic Hamiltonian, thermalization further entails that the probe imbibes the phase of the bath. We refer to this phenomenon as {\it phase thermalization}. However, it is not clear whether this phenomenon is realizable when the probe and the bath are described by different microscopic Hamiltonians. We show {\it phase thermalization} is possible even when the microscopic Hamiltonians differ significantly. We provide an explicit example, where the probe is a Fermi liquid realized by a Majorana chain with $n \gg 1$ fermions per site interacting through random hopping and the bath is an incoherent metal described by another Majorana chain with $N > n$ fermions per site interacting through arbitrarily long range random four-fermion interaction. In deep infrared (\emph{i.e.} at very low energies), the probe turns into an incoherent metal, with Lyapunov spectrum and diffusion coefficient identical to the bath.</p>

            <h2>Kondo $s$-$d$ exchange in the CuO$_2$ plane as the long sought interaction determining $T_c$ in cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Todor M. Mishonov, Albert M. Varonov</p>
            <p>The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals why the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band is so important. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of d-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. We have a hint that possibly the long sought pairing mechanism has possibly been found and the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Polymer networks which locally rotate to accommodate stresses, torques, and deformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Grasinger</p>
            <p>Polymer network models construct the constitutive relationships of a broader polymer network from the behavior of a single polymer chain (e.g. viscoelastic response to applied forces, applied electromagnetic fields, etc.). Network models have been used for multiscale phenomena in a variety of contexts such as rubber elasticity, soft multifunctional materials, biological materials, and even the curing of polymers. For decades, a myriad of polymer network models have been developed with differing numbers of chains, arranged in different ways, and with differing symmetries. To complicate matters further, there are also competing assumptions for how macroscopic variables (e.g. deformation) are related to individual chains within the network model. In this work, we propose a simple, intuitive assumption for how the network locally rotates relative to applied loading (e.g. stresses, external fields) and show that this assumption unifies many of the disparate polymer network models--while also recovering one of the most successful models for rubber elasticity, the Arruda-Boyce $8$-chain model. The new assumption is then shown to make more intuitive predictions (than prior models) for stimuli-responsive networks with orientational energies (e.g. electroactive polymers), which is significant for shape morphing and designing high degree of freedom actuators (e.g. for soft robotics). Lastly, we unveil some surprising consequences of the new model for the phases of multistable biopolymer and semi-crystalline networks.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Wigner-Mott transition at $\nu=1/5$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas G. Kiely, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Electrons can organize themselves into charge-ordered states to minimize the effects of long-ranged Coulomb interactions. In the presence of a lattice, commensurability constraints lead to the emergence of incompressible Wigner-Mott insulators at various rational electron fillings, $\nu~=p/q$. The mechanism for quantum fluctuation-mediated melting of the Mott insulators with increasing electron kinetic energy remains an outstanding problem. Here, using matrix product state techniques, we analyze the bandwidth-tuned transition out of the Wigner-Mott insulator at $\nu=1/5$ in an extended Hubbard model on infinite cylinders of varying circumference. For the two-leg ladder, the transition from the Mott insulator to the Luttinger liquid proceeds via a distinct intermediate phase with gapless Cooper-pairs and gapped electronic excitations. The resulting Luther-Emery liquid is the analog of a strongly fluctuating superconductor. We place these results in the context of a low-energy bosonization based theory for the transition. On the five-leg cylinder, we provide numerical evidence for a direct continuous transition between the Wigner-Mott insulator and a metallic phase across which the spin and charge-gaps vanish simultaneously. We comment on the connections to ongoing experiments in dual-gated bilayer moiré transition metal dichalcogenide materials.</p>

            <h2>Collective epithelial migration mediated by the unbinding of hexatic defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Krommydas, Livio Nicola Carenza, Luca Giomi</p>
            <p>Collective cell migration in epithelia relies on cell intercalation: a local remodelling of the cellular network that allows neighbouring cells to swap their positions. Unlike foams and passive cellular fluid, in epithelial intercalation these rearrangements crucially depend on activity. During these processes, the local geometry of the network and the contractile forces generated therein conspire to produce a burst of remodelling events, which collectively give rise to a vortical flow at the mesoscopic length scale. In this article we formulate a continuum theory of the mechanism driving this process, built upon recent advances towards understanding the hexatic (i.e. $6-$fold ordered) structure of epithelial layers. Using a combination of active hydrodynamics and cell-resolved numerical simulations, we demonstrate that cell intercalation takes place via the unbinding of topological defects, naturally initiated by fluctuations and whose late-times dynamics is governed by the interplay between passive attractive forces and active self-propulsion. Our approach sheds light on the structure of the cellular forces driving collective migration in epithelia and provides an explanation of the observed extensile activity of in vitro epithelial layers.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity in single-layer graphene has attracted considerable interest. Here, using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we study transitions of superconductivity and magnetism in a monolayer graphene with a special periodic strain. Consistent with experiments, the deformation accumulates a series of flat bands, whose robustness under interaction is verified through electron localization in real space. During the reconstruction of the band structure, the superconductivity appears in flat band range with next-nearest neighbor $d+id$ pairing symmetry dominating other modes and is accompanied by ferromagnetism caused by symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate that the strain-induced symmetry breaking would accumulate an energy-gap antiferromagnetic insulating phase at half filling even under the limitation of not strong enough interaction, which shows its potential as a platform that exhibits strongly correlated phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Wen Yu, Bang-Gui Liu</p>
            <p>2D materials can host interesting physics and have important applications in various fields. Recent experiment shows that monolayer PtSe$_2$ nanoflakes with neutral zigzag edges are stable. Here, we study semiconducting stoichiometric PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons with the stable neutral zigzag edges (with $N$ describing different nanoribbon width) through combining detailed first-principles investigation with low-energy model analysis. Our careful analysis of first-principles conduction and valence bands (with the spin-orbits coupling taken into account) indicates that the low-energy bands assume relativistic energy dispersion in an energy window of [-0.2 eV, 0.2eV] (at least) and have large unconventional Rashba spin splitting (for even $N$). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the low-energy bands can be well described by an effective one-dimensional electron model and the semiconductor gap will remain finite even for large $N$. Most importantly, it is shown that there exists SU(2) spin symmetry in both of the conduction and valence bands for each edge, which implies persistent spin helices (in the spin xy plane) and spin-conserving carrier transport. When the inter-edge interaction becomes weak ($N$ is large enough), a nearly-perfect Dirac fermion system can be achieved through combining the valence and conduction bands. Thus we realize unconventional Rashba splitting, double SU(2) spin symmetry, persistent spin helices/textures, and pure Dirac fermion systems in stable monolayer PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons.</p>

            <p>Reducing the contact resistance of field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional materials is one of the key improvements required to enable the integration of such transistors in an advanced semiconductor manufacturing process. Suitably designed lateral heterojunctions provide an opportunity to independently tailor the contact and channel properties in order to optimize contact resistance. Inspired by the recent experimental demonstration of a two-dimensional $p$-type Schottky barrier, here we use quantum transport simulations to estimate the performance of $p$-type transistors in which the channel consists of a lateral heterostructure of NbS$_2$/MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ (semimetal-semiconductor-semimetal). We find that the gate alignment with the channel is a critical design parameter, strongly influencing the capability of the gate to modulate the Schottky barrier at the MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ interface. This effect is also found to significantly affect the scaling behavior of the device.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiguo Yin, A. M. Tsvelik</p>
            <p>The notion of "half fire, half ice" was recently introduced to describe an exotic macroscopic ground-state degeneracy emerging in a ferrimagnet under the critical magnetic field, in which the "hot" spins are fully disordered on the sublattice with smaller magnetic moments and the "cold" spins are fully ordered on the sublattice with larger magnetic moments. Here we further point out that this state has a twin named "half ice, half fire" in which the hot and cold spins switch positions. The new state is an excited state -- thus hidden in the ground-state phase diagram -- and is robust with respect to the interactions that destroy the half fire, half ice state. We demonstrate with exact results how this hidden state can drive phase switching at desirable finite temperature, even for the one-dimensional Ising model where phase transition at finite temperature is forbidden. We suggest that our findings may open a new door to the understanding and controlling of phase competition and transition in unconventional frustrated systems.</p>

            <p>The kinetics of dislocation reactions, such as dislocation multiplication, controls the plastic deformation in crystals beyond their elastic limit, therefore critical mechanisms in a number of applications in materials science. We present a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations that shows that one such type of reactions, the nucleation of dislocation at free surfaces, exhibit extremely unconventional kinetics, including unexpectedly large nucleation rates under compression, very strong entropic stabilization under tension, as well as strong non-Arrhenius behavior. These unusual kinetics are quantitatively rationalized using a variational transition state theory approach coupled with an efficient numerical scheme for the estimation of vibrational entropy changes. These results highlight the need for a variational treatment of the kinetics to quantitatively capture dislocation reaction kinetics, especially at low-to-moderate strains where large deformations are required to activate reactions. These observations suggest possible explanations to previously observed unconventional deformation kinetics in both molecular dynamics simulations and experiments.</p>

            <p>Totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) sets the paradigm for one-dimensional driven single file motion. We study a periodic TASEP with two ``road blocks'' or defects of different kinds, one point and another extended, across which particle flows are inhibited. We show how the interplay between particle number conservation and competition between the defects lead to inhomogeneous steady states with localised domain walls (LDW). The LDW locations jump discontinuously, indicating a discontinuous transition between these LDW states, as the system passes from being controlled by one defect to the other. When the defects are ``competing'', instead of an LDW a pair of delocalised domain walls appear, none of which can penetrate the extended defect. A minimum current principle can be used to identify the dominant defect that controls the domain wall formations. Our results should be important in diverse systems, ranging from protein synthesis by ribosomes in biological cells to urban traffic networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jérémie Klinger, Grant M. Rotskoff</p>
            <p>Physical systems driven away from equilibrium by an external controller dissipate heat to the environment; the excess entropy production in the thermal reservoir can be interpreted as a "cost" to transform the system in a finite time. The connection between measure theoretic optimal transport and dissipative nonequilibrium dynamics provides a language for quantifying this cost and has resulted in a collection of "thermodynamic speed limits", which argue that the minimum dissipation of a transformation between two probability distributions is directly proportional to the rate of driving. Thermodynamic speed limits rely on the assumption that the target probability distribution is perfectly realized, which is almost never the case in experiments or numerical simulations. Here, we address the ubiquitous situation in which the external controller is imperfect. As a consequence, we obtain a lower bound for the dissipated work in generic nonequilibrium control problems that 1) is asymptotically tight and 2) matches the thermodynamic speed limit in the case of optimal driving. We illustrate these bounds on analytically solvable examples and also develop a strategy for optimizing minimally dissipative protocols based on optimal transport flow matching, a generative machine learning technique. This latter approach ensures the scalability of both the theoretical and computational framework we put forth. Crucially, we demonstrate that we can compute the terms in our bound numerically using efficient algorithms from the computational optimal transport literature and that the protocols that we learn saturate the bound.</p>

            <p>We perform extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations of an ensemble of realistic microgel particles in swollen conditions in a wide range of packing fractions $\zeta$. We compare neutral and charged microgels, where we consider charges distribution adherent to experimental conditions. Through a detailed analysis of single-particle behavior, we are able to identify the different regimes occurring upon increasing concentration: from shrinking to deformation and interpenetration, always connecting our findings to available experimental observations. We then link these single-particle features to the collective behavior of the suspension, finding evidence of a structural reentrance, that has no counterpart in the dynamics. Hence, while the maximum of the radial distribution function displays a non-monotonic behavior with increasing $\zeta$, the dynamics, quantified by the microgels' mean-squared displacement, always slows down. This behavior, at odds with simple Hertzian model, can be described by a phenomenological multi-Hertzian, which takes into account the enhanced internal stiffness of the core. However, also this model fails when deformation enters into play, whereby more realistic many-body models are required. We are able to unveil the key physical mechanisms, shrinking and deformation, giving rise to the structural reentrance that holds up to very large packing fractions. We further identify key similarities and differences between neutral and charged microgels, for which we detect at high enough $\zeta$ the fusion of charged shells, previously invoked to explain key experimental findings, and responsible for the structural reentrance. Overall, our study establishes a powerful framework to uncover the physics of microgel suspensions, paving the way to tackle different regimes and internal structural architectures, where experimental evidence is still limited.</p>

In particular, the magnon spin current is dominated by electric field component which perpendicular to the magnetization direction. We apply our theory to 1D ferromagnetic SSH model and show that the generated magnon spin current is closely related to the band geometry.

            <p>Thermal transport in crystals is influenced by chemistry, boundaries, and nanostructure. The anharmonic phonon band structure extracted from molecular-dynamics simulations provides an illuminating view of both the type and extent of prevalence of wavelike mechanisms underlying the transport, yet falls short of elucidating the nature of thermal evolution for different phonon regimes. Here we present an analysis framework for the characterization of the entropic signature of the mechanisms induced by boundaries and nanostructure, using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium atomistic simulations. Specifically, we examine the effects of phonon confinement, Bragg scattering, and local resonances on the configurational phase space in room-temperature nanostructured silicon, and quantify how each modifies the rate of entropy production and thermal relaxation. We reveal that the presence of phonon local resonances spanning the full spectrum enables a highly ordered regime of heat conduction to be approached, where irreversible evolution and entropy maximization are severely hindered by extensive mode hybridizations caused by the resonances. This unique regime of transport paves the way for ultra-precise phonon control for a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p>Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.</p>

            <p>The discovery of a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and its novel mechanism holds significant promise for advancing both fundamental research and practical applications. Magnetic kagome lattice materials are uniquely suited for studying the AHE due to their interplay between electronic structure, topology, and magnetism. However, the geometric frustration inherent in kagome lattices often limits the configuration and tunability of magnetic order. Here, we present a new design strategy for kagome-lattice materials with emergent magnetism, exemplified by the magnetic kagome metal TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$, which features interwoven magnetic Tb zigzag chains and non-magnetic Ti kagome bilayers. This material exhibits a record-high anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 10$^5$ $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$. Spectroscopy measurements reveal a large band folding gap observed via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, coexisting spin-density-wave (SDW) order detected through spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and a spiral magnetic order with large magnetic moments identified by neutron diffraction. These findings highlight a strong electron-magnetic coupling between itinerant charges and ordered magnetic moments, offering a spectroscopic explanation for the giant AHC in TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$. This work establishes a pathway for innovative material design strategies, unlocking new possibilities for future exploration and applications in quantum and spintronic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Tailoring the Growth of $\beta$-Tungsten Using Substrate Bias and Its Effect on FMR-Driven Spin Pumping in $\beta$-W/Py Heterostructures</h2>

            <p>$\beta$-Tungsten ($\beta$-W), an A15 cubic phase of tungsten, exhibits a giant spin Hall angle compared to its bcc-phase $\alpha$-Tungsten ($\alpha$-W), making high-quality $\beta$-W films desirable for spintronic applications. We report the controlled growth of $\beta$-W films on SiO$_2$/Si substrates via DC sputtering, where substrate bias serves as a critical factor in stabilizing the $\beta$ phase by regulating the energy of deposited atoms. This approach enables the formation of $\beta$-W films over a wide thickness range. Additionally, we studied the spin pumping phenomena in different tungsten phases achieved through substrate bias. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements reveal an enhancement in the magnetic damping (\( \alpha_{\text{eff}} \)) for $\beta$-W/Py compared to $\alpha$-W/Py dominated film. The effective spin mixing conductance (\( g_{\text{eff}}^{\uparrow\downarrow} \)) is found to be higher in $\beta$-W/Py than in $\alpha$-W/Py, which is attributed to variations in the interface structures between these phases. Importantly, the use of substrate bias does not deteriorate the interface quality, underscoring its effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of substrate bias in thin-film engineering, paving the way for its advanced utilization in spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Supersolid Phase in the Diluted Holstein Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingyao Meng, Yuxi Zhang, Rafael M. Fernandes, Tianxing Ma, R. T. Scalettar</p>
            <p>The Holstein model on a square lattice at half-filling has a well-established finite temperature phase transition to an insulating state with long range charge density wave (CDW) order. Because this CDW formation suppresses pairing, a superconducting (SC) phase emerges only with doping. In this work, we study the effects of dilution of the local phonon degrees of freedom in the Holstein model while keeping the system at half filling. We find not only that the CDW remains present up to a dilution fraction $f \sim 0.15$, but also that long range pairing is stabilized with increasing $f$, resulting in a {\it supersolid} regime centered at $f \approx 0.10$, where long range diagonal and off-diagonal correlations coexist. Further dilution results in a purely SC phase, and ultimately in a normal metal. Our results provide a new route to the supersolid phase via the introduction of impurities at fixed positions which both increase quantum fluctuations and also are immune to the competing tendency to phase separation often observed in the doped case.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model: A comprehensive Monte Carlo study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Feng Song, Youjin Deng, Yuan-Yao He</p>
            <p>The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations can induce rich phenomena at finite temperatures in strongly correlated fermion systems. Here we report a {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) study for the finite-temperature properties of three-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model at half filling. We concentrate on the complete temperature-interaction strength phase diagram of the model, which contains the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range ordered phase and metal-insulator crossover (MIC) in the paramagnetic phase. Enabling access to unprecedented system sizes up to $20^3$, we achieve highly accurate results of the Néel transition temperature for representative values of on-site interaction $U$ via finite-size analysis of AFM structure factor. To quantitatively characterize the MIC above the Néel transition, we have developed fully new techniques allowing to compute the thermal entropy versus $U$ at fixed temperature and to directly calculate the $U$-derivative of double occupancy in AFQMC simulations. Then combining variously thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish an efficient scheme to precisely determine the boundaries for the MIC by cross-checking different observables. We also demonstrate the temperature dependence of many commonly used observables. Away from half filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and AFM spin correlation versus hole doping, and demonstrate the persistance of Néel AFM ordered phase to finite doping with limited results.</p>

            <p>In this work, it is shown that improvements can be introduced into the current models of the ideal Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas to take into account the quantum nature of phase space, which is related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. The Hamiltonian operator for a gas particle and its eigenstates are first determined, and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the grand canonical potential, the thermodynamic particle number, the internal energy, the Von Neumann entropy, and the pressure, as well as the thermodynamic state equations corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperatures and for confined volumes. They allow for the highlighting of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamic functions and variables are directly related to the quantum statistical variances of the momenta. Well-known relations corresponding to the classical ideal gas model can be recovered from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperatures and for large volumes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergey E. Skipetrov</p>
            <p>For a Hamiltonian ${\hat H}$ containing a position-dependent (disordered) potential, we introduce a sequence of landscape functions $u_n(\vec{r})$ obeying ${\hat H} u_n(\vec{r}) = u_{n-1}(\vec{r})$ with $u_0(\vec{r}) = 1$. For $n \to \infty$, $1/v_n(\vec{r}) = u_{n-1}(\vec{r})/u_{n}(\vec{r})$ converges to the lowest eigenenergy $E_1$ of ${\hat H}$ whereas $u_{\infty}(\vec{r})$ yields the corresponding wave function $\psi_1(\vec{r})$. For large but finite $n$, $v_n(\vec{r})$ can be approximated by a piecewise constant function $v_n(\vec{r}) \simeq v_n^{(m)}$ for $\vec{r} \in \Omega_m$ and yields progressively improving estimations of eigenenergies $E_m = 1/v_n^{(m)}$ of locally fundamental eigenstates $\psi_m(\vec{r}) \propto u_{n}(\vec{r})$ in spatial domains $\Omega_m$. These general results are illustrated by a number of examples in one dimension: box potential, sequence of randomly placed infinite potential barriers, smooth and spatially uncorrelated random potentials, quasiperiodic potential, as well as for the uncorrelated random potential in two dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of relativistic field-derivative torque in nonlinear THz response of magnetization dynamics</h2>

            <p>Understanding the complete light-spin interactions in magnetic systems is the key to manipulating the magnetization using optical means at ultrafast timescales. The selective addressing of spins by terahertz (THz) electromagnetic fields via Zeeman torque is one of the most successful ultrafast means of controlling magnetic excitations. Here we show that this traditional Zeeman torque on the spins is not sufficient, rather an additional relativistic field-derivative torque is essential to realize the observed magnetization dynamics. We accomplish this by exploring the ultrafast nonlinear magnetization dynamics of rare-earth, Bi-doped iron garnet when excited by two co-propagating THz pulses. First, by exciting the sample with an intense THz pulse and probing the magnetization dynamics using magneto-optical Faraday effect, we find the collective exchange resonance mode between rare-earth and transition metal sublattices at 0.48 THz. We further explore the magnetization dynamics via the THz time-domain spectroscopic means. We find that the observed nonlinear trace of the magnetic response cannot be mapped to the magnetization precession induced by the Zeeman torque, while the Zeeman torque supplemented by an additional field-derivative torque follows the experimental evidences. This breakthrough enhances our comprehension of ultra-relativistic effects and paves the way towards novel technologies harnessing light-induced control over magnetic systems.</p>

            <p>Size-invariant shape transformation is a geometric technique that allows for a clear separation between quantum size and shape effects by modifying the shape of the confinement domain without altering its size. The impact of shape on the behavior of confined systems is significantly different from that of size, making it an emerging area of research. The recent realization of flat-bottomed optical box traps has further contributed to the study of quantum gases in complex confinement geometries. Here, we propose shape-induced Bose-Einstein condensation at a fixed size, temperature, and density. We investigate the impact of pure quantum shape effects on a non-interacting Bose gas confined within nested square domains, where the shape parameter is defined and controlled by the rotation angle between the inner and outer squares. Our findings reveal that specific heat exhibits an additional low-temperature peak at certain shapes. This work opens new avenues for controlling quantum systems through geometric manipulation and provides insights into the thermodynamic properties of Bose gases under shape-induced quantum effects.</p>

In particular, in Josephson junctions with three and four superconductors, we find stable lines and surfaces of exceptional points protected by non-Hermitian topology and highly tuneable by the superconducting phases. We also discover that, in Josephson junctions formed by laterally coupled superconductors, exceptional points can result from hybridized Andreev bound states and lead to the enhancement of supercurrents controlled by dissipation.

            <p>Strain modulation is a crucial way in engineering nanoscale materials. It is even more important for single photon emitters in layered materials, where strain can create quantum emitters and control their energies. Here we report the localized, charge-enhanced coupling between the charged localized emitters in monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) to the piezoelectric relaxor ferroelectric substrate. In addition to the strain effect, we observe a gigantic polarizability volume with the enhancement factor up to 1010. The enormous polarizability leads to a large Quantum-confined Stark shift under a small variation of electric field, indicating the potential of integrating layered materials with functional substrates for quantum sensing. We further demonstrate the tunable diamagnetic shift and g-factor with strain varying by ~0.05%, which confirms the existence of enhanced interaction between the localized oscillating dipoles and the ferroelectric domains. Our results signify the prospect of charged quantum emitters in layered materials for quantum sciences and technology.</p>

            <p>We study the diode effect of the supercurrent in the Josephson junctions with the loop current states as the tunneling barrier. The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning-Jing Yang, Zhigao Huang, Jian-Min Zhang</p>
            <p>Inspired by recent experimental observations of hybrid topological states [Hossain et al. Nature 628, 527 (2024)], we predict hybrid-order topological insulators in 1H transition metal compounds (TMCs), where both second-order and first-order topological (FOT) states coexist near the Fermi level. Initially, 1H-TMCs exhibit a second-order topological phase due to the d orbital bandgap. Upon coupling of p and d orbitals through the crystal field effect, first-order topological characteristics emerge. This hybrid-order topological phase transition can be tuned via crystal field effects. Combined with first-principles calculations, we illustrate the phase transition with WTe2 and NbSe2. The WTe2 exhibits hybrid-order under ambient conditions, while NbSe2 transitions to hybrid-order under pressure. Additionally, the first-order topological bandgap in the HyOTI demonstrates a strong spin Hall effect. Our findings reveal a hybrid-order topological phase in two-dimensional electron materials and underscore spintronic applications.</p>

Using a combination of analytical techniques based on exact methods and asymptotic hydrodynamic approaches, we discuss the behavior of the gas as its initial temperature varies, and back up our derivations with numerical exact diagonalization of the model. Our findings reveal that, irrespective of the initial temperature, the non-equilibrium behavior of density-density correlations at sufficiently large times is characterized by algebraic decay. Furthermore, we provide analytical results based on quantum generalized hydrodynamics that match with the numerical data both at zero and finite temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. Zeng</p>
            <p>We predict the coexistence of tunneling spin and valley Hall effects when electrons in graphene coherently transmit through a barrier with the broken inversion symmetry and proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. Due to the rotation of the pseudospin in the tunneling process, the transmitted electrons acquire a finite spin- and valley-dependent backreflection geometric phase when the two interfaces of the barrier are asymmetric. This results in a spin- and valley-dependent skew coherent tunneling, which is responsible for the transverse spin and valley Hall currents. We further demonstrate that the coherent-tunneling assisted charge-spin and charge-valley conversions are highly efficient with large Hall angles. Our work provides a new route for the generation of efficient spin and valley Hall effects, suggesting potential applications for spintronic and valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.</p>

            <p>Collaborative filtering generates recommendations based on user-item similarities through rating data, which may involve numerous unrated items. To predict scores for unrated items, matrix factorization techniques, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), are often employed to predict scores for unrated items. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF), which is an extension of NMF, approximates a nonnegative matrix as the product of nonnegative and binary matrices. Previous studies have employed NBMF for image analysis where the data were dense. In this paper, we propose a modified NBMF algorithm that can be applied to collaborative filtering where data are sparse. In the modified method, unrated elements in a rating matrix are masked, which improves the collaborative filtering performance. Utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of the computation time, making the proposed method beneficial.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Kundu, Siddhartha Lal</p>
            <p>In the field of DNA nanotechnology, it is common wisdom that charge transport occurs through the {\pi} stacked bases of double-stranded DNA. However, recent experimental findings by Zhuravel et. al. [Nat. Nanotech. 15, 836 (2020)] suggest that electronic transport happens through the backbone channels instead of {\pi}-{\pi} interaction of the nitrogen bases. These new experimental insights call for a detail investigation. In keeping with this, we examine charge transport properties of three characteristic double-stranded DNA sequences (periodic GC, periodic AT and random ATGC sequences) within a tight-binding framework where backbones form the main conduction channels. Using techniques based on the Green function method, we inspect the single-particle density of states and localization properties of DNA in the presence of discontinuities (nicks) along the backbone channels. We also investigate the effect of these nicks on current-voltage response using the Landauer - Buttiker formalism for a two-terminal geometry where the source electrode is attached to one backbone strand and the drain to the other. We observe that the periodic DNA sequence of GC bases is metallic in nature, while the periodic AT sequence and the random ATGC sequence are insulating. Further, the effects of nicks on the transport properties of the periodic GC sequence is interesting: while a single nick on the upper backbone does not affect electronic transport, the addition of a second nick on the lower backbone causes the current to vanish altogether. This is found to be robust against changes in the positions of the nicks, as well as the alternation of the source and drain electrodes.</p>

            <p>Spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are of particular interest for functional oxide electronics applications. The redox-created 2DEG residing on the strontium titanate, SrTiO$_3$ (STO), side of a europium monoxide (EuO)/SrTiO$_3$ (001) interface is expected to be significantly spin-polarized due to the proximity to the strong ($7\,\mu_B/f.u.$) Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO. We apply magnetic circular dichroism in the angular distribution (MCDAD) of photoemitted electrons to investigate whether and how the induced spin polarization of the 2DEG depends on the dimensionality of the overlaying EuO layer. The experimental data are complemented by density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term (DFT+$U$). We show that the EuO/STO interfacial 2DEG is spin-polarized even for ultrathin EuO overlayers, starting at an EuO threshold thickness of only two monolayers. Additional EuO monolayers even increase the induced magnetic Ti moment and thus the spin polarization of the 2DEG. Our results and the potential to enhance the magnetic order of EuO by other proximity effects indicate that the EuO/STO (001) interface is an ideal template for creating (multi-)functional spin-polarized 2DEGs for application in oxide electronics.</p>

Using a semianalytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As a demonstration of their capabilities, we show that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.</p>

            <p>We consider a run-and-tumble particle moving on a half-line with a periodic force field and an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two fixed values at Poisson-distributed times. The particle evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics. The periodic force field is assumed to be such that every point in a given period interval is accessible to the particle. The survival probability of the particle satisfies a backward Fokker--Planck equation. The Laplace transform of this equation yields systems of equations satisfied by the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first passage time has already been calculated assuming that the particle reaches the origin in finite time almost surely. We calculate the exit probability of the particle, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the exit probability is less than one. If the force field is a constant drift, the condition is satisfied by positive values of the drift. The mean first-passage time of the particle (averaged over trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed form in both regimes.</p>

            <p>We analyze the aggregation of locally amphiphilic copolymers with blocky architecture and uniformly distributed amphiphilic moieties in terms of a mean-field theory. Locally amphiphilic structure is characteristic of many thermoresponsive polymers, both linear and grafted, which endows them with local surface activity. Self-assembly of such copolymers exhibits a rich diversity of morphologies, which are analyzed in the present work in the limit of high surface activity of amphiphilic dimers with solvophilic/polar pendants. Depending on the composition and architecture of the copolymer and sizes and interaction parameters of the solvophilic/polar pendants, we build morphological diagrams of copolymer solutions. Copolymers with small volume pendants form precipitates or large aggregates with internal voids containing these pendants. For moderate volume pendants, a lamellar structure (or large vesicles) is observed at smaller fractions of amphiphilic monomer units in the chain and micelles are formed at larger fractions of these units. The sizes and shapes of micelles depend on the monomer distribution along the chain, and the blocky architecture favors the existence of single spherical micelles or spherical particles that constitute compound micelles. For sufficiently large polar pendants, copolymers of both types mainly form granular branched compound micelles. The distance at which adjacent hydrophobic and polar groups are located in a chain determines the size of domains and particles formed by locally amphiphilic blocks or chains. Our predictions explain the existence of dense multicore complex micelles consisting of beads of several tens of nanometers size and other structures such as disc-shaped micelles.</p>

            <p>Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</p>

            <h2>Moving Protocol of Majorana Corner Modes in a Superconducting 2D Weyl Semimetal Heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ching-Kai Chiu, Yueh-Ting Yao, Tay-Rong Chang, Guang Bian</p>
            <p>Second-order topological superconductors host Majorana corner modes (MCMs), which are confined to specific corners of the system. This spatial restriction presents challenges for manipulating and relocating MCMs. We propose a novel protocol for dynamically controlling the movement of time-reversal symmetric MCMs in a heterostructure consisting of a 2D Weyl semimetal and a $d$-wave superconductor. By leveraging the energy asymmetry of topological edge states in the 2D Weyl semimetal, the position of MCMs can be effectively tuned via chemical potential adjustments. We further introduce a device architecture that integrates multiple heterostructure blocks, each controlled by independent gate voltages, to enable the adiabatic movement and exchange of MCMs. This approach demonstrates a robust mechanism for Majorana manipulation and provides a scalable framework for future experimental studies of topological quantum computation.</p>

A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</p>

            <p>We investigate the topological properties of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$, focusing on spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity, Chern numbers, Berry curvature, and Nernst coefficient. Spin-valley-dependent electronic states with distinct spin textures offer potential applications in spintronic devices. Our calculations reveal helical and chiral spin texture for spin-up, and spin-down respectively, by opposing electron and hole orientation in the conduction and valence bands. The Berry curvature behavior in the vicinity of the Dirac points for different values of $\alpha$, reveals a sign change and topological phase transitions in 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$. When $\alpha<1$, the system exhibits the Quantum Spin Hall Insulator (QSHI) phase ($C_s=1$), characterized by a non-trivial gap and helical edge mode. $\alpha>1$ is responsible for a topological phase transition to the band insulator (BI) ($C_v=1$) and killing the edge modes. Also when $\alpha=1$ the Fermi energy falls within the bands, consequently, the Chern number is not defined. Calculations of spin Nernst (SNC), valley Nernst (VNC), and total Nernst coefficients (TNC) further confirm the QSHI-to-BI phase transition under varying $\alpha$ and doping. These results provide comprehensive insights into the tunable topological properties of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ and their implications for spintronic and valleytronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Lunts, Aavishkar Patel, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower. Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., Phys. Rev. B 103, 155102 (2021), arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., Phys. Rev. X 12, 011037 (2022), arXiv:2106.05959). We argue that these observations support a non-symmetry-breaking Fermi-volume-changing transition as the underlying description of the onset of the pseudogap in the cuprates.</p>

            <p>Recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a Néel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting can emerge in the AB-stacking configurations. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP2S6, MnPX3 can show switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on its band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.</p>

            <p>The exact recursion relations are used to study the mixed half-integer spin-(3/2, 7/2) Blume-Capel Ising ferrimagnetic system on the Bethe lattice. Ground-state phase diagrams are computed in the $({D_{A}}/{q|J|}, {D_{B}}/{q|J|})$ plane to reveal different possible ground states of the model. Using the thermal changes of the order-parameters, interesting temperature dependent phase diagrams are constructed in the ($D_{A}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$), ($D_{B}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) planes as well as in the ($D/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) plane where $D=D_A=D_B$. It is revealed that the system exhibits first- and second-order phase transitions and compensation temperatures for specific model parameter values. Under the constraint of an external magnetic field, the model also produces multi-hysteresis behaviors as single, double and triple hysteresis cycles. Particularly, the impacts of the ferrimagnetic coupling $J$ on the remanent magnetization and the coercitive fields for selected values of the other physical parameters of the system are pointed out. Our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with those reported in the literature.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we studied the structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer in its pure and doped forms, using the density functional theory (DFT), and the calculations were performed using Quantum Espresso (QE) software package. The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</p>

            <p>Building on the multiband nature of iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), we have uncovered pronounced anisotropy in Majorana vortex topology arising from the interaction between vortex orientation and multiple electronic topologies. This anisotropy manifests in two distinct vortex configurations: the z-vortex and x-vortex, oriented perpendicular and parallel to the Dirac axis (z-axis for FeSCs), respectively. The x-vortex exhibits a unique duality, displaying two distinct topological phase diagrams. One is strikingly simple, comprising only trivial and topological superconducting phases, and remains resilient to multiband entanglement. The other mirrors the z-vortex's complex diagram, featuring alternating trivial, topological crystalline and topological superconducting phases. Crucially, the former is exclusive to the x-vortex and supports unpaired Majorana vortices across a wide parameter range, even with Dirac nodes in electronic bands. Notably, uniaxial strain can modulate these x-vortex phases, enabling the x-vortex to support both stable Majorana vortices and rich exotic physics in a controllable manner. Moreover, we propose that the x-vortex offers promising advantages for developing iron-based superconducting quantum devices. Our findings introduce a novel paradigm in vortex topology within multiband superconducting systems, highlighting the x-vortex as a promising platform for exploring Majorana physics and advancing iron-based superconducting quantum technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdelrahman Hussein, Byungki Kim, Kim Verbeken, Tom Depover</p>
            <p>Understanding hydrogen-grain boundary (GB) interactions is critical to the analysis of hydrogen embrittlement in metals. This work presents a mesoscale fully kinetic model to investigate the effect of GB misorientation on hydrogen diffusion and trapping using phase-field based representative volume elements (RVEs). The flux equation consists of three terms: a diffusive term and two terms for high and low angle grain boundary (H/LAGB) trapping. Uptake simulations showed that decreasing the grain size resulted in higher hydrogen content due to increasing the GB density. Permeation simulations showed that GBs are high flux paths due to their higher enrichment with hydrogen. Since HAGBs have higher enrichment than LAGBs, due to their higher trap-binding energy, they generally have the highest hydrogen flux. Nevertheless, the flux shows a convoluted behavior as it depends on the local concentration, alignment of GB with external concentration gradient as well as the GB network connectivity. Finally, decreasing the grain size resulted in a larger break-through time and a larger steady-state exit flux.</p>

Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design could potentially advance quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-qubits.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Split Vacancies with Foundation Models and Electrostatics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seán R. Kavanagh</p>
            <p>Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A particularly striking example of this is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic lowering of the defect energy and change in behaviour. Such species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for efficiently identifying such species in solid-state compounds, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of machine-learning potentials for defect investigations, with important caveats, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for correctly identifying stable defect geometries.</p>

We study the 2D MCI response to time reversal symmetric flux insertion, observing a $4\pi$ Aharonov-Bohm effect, relating these topological states to fractional quantum Hall states via the effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. As part of this response, we observe evidence of quantisation of a proposed topological invariant for compactified many-body states, to a rational number, suggesting higher-dimensional topology may also be relevant. Finally, we study effects of bulk perturbations breaking the symmetry-protected tensor product structure of the child Hamiltonian, finding the MCI evolves adiabatically into a topological skyrmion phase.</p>

            <p>Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>We present a non-perturbative framework for incorporating gauge field fluctuations into effective actions of QED3 in the infrared using fermionic particle-vortex duality. This approach is demonstrated through the applications to models containing N species of 2-component Dirac fermions in solvable and interpretable electromagnetic backgrounds, focusing on N = 1 or 2. For the N = 1 model, we establish a correspondence between fermion Casimir energy at finite density and the magnetic Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, and further evaluate the corrections to their amplitudes. This predicts amplification of charge susceptibility and reduction of magnetic permeability. We additionally provide physical interpretations for each component of our calculation and offer alternative derivations based on energy density measurements in different characteristic lengths. For N = 2, we show that magnetic catalysis is erased in a U(1)xU(1) QED3, indicating no breakdown of chiral symmetry. Reasoning is offered based on the properties of the lowest Landau level wave functions.</p>

We illustrate the generality of our findings by studying a wide range of different systems, e.g., bosons, fermions, spins, and mixtures thereof. We provide evidence that our analytical results describe the entanglement entropy of highly excited eigenstates of quantum-chaotic spin and boson systems, which is distinct from that of integrable counterparts.</p>

            <p>This work investigates adversarial training in the context of margin-based linear classifiers in the high-dimensional regime where the dimension $d$ and the number of data points $n$ diverge with a fixed ratio $\alpha = n / d$. We introduce a tractable mathematical model where the interplay between the data and adversarial attacker geometries can be studied, while capturing the core phenomenology observed in the adversarial robustness literature. Our main theoretical contribution is an exact asymptotic description of the sufficient statistics for the adversarial empirical risk minimiser, under generic convex and non-increasing losses for a Block Feature Model. Our result allow us to precisely characterise which directions in the data are associated with a higher generalisation/robustness trade-off, as defined by a robustness and a usefulness metric. We show that the the presence of multiple different feature types is crucial to the high sample complexity performances of adversarial training. In particular, we unveil the existence of directions which can be defended without penalising accuracy. Finally, we show the advantage of defending non-robust features during training, identifying a uniform protection as an inherently effective defence mechanism.</p>

            <p>We will explore the dynamical property of non-equilibrium phenomena induced by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theory (2d holographic CFT) Hamiltonian on the curved spacetime by studying the time dependence of the entanglement entropy and mutual information. Here, holographic CFT is the CFT having the gravity dual. We will start from the boundary and thermofield double states, evolve the systems in Euclidean time with the Hamiltonian on the curved background, and then evolve them in real-time with the same Hamiltonian. We found that the early- and late-time entanglement structure depends on the curved background, while the entanglement growth does not, and is linear. Furthermore, in the gravity dual for the thermofield double state, this entanglement growth is due to the linear growth of the wormhole, while in the one for the boundary state, it is due to the in-falling of the end of the world brane to the black hole. We discussed the low temperature system can be regarded as the dynamical system induced by the multi-joining quenches. We also discussed the effective description of the high temperature system, called line tension picture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime {to a quantum operator, playing the role of an renormalizable effective density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-Kähler formalism, as the direct sum of a zero-form, a one-form and a two-form. While the geometry of spacetime is defined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the matter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing the {\em G-field}, which acts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The obtained equations of modified gravity remain second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might clarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.</p>

            <h2>Rapidly yawing spheroids in viscous shear flow: Emergent loss of symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohit P. Dalwadi</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergent three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. We also demonstrate that this effective asymmetry generated by the rapid yawing can cause chaotic behaviour in the emergent dynamics, in stark contrast to the emergent dynamics generated by rapidly rotating spheroids, which are equivalent to those of effective passive spheroids. In general, we find that the shape of the equivalent effective particle under rapid yawing is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. In these scenarios, we calculate analytically the equivalent aspect ratio of the effective spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>Chaos and spatial prethermalization in driven-dissipative bosonic chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Ferrari, Fabrizio Minganti, Camille Aron, Vincenzo Savona</p>
            <p>Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain where the photon density remains high, and the chaotic dynamics give rise to a hydrodynamic regime, characterized by local equilibria with a large and slowly-varying effective chemical potential. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</p>

            <p>Dissipative tunneling remains a cornerstone effect in quantum mechanics. In chemistry, it plays a crucial role in governing the rates of chemical reactions, often modeled as the motion along the reaction coordinate from one potential well to another. The relative positions of energy levels in these wells strongly influence the reaction dynamics. Chemical research will benefit from a fully adjustable, asymmetric double-well equipped with precise measurement capabilities of the tunneling rates. In this paper, we show a quantum simulator system that consists of a continuously driven Kerr parametric oscillator with a third order non-linearity that can be operated in the quantum regime to create a fully tunable asymmetric double-well. Our experiment leverages a low-noise, all-microwave control system with a high-efficiency readout, based on a tunnel Josephson junction circuit, of the which-well information. We explore the reaction rates across the landscape of tunneling resonances in parameter space. We uncover two new and counter-intuitive effects: (i) a weak asymmetry can significantly decrease the activation rates, even though the well in which the system is initialized is made shallower, and (ii) the width of the tunneling resonances alternates between narrow and broad lines as a function of the well depth and asymmetry. We predict by numerical simulations that both effects will also manifest themselves in ordinary chemical double-well systems in the quantum regime. Our work is a first step for the development of analog molecule simulators of proton transfer reactions based on quantum superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>We explore the energy content of superpositions of current states. Specifically, we focus on the maximum energy that can be extracted from them through local unitary transformations. The figure of merit we employ is the local ergotropy. We perform a complete analysis in the whole range of the system's parameters. This way, we prove that superpositions of two current states in spatially closed spin networks are characterized by specific peaks in extractable energy, generally overcoming the ergotropy of each of the two separate current states characterized by a single winding number. The many-body state dynamics entails to ergotropy evolving in a controlled fashion. The implementation we suggest is based on a Rydberg-atom platform. Optimal transformations able to extract locally the maximum possible amount of energy are sorted out.</p>

            <h2>A Self-Supervised Robotic System for Autonomous Contact-Based Spatial Mapping of Semiconductor Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander E. Siemenn, Basita Das, Kangyu Ji, Fang Sheng, Tonio Buonassisi</p>
            <p>Integrating robotically driven contact-based material characterization techniques into self-driving laboratories can enhance measurement quality, reliability, and throughput. While deep learning models support robust autonomy, current methods lack reliable pixel-precision positioning and require extensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach for building self-supervised autonomy into contact-based robotic systems that teach the robot to follow domain expert measurement principles at high-throughputs. Firstly, we design a vision-based, self-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses differentiable image priors to optimize domain-specific objectives, refining the pixel precision of predicted robot contact poses by 20.0% relative to existing approaches. Secondly, we design a reliable graph-based planner for generating distance-minimizing paths to accelerate the robot measurement throughput and decrease planning variance by 6x. We demonstrate the performance of this approach by autonomously driving a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic probe for 24 hours to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity at 3,025 uniquely predicted poses across a gradient of drop-casted perovskite film compositions, achieving throughputs over 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals compositional trends and regions of inhomogeneity, valuable for identifying manufacturing process defects. With this self-supervised CNN-driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing the measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.</p>

            <p>Cement production, exceeding 4.1 billion tonnes and contributing 2.4 tonnes of CO2 annually, faces critical challenges in quality control and process optimization. While traditional process models for cement manufacturing are confined to steady-state conditions with limited predictive capability for mineralogical phases, modern plants operate under dynamic conditions that demand real-time quality assessment. Here, exploiting a comprehensive two-year operational dataset from an industrial cement plant, we present a machine learning framework that accurately predicts clinker mineralogy from process data. Our model achieves unprecedented prediction accuracy for major clinker phases while requiring minimal input parameters, demonstrating robust performance under varying operating conditions. Through post-hoc explainable algorithms, we interpret the hierarchical relationships between clinker oxides and phase formation, providing insights into the functioning of an otherwise black-box model. This digital twin framework can potentially enable real-time optimization of cement production, thereby providing a route toward reducing material waste and ensuring quality while reducing the associated emissions under real plant conditions. Our approach represents a significant advancement in industrial process control, offering a scalable solution for sustainable cement manufacturing.</p>

            <h2>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calderón, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</p>

            <h2>Aharonov-Bohm Interference in Even-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall States</h2>

            <p>Position exchange of non-Abelian anyons affects the quantum state of their system in a topologically-protected way. Their expected manifestations in even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems offer the opportunity to directly study their unique statistical properties in interference experiments. In this work, we present the observation of coherent Aharonov-Bohm interference at two even-denominator states in high-mobility bilayer graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures by employing the Fabry-Pérot interferometry (FPI) technique. Operating the interferometer at a constant filling factor, we observe an oscillation period corresponding to two flux quanta inside the interference loop, $\Delta\Phi=2\Phi_0$, at which the interference does not carry signatures of non-Abelian statistics. The absence of the expected periodicity of $\Delta\Phi=4\Phi_0$ may indicate that the interfering quasiparticles carry the charge $e^* = \frac{1}{2}e$ or that interference of $e^* = \frac{1}{4}e$ quasiparticles is thermally smeared. Interestingly, at two hole-conjugate states, we also observe oscillation periods of half the expected value, indicating interference of $e^* = \frac{2}{3}e$ quasiparticles instead of $e^* = \frac{1}{3}e$. To probe statistical phase contributions, we operated the FPI with controlled deviations of the filling factor, thereby introducing fractional quasiparticles inside the interference loop. The resulting changes to the interference patterns at both half-filled states indicate that the additional bulk quasiparticles carry the fundamental charge $e^*=\frac{1}{4}e$, as expected for non-Abelian anyons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Dong, Leonid Levitov, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>Systems in which exchange interactions couple carrier spins to a spin texture with a net chirality exhibit a spin-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, where the geometric gauge field and pseudo-magnetic field have opposite signs for carriers with opposite spins. As a result, Cooper pairs see a net zero vector potential and superconducting pairing is not hindered by pair-breaking effects. This allows superconductivity to occur even when the geometric field induces quantized Landau levels. We identify the dominant pairing order as an s-wave pair density wave of an FFLO type. Flat Landau levels can significantly enhance superconducting $T_c$, favoring superconductivity over competing orders. This exotic paired state features tell-tale signatures such as flat bands of Bogoliubov-deGennes quasiparticles, manifest through Landau level-like resonances in the quasiparticle density of states.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting Diode Effect in Double Quantum Dot Device</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Go Takeuchi, Mikio Eto</p>
            <p>Superconducting diode effect (SDE) is theoretically examined in double quantum dot coupled to three superconducting leads, $L$, $R1$ and $R2$. Lead $L$ is commonly connected to two quantum dots (QD1, QD2) while lead $R1$ ($R2$) is connected to QD1 (QD2) only. The phase differences $\varphi_{1}$ between leads $L$ and $R1$ and $\varphi_{2}$ between leads $L$ and $R2$ are tuned independently. The critical current into lead $R1$ depends on its direction unless $\varphi_{2} = 0$, $\pi$, which is ascribable to the formation of Andreev molecule between the QDs. In the absence of electron-electron interaction $U$ in the QDs, the spectrum of the Andreev bound states forms Dirac cones in the $\varphi_{1}-\varphi_{2}$ plane if the energy levels in the QDs are tuned to the Fermi level in the leads. The SDE is enhanced to almost 30\% when $\varphi_{2}$ is set to the value at the Dirac points. In the presence of $U$, the SDE is still observed when $U$ is smaller than the superconducting energy gap in the leads. Our device should be one of the minimal models for the SDE since a similar device with a single QD does not show the SDE.</p>

            <h2>Phase-Space Approach to Wannier Pairing and Bogoliubov Orbitals in Square-Octagon Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajesh O. Sharma, Tanmoy Das</p>
            <p>Low-energy lattice models are the cornerstone for understanding many-body effects and interactions between systems and measurements. A key challenge is identifying appropriate states that canonically transform between momentum and real space while retaining the correlation, entanglement, and geometric properties - generally called the Wannier obstruction. Here, we introduce a phase-space approach to bypass these obstructions. Instead of treating phase space as a manifold, we embed real space through a Bloch vector space at each momentum. Orbital and spin states are introduced through product states with the Bloch vector, while quantum statistics, correlations, topology, and entanglements are inherited from the Hamiltonian. We apply this framework to explore unconventional pairing symmetry and the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) equation in the phase space. Our findings demonstrate that while superconductivity exhibits global coherence in momentum space, the local Wannier orbital symmetry primarily determines the pairing symmetry. We analytically solve the spin-fluctuation mediated pairing symmetry on the phase space by engineering a flat band with artificial gauge fields. We then apply the model to a square-octagon superconductor Lu$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT) to unravel a coexistence of nodeless $s_{\pm}$ and nodal $s_{z^2}$ pairing symmetries. This phase-space framework provides a robust, obstruction-free lattice model for complex many-body systems and their exotic excitations.</p>

            <h2>An Addressable and Tunable Module for Donor-based Scalable Silicon Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shihang Zhang, Yu He, Peihao Huang</p>
            <p>Donor-based spin qubit offers a promising silicon quantum computing route for building large-scale qubit arrays, attributed to its long coherence time and advancements in nanoscale donor placement. However, the state-of-the-art device designs face scalability challenges, notably in achieving tunable two-qubit coupling and ensuring qubit addressability. Here, we propose a surface-code-compatible architecture, where each module has both tunable two-qubit gates and addressable single-qubit gates by introducing only a single extra donor in a pair of donors. We found that to compromise between the requirement of tunability and that of addressability, an asymmetric scheme is necessary. In this scheme, the introduced extra donor is strongly tunnel-coupled to one of the donor spin qubits for addressable single-qubit operation, while being more weakly coupled to the other to ensure the turning on and off of the two-qubit operation. The fidelity of single-qubit and two-qubit gates can exceed the fault-tolerant threshold in our design. Additionally, the asymmetric scheme effectively mitigates valley oscillations, allowing for engineering precision tolerances up to a few nanometers. Thus, our proposed scheme presents a promising prototype for large-scale, fault-tolerant, donor-based spin quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Spintronic Terahertz emitters, based on optically triggered spin-to-charge interconversion processes, have recently emerged as novel route towards compact and efficient THz sources. Yet, the next challenge for further technologically-relevant devices remains to modulate the emission, with low-energy consumption operation. To this aim, ferroelectric materials coupled to active spin-orbit layers such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are suitable candidates. In this work, we present the realization of a large area heterostructure of CoFeB/PtSe2/MoSe2 on a bi-domain LiNbO3 substrate. Using THz time-domain spectroscopy, we show that the ferroelectric polarization direction induces a sizeable modulation of the THz emission. We rationalise these experimental results by using band structure and spin accumulation calculations that are consistent with an interfacial spin-to-charge conversion mediated by inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect at the MoSe2/PtSe2 interface and being tuned by ferroelectricity in the adjacent LiNbO3 surface. This work points out the relevance of field effect spin-orbit architectures for novel THz technologies.</p>

            <p>We theoretically demonstrate that Chern number tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and second-order topological insulators can be induced in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator (TI), i.e., Kane-Mele model, by applying $d$-wave altermagnetism. When the Néel vector of altermagentism lies in the $x-y$ plane, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ TI is broken and driven into a second-order topological insulator phase, exhibiting the representative corner states at nanoflakes. When the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is further included, the second-order TI is further driven into the QAHE phase with various Chern numbers (e.g., $\mathcal{C}=\pm1$ or $\pm3$). When the Néel vector is along $z$ direction, the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is necessary to break the mirror symmetry to allow a sequential emergence of second-order TI and QAHE along with the increase of altermagentism strength. We also observe the QAHE with mixed-chirality, i.e., there exist counter-propagating edge modes but net chiral current at the ribbon boundary. Our work shows that altermagnetism can play a crucial role in exploring a rich variety of topological phases, just like its counterparts of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Li, Yulei Han, Zhenhua Qiao</p>
            <p>Recently, the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) has been theoretically proposed in compensated antiferromagnetic systems by using the magnetic topological insulator model [see arXiv:2404.13305 (2024)]. However, the related and systematic study based on a realistic material system is still limited. As the only experimentally realized antiferromagnetic topological insulator, MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ becomes a vital platform for exploring various topological states. In this work, by using the comprehensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the QAHE can also be realized in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ without combined parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. Using a magnetic topological insulator model, the layer-resolved Chern number is calculated to further understand the physical origin of different Chern numbers. The application of external hydrostatic pressure can strengthen the Te-Te quasicovalent bond due to the dramatic compression of the van der Waals gap. Thus, the resulting topological nontrivial gap can exceed the room-temperature energy scale in a wide range of pressures. Additionally, we find that constructing MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$/CrI$_{3}$ heterostructure can realize the compensated antiferromagnetic configurations with QAHE. Our findings illustrate the realization of QAHE in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and provide a reliable strategy to obtain the corresponding magnetic configurations.</p>

Our finding presented here offers a first exact derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution in the dynamics of the interacting quantum model not being mapped to a noninteracting fermion Hamiltonian via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. On the basis of the exact solution of the folded XXZ model and our numerical analysis of the XXZ model, we discuss a universal behavior for the probability of finding the left-most up-spin in the XXZ model.</p>

            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenide moiré homobilayers have emerged as a platform in which magnetism, strong correlations, and topology are intertwined. In a large magnetic field, the energetic alignment of states with different spin in these systems is dictated by both strong Zeeman splitting and the structure of the Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum, yet the latter has been difficult to probe experimentally. Here we conduct local thermodynamic measurements of twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers that reveal a cascade of magnetic phase transitions. We understand these transitions as the filling of individual Hofstadter subbands, allowing us to extract the structure and connectivity of the Hofstadter spectrum of a single spin. The onset of magnetic transitions is independent of twist angle, indicating that the exchange interactions of the component layers are only weakly modified by the moiré potential. In contrast, the magnetic transitions are associated with stark changes in the insulating states at commensurate filling. Our work achieves a spin-resolved measurement of Hofstadter's butterfly despite overlapping states, and it disentangles the role of material and moiré effects on the nature of the correlated ground states.</p>

            <p>Spin-driven multiferroics exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling, with notable polarization changes under a magnetic field, but these effects are usually limited to high-Z magnetic insulators with low electronic polarization. In this work, we introduce altermagnets as a promising platform for achieving strong magnetoelectric coupling in low-Z systems with substantial polarization. This large polarization arises from a design principle that utilizes the Heisenberg-like exchange striction mechanism, eliminating the reliance on spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This approach enables the Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic phase derived from altermagnetic insulators to achieve substantial polarization without spin splitting, providing a flexible platform for regulating spin-splitting phenomena. Through first-principles simulations and an effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that materials in the LiMnO2 family and strained RuF4 family can achieve polarization values exceeding 1.0 {\mu}C/cm2, an order of magnitude larger than those found in SOC-driven multiferroics. Moreover, their magnetoelectric coupling is one to two orders of magnitude stronger than that observed in conventional multiferroics and those driven by SOC.</p>

            <p>Electrical breakdown in a dielectric capacitor occurs when the electric field strength across the dielectric material exceeds its breakdown strength. A conductive channel through the dielectric emerges, resulting in a sudden surge of current. Self-healing represents a phenomenon of restoration of a capacitor's performance. The efficiency of self-healing depends on the products of high-temperature decomposition of the electrode and dielectric. We report atomistic simulations of the soot's chemical composition in the case of gold electrodes and four popular dielectric polymers: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), and polyimide (PI). We unravel that gold atoms form clusters within the carbon-rich soot, limiting their interactions with non-metal elements. The oxygen atoms of PET, PC, and PI act as stabilizers of gold thanks to electrostatic attraction. Compared to zinc, gold equalizes the soot conductivity in all samples but does not impact polymer gasification. The suitability of dielectrics for self-healing must be rated based on the volatile by-products: PP > PC > PET > PI. Mind that PP issues three times more gases than PI. Therefore, the size of semiconducting soot is substantially smaller in the case of PP than in the case of PI. The obtained numerical results provide unprecedented physical insights into the phenomenon of self-healing and clearly drive the efforts to extend the lifespans of the metalized film capacitors.</p>

            <h2>A Universal Method to Transform Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules into Confined Carbyne inside Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingzhi Chen, Kunpeng Tang, Wendi Zhang, Huiju Cao, Hongwei Zhang, Yanghao Feng, Weili Cui, Yuan Hu, Lei Shi, Guowei Yang</p>
            <p>Carbyne, a sp1-hybridized allotrope of carbon, is a linear carbon chain with exceptional theoretically predicted properties that surpass those of sp2-hybridized graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). However, the existence of carbyne has been debated due to its instability caused by Peierls distortion, which limits its practical development. The only successful synthesis of carbyne has been achieved inside CNTs, resulting in a form known as confined carbyne (CC). However, CC can only be synthesized inside multi-walled CNTs, limiting its property-tuning capabilities to the inner tubes of the CNTs. Here, we present a universal method for synthesizing CC inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm. Aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are filled inside SWCNTs and subsequently transformed into CC under low-temperature annealing. A variety of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are confirmed as effective precursors for formation of CC, with Raman frequencies centered around 1861 cm-1. Enriched (6,5) and (7,6) SWCNTs with diameters less than 0.8 nm are less effective than the SWCNTs with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm for CC formation. Furthermore, resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals that optical band gap of the CC at 1861 cm-1 is 2.353 eV, which is consistent with the result obtained using a linear relationship between the Raman signal and optical band gap. This newly developed approach provides a versatile route for synthesizing CC from various precursor molecules inside diverse templates, which is not limited to SWCNTs but could extend to any templates with appropriate size, including molecular sieves, zeolites, boron nitride nanotubes, and metal-organic frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Insulator and Electrode Materials Marginally Influence Carbonized Layer Conductivity in Metalized-Film Capacitors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vitaly V. Chaban, Nadezhda Andreeva</p>
            <p>Capacitor self-healing is a generalized term to describe physical and chemical processes restoring the functionalities of a dielectric capacitor after an electrical breakdown. The efficacy of self-healing depends on the elemental composition of a metalized-film capacitor. We report atomistic simulations of self-healing from a chemical perspective proving the impossibility of tuning the electrical conductivity of the soot by finding an interplay of various polymers and electrodes. All investigated soot samples turn out to possess carbon-rich semiconducting skeletons with numerous unsaturated C-C covalent bonds. They exhibit electrical conductivities of the same order of magnitude, irrespective of initial chemical compositions and properties of the chosen insulating polymers. Upon reporting the new results, we discuss less evident approaches to diminish the soot conductivity. We conclude that the quality of capacitor self-healing can be assessed by counting gaseous by-products of electrical breakdown or evaluating the volume of the solid-state semiconducting counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Machine learning the Renyi entropy of multiple disjoint intervals with neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han-Qing Shi, Hai-Qing Zhang</p>
            <p>Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals are computed from the improved swapping operations by two methods: one is from the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and the other one is from the state-of-the-art machine learning method with neural networks. We use the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model in one-dimension to demonstrate the strategy of the improved swapping operation. In particular, we study the second Renyi entropy with two, three and four disjoint intervals. We find that the results from the above two methods match each other very well within errors, which indicates that the machine learning method is applicable for calculating the Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals. Moreover, as the magnetic field increases, the Renyi entropy grows as well until the system arrives at the critical point of the phase transition. However, as the magnetic field exceeds the critical value, the Renyi entropy will decrease since the system enters the paramagnetic phase. Overall, these results match the theoretical predictions very well and demonstrate the high accuracy of the machine learning methods with neural networks.</p>

            <h2>On the band topology of the breathing kagome lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clara K. Geschner, Adam Yanis Chaou, Vatsal Dwivedi, Piet W. Brouwer</p>
            <p>A two-dimensional second-order topological insulator exhibits topologically protected zero-energy states at its corners. In the literature, the breathing kagome lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping is often mentioned as an example of a two-dimensional second-order topological insulator. Here we show by explicit construction that the corner states of the breathing kagome lattice can be removed by a continuous change of the hopping parameters, without breaking any of the model's symmetries, without closing bulk and boundary gaps, and without introducing hopping terms not present in the original model. Furthermore, we topologically classify all three-band lattice models with the same crystalline symmetries as the breathing kagome lattice and show that though none of the phases have protected zero-energy corner states, some of the phases are obstructed atomic limits which exhibit a filling anomaly.</p>
