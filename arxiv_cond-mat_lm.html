            <h2>Strong ergodicity breaking in dynamical mean-field equations for mixed p-spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Citro, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi</p>
            <p>The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical (3+4)-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for strong ergodicity breaking in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed p-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics takes place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.</p>

            <h2>Learning transitions in classical Ising models and deformed toric codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Pütz, Samuel J. Garratt, Hidetoshi Nishimori, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a sharp learning transition for the two-dimensional classical Ising model, all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our results can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Best practices in Quantum Monte Carlo for metal catalysis: CO hydrolysis on Pt(111)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Bagci, Philip E Hoggan</p>
            <p>Hydrogen production as a clean, sustainable replacement for fossil fuels is gathering pace. Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{ö}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face. Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.</p>

            <h2>Surface charge density wave in UTe2</h2>

            <p>The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the electron and lattice bandstructures that facilitate charge ordering. CDWs are often considered to compete with Kondo screening and are relatively rare in heavy fermion metals. However, the heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe2 presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe2. This allows for a refined identification of the electronic bandstructure regions susceptible to nesting. We demonstrate that the CDW wavevectors are not linked to bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have been connected to other nesting features, indicating a decoupling from the bulk. We propose that surface-induced modifications of the U-5f electronic structure result in an enhancement of electronic interactions specifically at the nesting wavevectors identified here, thereby driving the formation of the observed surface CDW.</p>

            <h2>Observation of the Axion quasiparticle in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</h2>

            <p>In 1978, Wilczek and Weinberg theoretically discovered a new boson-the Axion-which is the coherent oscillation of the $\theta$ field in QCD. Its existence can solve multiple fundamental questions including the strong CP problem of QCD and the dark matter. However, its detection is challenging because it has almost no interaction with existing particles. Similar $\theta$ has been introduced to condensed matter and so far studied as a static, quantized value to characterize topology of materials. But the coherent oscillation of $\theta$ in condensed matter is proposed to lead to new physics directly analogous to the high-energy Axion particle, the dynamical Axion quasiparticle (DAQ). In this paper, we present the direct observation of the DAQ. By combining 2D electronic device with ultrafast pump-probe optics, we manage to measure the magnetoelectric coupling $\theta$ ($\theta\propto\alpha$) of 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with sub-picosecond time-resolution. This allows us to directly observe the DAQ by seeing a coherent oscillation of $\theta$ at ~44 GHz in real time, which is uniquely induced by the out-of-phase antiferromagnetic magnon. Interestingly, in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, the DAQ arises from the magnon-induced coherent modulation of Berry curvature. Such ultrafast control of quantum wavefunction can be generalized to manipulate Berry curvature and quantum metric of other materials in ultrafast time-scale. Moreover, the DAQ enables novel quantum physics such as Axion polariton and electric control of ultrafast spin polarization, implying applications in unconventional light-matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Beyond condensed matter, the DAQ can serve as a detector of the dark matter Axion particle. We estimate the detection frequency range and sensitivity in the critically-lacking meV regime, contributing to one of the most challenging questions in fundamental physics.</p>

            <h2>Boundary criticality in two-dimensional interacting topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Ge, Hong Yao, Shao-Kai Jian</p>
            <p>We study the boundary criticality in 2D interacting topological insulators. Using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we present the first nonperturbative study of the boundary quantum phase diagram in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard-Rashba model. Our results reveal rich boundary critical phenomena at the quantum phase transition between a topological insulator and an antiferromagnetic insulator, encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Combining analytical derivation of the boundary theory with unbiased numerically-exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of topological edge states enriches the ordinary transition that renders a continuous boundary scaling dimension and, more intriguingly, leads to a special transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Our work establishes a novel framework for the nonperturbative study of boundary criticality in two-dimensional topological systems with strong electron correlations.</p>

            <h2>Current-driven dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wooyon Kim, Jun Seok Seo, Se Kwon Kim</p>
            <p>Domain-wall skyrmions are magnetic solitons embedded in a domain wall that are topologically equivalent to skyrmions. Here, we theoretically study antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions and their current-driven motion within the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenology, and verify our findings with micromagnetic simulations. While the skyrmion Hall effect is expected to be suppressed in the current-induced motion of antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions, we observe a finite Hall angle, which originates from the anisotropic spin configuration of domain-wall skyrmions. The skyrmion Hall effect is, however, conditionally suppressed and the motion aligns with the current applied in certain directions, which can be interpreted as principal axes of a domain-wall skyrmion that is easily identified from the symmetry of the spin configuration. Our work on antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions shows that the dynamics of spin textures endowed with multiple soliton characteristics can be unconventional, which is envisaged to enrich the field of topological solitons.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear spin dynamics across Néel phase transition in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic multilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. Busel, D. Polishchuk, A. Kravets, V. Korenivski</p>
            <p>We observe strongly nonlinear spin dynamics in ferro-/antiferro-magnetic multilayers, controlled by the number of bilayers in the system, layer thicknesses, as well as temperature, peaking in magnitude near the Néel point of the antiferromagnetic layers just above room temperature. Well above the Néel transition, the individual ferromagnetic layers are exchange decoupled and resonate independently. As the temperature is lowered toward the Néel point, the ferromagnetic proximity effect through the thin antiferromagnetic spacers transforms the system into a weakly coupled macrospin chain along the film normal, which exhibits pronounced standing spin-wave resonance modes, comparable in intensity to the uniform resonance in the ferromagnetic layers. These findings are supported by our micromagnetic simulations showing clear spin-wave profiles with precessional phase lag along the macrospin chain. Well below the Néel transition, the FeMn layers order strongly antiferromagnetically and exchange-pin the ferromagnetic layers to effectively make the multilayer one macrospin. The appearance and intensity of the high-frequency spin-wave modes can thus be conveniently controlled by thermal gating the multilayer. The nonlinearity in the microwave response of the demonstrated material can approach 100\%, large compared to nonlinear materials used in e.g. optics, with second-harmonic generation often at the single percentage level.</p>

            <h2>Photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the cubic Kondo-lattice model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo Hamano, Masahito Mochizuki</p>
            <p>We theoretically study photoinduced magnetic phase transitions and their dynamical processes in the Kondo-lattice model on a cubic lattice. It is demonstrated that light irradiation gives rise to magnetic phase transitions from the ground-state ferromagnetic state to a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic state as a nonequilibrium steady state in the photodriven system. This phase transition occurs as a consequence of the formation of pseudo half-filling band occupation via the photoexcitation and relaxation of electrons, where all the electron states constituting the lower band separated from the upper band by an exchange gap are partially but nearly uniformly occupied. We also find that several types of antiferromagnetic correlations, e.g., A-type and C-type antiferromagnetic correlations, appear in a transient state of the dynamical phase transition. By calculating magnon spectra for the photodriven system, we argue that the instability to the A-type or C-type antiferromagnetic state occurs in the ferromagnetic ground state as a softening of the magnon band dispersion at corresponding momentum points depending on the light polarization. Our findings provide important insights into the understanding of photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the three-dimensional Kondo-lattice magnets.</p>

            <h2>Magnetism-Enhanced Strong Electron-Phonon Coupling in Infinite-Layer Nickelate</h2>

            <p>Intriguing analogies between the nickelates and the cuprates provide a promising avenue for unraveling the microscopic mechanisms underlying high-$T_c$ superconductivity. While electron correlation effects in the nickelates have been extensively studied, the role of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) remains highly controversial. Here, by taking pristine LaNiO$_2$ as an exemplar nickelate, we present an in-depth study of EPC for both the non-magnetic (NM) and the $C$-type antiferromagnetic ($C$-AFM) phase using advanced density functional theory methods without invoking $U$ or other free parameters. The weak EPC strength $\lambda$ in the NM phase is found to be greatly enhanced ($\sim$4$\times$) due to the presence of magnetism in the $C$-AFM phase. This enhancement arises from strong interactions between the flat bands associated with the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals and the low-frequency phonon modes driven by the vibrations of Ni and La atoms. The resulting phonon softening is shown to yield a distinctive kink in the electronic structure around 15 meV, which would provide an experimentally testable signature of our predictions. Our study highlights the critical role of local magnetic moments and interply EPC in the nickelate.</p>

            <h2>Many-body cages: disorder-free glassiness from flat bands in Fock space, and many-body Rabi oscillations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Ben-Ami, Markus Heyl, Roderich Moessner</p>
            <p>We identify the many-body counterpart of flat bands, which we call many-body caging, as a general mechanism for non-equilibrium phenomena such as a novel type of glassy eigenspectrum order and many-body Rabi oscillations in the time domain. We focus on constrained systems of great current interest in the context of Rydberg atoms and synthetic or emergent gauge theories. We find that their state graphs host motifs which produce flat bands in the many-body spectrum at a particular set of energies. Basis states in Fock space exhibit Edwards-Anderson type parameters in the absence of quenched disorder, with an intricate, possibly fractal, distribution over Fock space which is reflected in a distinctive structure of a non-vanishing post-quench long-time Loschmidt echo, an experimentally accessible this http URL general, phenomena familiar from single-particle flat bands manifest themselves in characteristic many-body incarnations, such as a reentrant `Anderson' delocalisation, offering a rich ensemble of experimental signatures in the abovementioned quantum simulators. The variety of single-particle flat band types suggests an analogous typology--and concomitant phenomenological richness to be explored--of their many-body counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Topologically enabled superconductivity: possible implications for rhombohedral graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesca Paoletti, Daniele Guerci, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Urban F.P. Seifert, Elio J. König</p>
            <p>We present a topological mechanism for superconductivity emerging from Chern-2 insulators. While, naively, time-reversal symmetry breaking is expected to prevent superconductivity, it turns out that the opposite is the case: An explicit model calculation for a generalized attractive-U Haldane-Hubbard model demonstrates that superconductivity is only stabilized near the quantum anomalous Hall state, but not near a trivial, time-reversal symmetric band insulator. As standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like mean-field theory fails to capture any superconducting state, we explain this using an effective fractionalized field theory involving fermionic chargeons, bosonic colorons and an emergent U(1) gauge field. When the chargeons form a gapped topological band structure, the proliferation of single monopoles of this gauge field is forbidden. However, long-ranged monopole-antimonopole correlations emerge, and we argue that those correspond to superconducting order. Using random phase approximation on top of extensive slave-rotor mean-field calculations we characterize coherence length and stiffness of the superconductor. Thereby, we deduce the phase diagram in parameter space and furthermore discuss the effect of doping, temperature and an external magnetic field. We complement the fractionalized theory with calculations using an effective spin model and Gutzwiller projected wavefunctions. While mostly based on a simple toy model, we argue that our findings contribute to a better understanding of superconductivity emerging out of spin- and valley polarized rhombohedral graphene multilayers in a parameter regime with nearby quantum anomalous Hall insulators.</p>

            <h2>Causality, localisation, and universality of monitored quantum walks with long-range hopping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayan Roy, Shamik Gupta, Giovanna Morigi</p>
            <p>Quantum resetting protocols can speed up the time in which a quantum walker reaches a target site on a lattice. In these setups, a detector monitors the target site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked after a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from the time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked up to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $d$, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays with a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\alpha$. At short times, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of $\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal resetting rate. For $\alpha>1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by the velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice. For $\alpha<1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localise the walker: The optimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as $\alpha\to 0$. We derive simple models reproducing the numerical results, shedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries, and local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium. Our predictions can be verified in existing experimental setups.</p>

            <h2>Resonances in reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Namu Kroupa, Gábor Csányi, Will Handley</p>
            <p>In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes, the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Finding periodic orbits in projected quantum many-body dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elena Petrova, Marko Ljubotina, Gökhan Yalnız, Maksym Serbyn</p>
            <p>Describing general quantum many-body dynamics is a challenging task due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size. The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) provides a powerful tool to tackle this task by projecting quantum evolution onto a classical dynamical system within a variational manifold. In classical systems, periodic orbits play a crucial role in understanding the structure of the phase space and the long-term behavior of the system. However, finding periodic orbits is generally difficult, and their existence and properties in generic TDVP dynamics over matrix product states have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an algorithm to systematically identify and characterize periodic orbits in TDVP dynamics. Applying our method to the periodically kicked Ising model, we uncover both stable and unstable periodic orbits. We characterize the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori in the vicinity of stable periodic orbits and track the change of the periodic orbits as we modify the Hamiltonian parameters. We observe that periodic orbits exist at any value of the coupling constant between prethermal and fully thermalizing regimes, but their relevance to quantum dynamics and imprint on quantum eigenstates diminishes as the system leaves the prethermal regime. Our results demonstrate that periodic orbits provide valuable insights into the TDVP approximation of quantum many-body evolution and establish a closer connection between quantum and classical chaos.</p>

            <p>The motion of a quantum particle in a one-dimensional periodic potential can be described in terms of Bloch wave packets. Like free-particle wave packets, they can propagate without attenuation. Here, we examine this similarity more closely by investigating whether Bloch wave packets can maintain a definite -- or nearly definite -- momentum direction, a property inherent to free-particle wave packets. This question is particularly relevant to the feasibility of using solid-state-based systems in the search for the first experimental realization of quantum backflow, a quantum interference effect in which a particle's probability density flows in a direction opposite to its momentum.</p>

            <h2>Generalization through variance: how noise shapes inductive biases in diffusion models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John J. Vastola</p>
            <p>How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy. We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions, but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive biases.</p>

            <h2>Topologically Directed Simulations Reveal the Impact of Geometric Constraints on Knotted Proteins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agnese Barbensi, Alexander R. Klotz, Dimos Gkountaroulis</p>
            <p>Simulations of knotting and unknotting in polymers or other filaments rely on random processes to facilitate topological changes. Here we introduce a method of \textit{topological steering} to determine the optimal pathway by which a filament may knot or unknot while subject to a given set of physics. The method involves measuring the knotoid spectrum of a space curve projected onto many surfaces and computing the mean unravelling number of those projections. Several perturbations of a curve can be generated stochastically, e.g. using the Langevin equation or crankshaft moves, and a gradient can be followed that maximises or minimises the topological complexity. We apply this method to a polymer model based on a growing self-avoiding tangent-sphere chain, which can be made to model proteins by imposing a constraint that the bending and twisting angles between successive spheres must maintain the distribution found in naturally occurring protein structures. We show that without these protein-like geometric constraints, topologically optimised polymers typically form alternating torus knots and composites thereof, similar to the stochastic knots predicted for long DNA. However, when the geometric constraints are imposed on the system, the frequency of twist knots increases, similar to the observed abundance of twist knots in protein structures.</p>

            <h2>Combining the Maximum Overlap Method with Multiwavelets for Core-Ionisation Energy Calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas Göllmann, Matthew R. Ludwig, Peter Wind, Laura Ratcliff, Luca Frediani</p>
            <p>We present a protocol for computing core-ionisation energies for molecules, which is essential for reproducing X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The electronic structure of both the ground state and the core-ionised states are computed using Multiwavelets and Density-Functional Theory, where the core ionisation energies are computed by virtue of the $\Delta$SCF method. To avoid the collapse of the core-hole state or its delocalisation, we make use of the Maximum Overlap Method, which provides a constraint on the orbital occupation. Combining Multiwavelets with the Maximum Overlap Method allows for the first time an all-electron calculation of core-ionisation energies with Multiwavelets, avoiding known issues connected to the use of Atomic Orbitals (slow convergence with respect to the basis set limit, numerical instabilities of core-hole states for large systems). We show that our results are consistent with previous Multiwavelet calculations which made use of pseudopotentials, and are generally more precise than corresponding Atomic Orbital calculations. We analyse the results in terms of precision compared to both Atomic Orbital calculations and Multiwavelets+pseudopotentials calculations. Moreover, we demonstrate how the protocol can be applied to target molecules of relatively large size. Both closed-shell and open-shell methods have been implemented.</p>

            <p>We propose a straightforward mechanism for achieving unique $k$-space resonance modes in one-dimensional time-varying cavities where periodic temporal modulation creates momentum band gaps through Floquet dynamics. By engineering the synergy between cavity resonance conditions and Floquet mode formation in photonic time crystals, we demonstrate the emergence of a single dominant momentum state that exhibits remarkable robustness against temporal disorder. Through analytical modeling and numerical verification, we show that the interplay between time-varying medium and cavity boundary conditions leads to amplification of specific waves followed by spatial mode selection. This engineered resonance mechanism enables insensitivity to initial wave source configuration and strong temporal disorder immunity.

            <h2>Exact Learning Dynamics of In-Context Learning in Linear Transformers and Its Application to Non-Linear Transformers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nischal Mainali, Lucas Teixeira</p>
            <p>Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure, leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops, including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.</p>

Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle parameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry.

            <p>Integrating solid-state spin defects into classical electronic devices can enable new opportunities for quantum information processing that benefit from existing semiconductor technology. We show, through bias control of an isotopically purified silicon carbide (SiC) p-i-n diode, the depletion of not only electrical noise sources but also magnetic noise sources, resulting in record coherences for SiC electron spin qubits. We also uncover complementary improvements to the relaxation times of nuclear spin registers controllable by the defect, and measure diode-enhanced coherences. These improvements lead to record-long nuclear spin Hahn-echo times on the scale of minutes. These results demonstrate the power of materials control and electronic device integration to create highly coherent solid-state quantum network nodes and processors.</p>

            <h2>Simulating the anharmonic phonon spectrum in critical systems: self-consistent phonons and temperature-dependent effective potential methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Monacelli</p>
            <p>Understanding and simulating the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of materials affected by strong ionic anharmonicity is a central challenge in material science. Much interest is in material displaying critical displacive behaviour, such as near a ferroelectric transition, charge-density waves, or in general displacive second-order transitions. In these cases, molecular dynamics suffer from a critical slowdown and emergent long-range fluctuations of the order parameter. Two prominent methods have emerged to solve this issue: Self-consistent renormalization of the phonons like the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) and Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP), and methods that fit the potential energy landscape from short molecular dynamics trajectories, like the Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP). Despite their widespread use, the limitations of these methods are often overlooked in the proximity of critical points. Here, we establish a guiding rule set for the accuracy of each method on critical quantities: free energy for computing the phase diagrams, static correlation functions for inferring phase stability and critical behaviours, and dynamic correlation functions for vibrational spectra and thermal transport. Also, a new TDEP implementation is introduced to fix the calculation of dynamical spectra, restoring the correct perturbative limit violated by the standard TDEP approach. Results are benchmarked both against an exact one-dimensional anharmonic potential and two prototypical anharmonic crystals: the ferroelectric PbTe and the metal-halide perovskite CsSnI3.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R.A. Abramchuk, M.A.Zubkov</p>
            <p>Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is typically considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME). The relation between these two phenomena has the status of a hypothesis and is based on sequence of assumptions. We rely on the Keldysh technique of non-equilibrium theory. It allows us to investigate the accumulation of axial charge -- the process that involves both chiral anomaly and relaxation followed by the energy dissipation. We consider the case of strong magnetic field and calculate directly both axial charge density and electric conductivity taking into account both scattering on impurities and interaction with phonons. We obtain the same dependence of axial charge density on electric and magnetic fields, and the same dependence of electric current on axial charge density as the standard heuristic CME calculation. This confirms (in the limit of strong magnetic fields) the hypothesis that the origin of magnetoconductivity in Dirac semimetals is the CME.</p>

            <p>We have analytically explored both the zero temperature and the finite temperature scaling theory for the collapse of an attractively interacting 3-D harmonically trapped Bose gas in a synthetic magnetic field. We have considered short-ranged (contact) attractive inter-particle interactions and Hartree-Fock approximation for the same. We have separately studied the collapse of both the condensate and the thermal cloud below and above the condensation point, respectively. We have obtained an anisotropy, artificial magnetic field, and temperature-dependent critical number of particles for the collapse of the condensate. We have found a dramatic change in the critical exponent (from $\alpha=1$ to $0$) of the specific heat ($C_v\propto|T-T_c|^{\alpha}$) when the thermal cloud is about to collapse with the critical number of particles ($N=N_c$) just below and above the condensation point.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han-Xiang Xu, Daniel Guterding</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p>

            <p>The role of spin orbit interaction in superconducting proximity effect is an area of intense research effort. Recent theoretical and experimental works investigate the possible role of spin-orbit interaction in generating spin-triplet pair correlations. In this work, we present an experimental survey of thin normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers with Nb superconductor and Al, Ti, Cu, Pt, Ta, and Au normal metals, along with single layers of Nb as reference. We aim to probe the role of spin-orbit interaction and resistivity on the normal metal proximity effect through measurements of the upper critical field. We find that the upper critical fields of the trilayers are lower than that of a single layer Nb reference sample, and that the trilayers with higher resistivity metals, Ti, Pt, and Ta, behave as 2-dimensional superconductors. At low applied in-plane magnetic fields and temperatures close to the zero field transition temperature, we find a possible deviation from 2-dimensional to 3-dimensional behavior in the Ti and Pt trilayers. We also find that compared to single layer Nb films, all of our trilayers show a greater suppression of critical temperature during rotation from an in-plane to an out-of-plane applied magnetic field, with the greatest suppression observed in trilayers with Au or Al. This suppression of the critical temperature under field rotation might appear analogous to the colossal spin valve effect that can be achieved in systems with ferromagnetic materials; however, in our trilayers, only conventional orbital screening contributions to the suppression are present and the additional suppression is not present in the absence of applied magnetic field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Teza, John Bechhoefer, Antonio Lasanta, Oren Raz, Marija Vucelja</p>
            <p>Most of our intuition about the behavior of physical systems is shaped by observations at or near thermal equilibrium. However, even a thermal quench can lead to states far from thermal equilibrium, where counterintuitive, anomalous effects can occur. A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxation is the Mpemba effect, in which a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down to the temperature of the cold environment faster than an identical system prepared at a warm temperature. Although reported for water more than 2000 years ago by Aristotle, the recent observations of analogous relaxation speedups in a variety of systems have motivated the search for general explanations. We review anomalous relaxation effects, which all share a nonmonotonic dependence of relaxation time versus initial ``distance" from the final state or from the phase transition. The final state can be an equilibrium or a nonequilibrium steady state. We first review the water experiments and classify the anomalous relaxation phenomena related to the Mpemba effect. We then provide a modern definition of the Mpemba effect, focusing on the theoretical frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, kinetic theory, Markovian dynamics, and phase transitions. We discuss the recent experimental and numerical developments that followed these theoretical advances. These developments paved the way for the prediction and observation of novel phenomena, such as the inverse Mpemba effect. The review is self-contained and introduces anomalous relaxation phenomena in single- and many-body systems, both classical and quantum. We also discuss the broader relevance of the Mpemba effect, including its relation with phase transitions and its experimental implications. We end with perspectives that connect anomalous speedups to ideas for designing optimal heating/cooling protocols, heat engines, and efficient samplers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wesley Roberts, Michael Vogl, Roderich Moessner, Gregory A. Fiete</p>
            <p>We present an approximation scheme based on selective Hilbert space truncation for characterizing non-thermal states of magnetic systems beyond spin-wave theory. We study applications to states that are inaccessible through linear spin-wave theory, such as multi-magnon states and higher-energy states. Our approach is based on the existence of an exact representation of spin operators in terms of finite-order polynomials of bosonic operators. It can be applied to systems with and without a magnetically ordered ground state. The approximation exactly diagonalizes the bosonic Hamiltonian restricted to particular boson occupation subspaces, improving the conventional linear spin-wave approach and exponentially reducing the computing time relative to exact diagonalization schemes. As a test case, we apply the approach to a prototypical one-dimensional model - an XXZ spin chain with an applied magnetic field and antisymmetric exchange coupling. Here the antisymmetric coupling introduces a continuous parameter to tune the system away from its exactly solvable limit. We find excellent agreement between numerically exact eigenstates and eigenvalues and those found via the approximation scheme. Our approach applies not just to higher lying states but also to boson bound states, which could make them more accessible to theoretical predictions for comparison with experiment.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Current-induced Zero-Resistance State in Valley-Polarized Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akito Daido, Youichi Yanase, Kam Tuen Law</p>
            <p>The recently observed nonreciprocal current-induced zero-resistance state (CIZRS) in twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure has posed a significant theoretical challenge. Therein, the system shows a zero-resistance state only when a sufficiently large current is applied in a particular direction, while stays in an incipient superconducting state with small resistance when the current is small or in the opposite direction. In this Letter, we provide a theory for this phenomenon using a model that encapsulates valley polarization and trigonal warping inherent to the trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure. We elucidate that threefold-degenerate Fulde-Ferrell (FF) states are stabilized, and establish the thermodynamic phase diagram in electric current that manifests the switching behavior of different FF states. We thereby propose a scenario that predicts CIZRS in the presence of domains of different FF states: The incipient superconducting state in small current is naturally understood as a multi-domain state, wherein the inter-domain supercurrent is difficult to flow due to the tiny Josephson coupling caused by the mismatch of Cooper-pair momenta. Nevertheless, a sufficiently large current in a particular direction can selectively populate a certain FF state and create mono-domain pathways with zero resistance. Crucially, due to the threefold symmetry of the system, a current flowing in the opposite direction fails to generate these zero-resistance pathways, thus giving rise to the observed nonreciprocity. Finally, we suggest that the long-sought-after triangular finite-momentum state can also be realized in valley-polarized superconductors.</p>

            <p>We revealed the resistive switching, negative differential resistance and charge accumulation effects in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method and annealed at temperatures from 500°C to 800°C. The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600°C to 800°C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Schnell</p>
            <p>This work makes progress on the issue of global vs. local master equations. Global master equations like the Redfield master equation (following from standard Born and Markov approximation) require a full diagonalization of the system Hamiltonian. This is especially challenging for interacting quantum many-body systems. We discuss a short-bath-correlation-time expansion in reciprocal (energy) space, leading to a series expansion of the jump operator, which avoids a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. For a bath that is coupled locally to one site, this typically leads to an expansion of the global Redfield jump operator in terms of local operators. We additionally map the local Redfield master equation to a novel local Lindblad form, giving an equation which has the same conceptual advantages of traditional local Lindblad approaches, while being applicable in a much broader class of systems. Our ideas give rise to a non-heuristic foundation of local master equations, which can be combined with established many-body methods.</p>

            <p>Introducing disorderness in the superconducting materials has been considered promising to enhance the electromagnetic impedance and realize noise-resilient superconducting qubits. Despite a number of pioneering implementations, the understanding of the correlation between the material disorderness and the qubit coherence is still developing. Here, we demonstrate a systematic characterization of fluxonium qubits with the superinductors made from titanium-aluminum-nitride with varied disorderness. From qubit noise spectroscopy, the flux noise and the dielectric loss are extracted as a measure of the coherence properties. Our results reveal that the $1/f$ flux noise dominates the qubit decoherence around the flux-frustration point, strongly correlated with the material disorderness; while the dielectric loss remains low under a wide range of material properties. From the flux-noise amplitudes, the areal density ($\sigma$) of the phenomenological spin defects and material disorderness are found to be approximately correlated by $\sigma \propto \rho_{xx}^3$, or effectively $(k_F l)^{-3}$. This work has provided new insights on the origin of decoherence channels within superconductors, and could serve as a useful guideline for material design and optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Tononi, Maciej Lewenstein</p>
            <p>Analyzing the spreading of information in many-body systems is crucial to understanding their quantum dynamics. At the most fundamental level, this task is accomplished by Bell inequalities, whose violation by quantum mechanics implies that information cannot always be stored locally. While Bell-like inequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in which two parties perform measurements on systems at different positions, one could formulate temporal inequalities, in which the two parties measure at different times. However, for causally-connected measurement events, these extensions are compatible with a local description, so that no intrinsically-quantum information spreading is involved in such temporal correlations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two spins is violated for a nonzero time interval between the measurements if the two measured parties are connected by a spin chain. Since the chain constitutes the sole medium for the spreading of quantum information, it prevents the immediate vanishing of Bell correlations after the first measurement and it induces violation revivals. The dynamics we analyze shows that, as expected in a non-relativistic setup, the spreading of information is fundamentally limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound. New insights on many-body quantum dynamics could emerge through future applications of our temporal Bell inequality to more general systems.</p>

            <p>Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effective framework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamical electromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities.</p>

            <p>Solving for the time evolution of a many particle system whose dynamics is governed by Lindblad equation is hard. We extend the use of the transfer matrix approach to a class of Lindblad equations that admit a closed hierarchy of two point correlators. An example that we treat is the XX spin chain, i.e., free fermions, subject to the local on-site dephasing, but can be extended to other Hermitian dissipators, e.g., non-local dephasing. We find a simple expression of the Green's function in the Laplace domain. The method can be used to get analytical results in the thermodynamic limit, for instance, to get the evolution of the magnetization density and to explicitly see the crossover between ballistic and diffusive behavior, or to show that the correlations between operators at distance $l$ decay with time as $1/t^{\lceil l/2 \rceil+1/2}$. It also provides a fast numerical method to determine the evolution of the density with a complexity scaling with the system size more favorably than in previous methods, easily allowing one to study systems with $\sim 10^6$ spins.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Entao Yang, Xiaotian Zhang, Yue Shang, Ge Zhang</p>
            <p>One of the central challenges in modern machine learning is understanding how neural networks generalize knowledge learned from training data to unseen test data. While numerous empirical techniques have been proposed to improve generalization, a theoretical understanding of the mechanism of generalization remains elusive. Here we introduce the concept of Boltzmann entropy into neural networks by re-conceptualizing such networks as hypothetical molecular systems where weights and biases are atomic coordinates, and the loss function is the potential energy. By employing molecular simulation algorithms, we compute entropy landscapes as functions of both training loss and test accuracy (or test loss), on networks with up to 1 million parameters, across four distinct machine learning tasks: arithmetic question, real-world tabular data, image recognition, and language modeling. Our results reveal the existence of high-entropy advantage, wherein high-entropy network states generally outperform those reached via conventional training techniques like stochastic gradient descent. This entropy advantage provides a thermodynamic explanation for neural network generalizability: the generalizable states occupy a larger part of the parameter space than its non-generalizable analog at low train loss. Furthermore, we find this advantage more pronounced in narrower neural networks, indicating a need for different training optimizers tailored to different sizes of networks.</p>

The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.</p>

            <h2>Instability of the critical Ngai's coupling and two-boson mechanism in metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Phu Nguyen, Vladyslav Kozii</p>
            <p>We study the properties of a Fermi liquid coupled to a quantum critical boson via the two-boson interaction known as Ngai's coupling. We find that the original quantum critical point is generally unstable, resulting in a finite-momentum spatially modulated state unless two conditions are satisfied: (i) the critical boson is polar and transverse, and (ii) the ratio of the Fermi velocity to the transverse-boson velocity is sufficiently large. If these conditions hold and the uniform state remains stable, we demonstrate that the system enters a strong-coupling regime below a certain energy scale. In this regime, we discuss a self-consistent solution at criticality in two-dimensional systems and show that the critical boson field develops a nontrivial anomalous dimension, $\eta=1/2$. Our findings highlight the significant role of two-boson coupling in critical theories, challenging the conventional view that its effects are subdominant to linear coupling.</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices in semiconductors are predicted to exhibit a rich variety of interaction-induced topological states. However, experimental demonstrations of such topological states, apart from MoTe2 superlattices, have remained scarce. Here, we report the first optical detection of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states in twisted WSe2 homobilayer (tWSe2). Specifically, we employ polarization-resolved attractive polaron spectroscopy on a dual-gated, 2 degree tWSe2 and observe direct signatures of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at hole filling {\nu} = 1. Together with a Chern number (C) measurement via Streda formula analysis, we identify this magnetized state as a topological state, characterized by C = 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these topological and magnetic properties are tunable via a finite displacement field, between a QAH ferromagnetic state and an antiferromagnetic state. Our findings position tWSe2 as a highly versatile, stable, and optically addressable platform for investigating topological order and strong correlations in two-dimensional landscapes.</p>

            <h2>Relation of Continuous Chirality Measure to Spin and Orbital Polarization, and Chiroptical Properties in Solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Grieder, Shihao Tu, Yuan Ping</p>
            <p>Chirality introduces intriguing topological, electronic, and optical properties to molecules and solids. In this work, we investigate the influence of structural chirality on spin and orbital polarization as well as optical activity through first-principles calculations and continuous chirality measure (CCM). By using chiral selenium (Se) and 2D hybrid perovskites as examples, we demonstrate that chirality continuously modifies spin-orbit splitting and orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization. We establish a direct relation between chirality transfer across organic-inorganic interfaces and inversion symmetry breaking, which induces Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting in hybrid perovskites. Additionally, we examine the effects of chirality on circular dichroism (CD) and the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE), demonstrating how the continuous tuning of chirality dictates their magnitude and anisotropy. Our findings highlight that applying hydrostatic pressure can effectively tune the CCM, thereby enhancing the chirality-induced effects such as spin selectivity. By integrating CCM with electronic structure calculations, we present a predictive strategy for designing chiral materials with tailored optical and spintronic functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Identifying high performance spectrally-stable quantum defects in diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yihuang Xiong, Yizhi Zhu, Shay McBride, Sinéad M. Griffin, Geoffroy Hautier</p>
            <p>Point defects in semiconductors are becoming central to quantum technologies. They can be used as spin qubits interfacing with photons, which are fundamental for building quantum networks. Currently, the most prominent quantum defect in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. However, it suffers from spectral diffusion that negatively impacts optical coherence and is due to the coupling of the emission energy with uncontrolled electric fields. The group IV vacancy complexes on the other hand have shown to be significantly more spectrally-stable as they are centrosymmetric and thus immune to the linear Stark shift. They however suffer from several issues ranging from low operation temperature to low optical efficiency due to dark states and difficulty in stabilizing the right defect charge state. Here we search for alternative to the group IV vacancy complex in diamond by systematically evaluating all possible vacancy complex using high-throughput first-principles computational screening. We identify the defects that combine centrosymmetry, emission in the visible range, as well as favorable and achievable electronic structure promoting higher operation temperature and defect levels well within the band gap. We find Zn$V^{-2}$ to be especially appealing.</p>

            <h2>Spectroscopic evidence for possible quantum spin liquid behavior in a two-dimensional Mott insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haiyang Chen, Fo-Hong Wang, Qiang Gao, Xue-Jian Gao, Zhenhua Chen, Yaobo Huang, Kam Tuen Law, Xiao Yan Xu, Peng Chen</p>
            <p>Mott insulators with localized magnetic moments will exhibit a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state when the quantum fluctuations are strong enough to suppress the ordering of the spins. Such an entangled state will give rise to collective excitations, in which spin and charge information are carried separately. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on single-layer 1T-TaS2 show a flat band around the zone center and a gap opening of about 200 meV in the low temperature, indicating 2D Mott insulating nature in the system. This flat band is dispersionless in momentum space but shows anomalously broad width around the zone center and the spectral weight decays rapidly as momentum increases. The observation is described as a spectral continuum from electron fractionalization, corroborated by a low energy effective this http URL intensity of the flat band is reduced by surface doping with magnetic adatoms and the gap is closing, a result from the interaction between spin impurities coupled with spinons and the chargons, which gives rise to a charge redistribution. Doping with nonmagnetic impurities behaves differently as the chemical potential shift dominates. These findings provide insight into the QSL states of strongly correlated electrons on 2D triangular lattices.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-Vacuum-Induced Chiral Spin Liquids in Kagome Lattices: Tuning and Probing Topological Quantum Phases via Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenan Wei, Liu Yang, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced nonlinear Hall effect by Cooper pairs near superconductor criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Hao Dong, Hui Yang, Yi Zhang</p>
            <p>Unlike the linear Hall effect that requires broken time-reversal symmetry, the nonlinear Hall effect may occur in time-reversal symmetric systems as long as there exists a non-zero Berry curvature dipole in the absence of inversion symmetry. Interestingly, the presence of time-reversal symmetry is consistent with and thus allows a direct transition into a superconducting phase. Indeed, superconductivity has been established in various nonlinear Hall materials, such as WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$, at sufficiently low temperatures. We find that the nonlinear Hall response should be significantly enhanced near the superconducting criticality, dominated by the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) contributions augmented by superconducting fluctuations, which we attribute to the Berry curvature dipole and a divergent lifetime $\tau\sim (T-T_c)^{-1}$ of the Cooper pairs, instead of the single electrons. Such a controlled enhancement brings the nonlinear Hall effect into various simple experimental observations and practical applicational potentials.</p>

            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, exhibits both maximal chaos and exact solvability, yet its entanglement entropy has never been measured experimentally. Here, we present the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer as a programmable quantum platform. We implement an optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol tailored for limited qubit connectivity to measure entanglement entropy. Additionally, we enhance the randomized measurement protocol for entropy measurement by expanding the unitary ensemble, which increases the circuit volume and pushes the capability of the near-term devices. However, we tackle this challenge by employing a quantum multi-programming strategy that parallelizes circuit execution. This work paves the way for exploring chaotic quantum dynamics and establishes scalable methods for investigating complex entanglement growth on current quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Cat states carrying long-range correlations in the many-body localized phase</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Laflorencie, Jeanne Colbois, Fabien Alet</p>
            <p>Despite considerable efforts over the last decade, the high-energy phase diagram of the random-field Heisenberg chain still eludes our understanding, in particular the nature of the non-ergodic many-body localized (MBL) regime expected at strong disorder. In this work, we revisit this paradigmatic model by studying the statistics of rare atypical events of strongly correlated spin pairs traversing the entire system. They occur for unexpectedly strong disorder, i.e., in a regime where standard estimates fail to detect any instability. We then identify these very peculiar high-energy eigenstates, which exhibit system-wide ${\cal{O}}(1)$ correlations, as nearly degenerate pairs of resonant cat states of the form $|{\Phi}_{\pm}\rangle\sim {|{\alpha_1}\rangle}\pm {|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$, where ${|{\alpha_1}\rangle}$ and ${|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$ are spin basis states. We propose a simple and generic analytical description of this new class of eigenstates that exhibit system-spanning entanglement. This analytical ansatz guides us in our search for rare hidden cat states in exponentially large many-body spectra. This also enables a systematic numerical inspection of the microscopic anatomy of these unconventional pairs, which appear in a wide range of disorder strengths. In the light of recent studies and ongoing debates on the MBL problem, our results offer new perspectives and stimulating challenges to this very active field.</p>

            <p>By integrating a dielectric microwave resonator with a piezoelectric-based strain device, we develop an in situ strain-tunable microwave spectroscopy technique that enables contactless measurements of superconducting properties under strain. In the slightly overdoped iron-based superconductor BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, we successfully observe a systematic strain dependence of the superconducting transition, manifested as changes in the quality factor and resonance frequency shifts. Both compressive and tensile anisotropic lattice distortions along the [110]${_{\rm T}}$ direction suppress superconductivity, consistent with standard transport measurements, highlighting the pivotal role of nematic fluctuations in the superconducting mechanism. Our strain-tunable cavity therefore serves as a powerful, contactless probe of fundamental superconducting material properties under strain and may also potentially facilitate the design of hybrid quantum systems with strain-controlled quantum degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bill P. Truong, Kartiek Agarwal, T. Pereg-Barnea</p>
            <p>The braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) forms the fundamental building block for topological quantum computation. Braiding protocols which involve the physical exchange of MZMs are typically envisioned on a network of topological superconducting wires. An essential component of these protocols is the transport of MZMs, which can be performed by using electric gates to locally tune sections ("piano keys") of the wire between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. In this work, we numerically simulate this piano key transport on a superconducting wire which contains either disorder (uncorrelated and correlated) or noise. We focus on the impact of these additional effects on the diabatic error, which describes unwanted transitions between the ground state and excited states. For disorder, we show that the behavior of the average diabatic error is predominantly controlled by the statistics of the minimum bulk energy gap. When the disorder is spatially correlated, we demonstrate that this leads to an increase in the diabatic error due to a further suppression of the minimum bulk energy gap and highlight the scaling of this suppression with the piano key size. For noise, we illustrate that the diabatic error is significantly enhanced due to optical transitions which depend on the minimum bulk energy gap as well as the frequency modes present in the noise. The results presented here serve to further characterize the diabatic error in disordered and noisy settings, which are important considerations in practical implementations of physical braiding schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elliott Rosenberg, Joss Ayres-Sims, Andrew Millis, David Cobden, Jiun-Haw Chu</p>
            <p>On cooling through a temperature $T_S$ of around 324 K, Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ undergoes a transition from a semimetallic state to one with a gapped electronic spectrum which is suspected to be an excitonic insulator. However, at this transition the structure also changes, from orthorhombic to monoclinic, leaving open the question of whether it is driven primarily by excitonic ordering or by a lattice instability. A lattice instability of this symmetry would correspond to softening of a B$_{2g}$ optical or acoustic phonon mode. Here, we report that elastocaloric measurements of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ with induced B$_{2g}$ strain reveal a thermodynamic susceptibility described by a Curie-Weiss law with a Curie temperature $T^*$ of 298 K. The fact that $T^*$ is close to $T_S$ rules out the possibility that the B$_{2g}$ acoustic mode is responsible for the transition. Since prior Raman measurements have shown minimal softening of the B$_{2g}$ optical mode as well, our finding strengthens the case that the transition is largely excitonic in nature. Our work underscores the potential of using strain as a tool for separating electronic and lattice contributions in phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Manipulating the optical and quantum properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials through strain engineering is not only fundamentally interesting but also provides significant benefits across various applications. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on the magnetic and optical properties of 2D topological insulators MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.</p>

            <p>Narrow and brilliant spectral lines are essential assets for high-resolution spectroscopy as well as for precision sensing and optomechanics. In semiconductor structures and, in particular, in the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system, strong emission lines with nanosecond coherence times can be provided by the opto-electronic resonances of microcavity exciton-polariton condensates. The temporal coherence of these resonances, however, normally rapidly deteriorates as the temperature increases beyond a few tens of kelvins due to exciton dissociation. Here, we demonstrate that the temperature stability of polariton condensates in (Al,Ga)As can be significantly improved by confinement within micrometer-sized intracavity traps. We show that trapped condensates can survive up to ~200 K while maintaining a light-matter character with decoherence rates below 10 GHz (i.e., $< 40 {\mu}$eV linewidths). These linewidths are by an order of magnitude smaller than those so far reported for other solid-state systems at these temperatures. Confinement thus provides a pathway towards room-temperature polariton condensation using the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system with prospects for application in scalable on-chip photonic devices for optical processing, sensing, and computing.</p>

            <p>The control of hybrid light-matter states, specifically magnon-polaritons that emerge from the strong coupling between magnons and cavity photons, remains a key challenge in developing reconfigurable quantum and classical devices. Here, we showcase the ability to remotely control antiferromagnetic magnon-polaritons at room temperature using electric field by integrating a highly birefringent liquid crystal layer into a terahertz Fabry-Pérot cavity containing an antiferromagnetic crystal. Positioned several millimeters from the magnetic material, the liquid crystal allows for adjusting the cavity's photonic environment through electric field. This adjustment, in turn, influences the coupling strength of a particular cavity mode to the magnon resonance, thereby controlling the extent of magnon dressing by cavity photons. Our approach facilitates dynamic and reversible tuning of magnon-photon hybridization without the need for direct electrical contact or alterations to the magnetic medium. These findings create the conditions for voltage-programmable terahertz magnonic devices and new possibilities for noninvasive control strategies in spin-based information processing technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deven P. Carmichael, Martin Claassen</p>
            <p>Recent studies have revealed that the quantum geometry of electronic bands determines the electromagnetic properties of non-interacting insulators and semimetals. However, the role of quantum geometry in the optical responses of interacting electron systems remains largely unexplored. Here we examine the interplay between Coulomb interactions and Bloch-band quantum geometry in clean metals. We demonstrate that the low-frequency optical conductivity of a correlated metal encodes the structure of Bloch wave functions at the Fermi surface. This response originates from integrating out highly off-resonant interband scattering processes enabled by Coulomb interactions. The resulting quantum-geometric contribution appears generically in multiband systems, but becomes the dominant effect in the optical conductivity for a parabolic band. We consider a dilute correlated metal near a topological band inversion and show that the doping dependence of optical absorption can measure how the orbital character of Bloch wave functions changes at the Fermi surface. Our results illustrate how the confluence of quantum geometry and Coulomb interactions can enable optical processes and enrich the physics of Fermi liquids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiefu Cen, Hae-Young Kee</p>
            <p>$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has attracted significant attention as a prime candidate for the spin-1/2 Kitaev spin liquid in two-dimensional honeycomb lattices. Although its ground state is magnetically ordered, the order is suppressed under a moderate in-plane magnetic field. The intermediate regime of the field has exotic behaviours, some of which are claimed to originate from a Kitaev spin liquid. In resolving debates surrounding these behaviours, the interlayer interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have been largely overlooked due to their perceived weakness in van der Waals materials. However, near the transition, they may become significant as the field energy approaches the interlayer coupling scale. Here we investigate the effects of interlayer couplings in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ structures. We first examine their effects on the transition temperature ($T_N$) using classical Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the interlayer couplings have minimal effects on $T_N$, and the different $T_N$ between the two structures are mainly due to the anisotropy in the intralayer interactions. Focusing on the $R{\bar 3}$ structure, we show that the nearest neighbour interlayer interaction is XXZ-type due to the symmetry, and the next nearest neighbor interaction of the Kitaev-type is crucial for the transition between two zigzag orders under an in-plane field. Furthermore, an intermediate phase with a large unit cell emerges due to the interlayer interactions. Our findings provide new insights into the exotic behaviours and sample dependence reported in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.</p>

            <p>This chapter explores various aspects of the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) and its implications in the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). We begin by reviewing the origin and fundamental properties of the DCE, including three equivalent mathematical frameworks that offer complementary perspectives on the phenomenon. These formulations will serve as a foundation for the subsequent analyses. We then turn our attention to the practical realization of the DCE in cQED-based architectures, discussing how modern superconducting circuits can be engineered to exhibit this inherently quantum effect. Building on this, we examine how the presence of the DCE influences the performance of a quantum thermal machine operating with a quantum field, shedding light on the interplay between quantum fluctuations and thermodynamic processes. Further, we demonstrate how the DCE can be harnessed to implement a controlled-squeeze gate within a cQED platform, opening a path toward advanced quantum control and quantum information processing.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B Sriram Shastry</p>
            <p>We present a method for calculating the Yang-Lee partition function zeros of a translationally invariant model of lattice fermions, exemplified by the Hubbard model. The method rests on a theorem involving the single electron self-energy $\Sigma_\sigma(k, i \omega_n)$ in the imaginary time Matsubara formulation. The theorem maps the Yang-Lee zeros to a set of wavevector and spin labeled virtual energies $\xi_{k \sigma}$. These, thermodynamically derived virtual energies, are solutions of equations involving the self-energy at corresponding $k\sigma$'s. Examples of the method in simplified situations are provided.</p>

            <p>Triggered by the development of exfoliation and the identification of a wide range of extraordinary physical properties in self-standing films consisting of one or few atomic layers, two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and other van der Waals (vdW) crystals currently constitute a wide research field protruding in multiple directions in combination with layer stacking and twisting, nanofabrication, surface-science methods, and integration into nanostructured environments. Photonics encompasses a multidisciplinary collection of those directions, where 2D materials contribute with polaritons of unique characteristics such as strong spatial confinement, large optical-field enhancement, long lifetimes, high sensitivity to external stimuli (e.g., electric and magnetic fields, heating, and strain), a broad spectral range from the far infrared to the ultraviolet, and hybridization with spin and momentum textures of electronic band structures. The explosion of photonics with 2D materials as a vibrant research area is producing breakthroughs, including the discovery and design of new materials and metasurfaces with unprecedented properties as well as applications in integrated photonics, light emission, optical sensing, and exciting prospects for applications in quantum information, and nanoscale thermal transport. This Roadmap summarizes the state of the art in the field, identifies challenges and opportunities, and discusses future goals and how to meet them through a wide collection of topical sections prepared by leading practitioners.</p>

            <p>In this study, we investigate the problem of Anderson localization in a one-dimensional flat band lattice with a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic on-site potential. First of all, we discuss the influences of non-Hermitian potentials on the existence of critical states. Our findings show that, unlike in Hermitian cases, the non-Hermiticity of the potential leads to the disappearance of critical states and critical regions. Furthermore, we are able to accurately determine the Lyapunov exponents and the mobility edges. Our results reveal that the mobility edges form mobility lines and mobility rings in the complex energy plane. Within the mobility rings, the eigenstates are extended, while the localized states are located outside the mobility rings. For mobility line cases, only when the eigenenergies lie on the mobility lines, their corresponding eigenstates are extended this http URL, as the energy approaches the mobility edges, we observe that, differently from Hermitian cases, here the critical index of the localization length is not a constant, but rather varies depending on the positions of the mobility edges.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous interference drives oscillatory dynamics in wave-dressed active particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Austin M. Blitstein, Rodolfo R. Rosales, Pedro J. Sáenz</p>
            <p>A recent surge of discoveries has sparked significant interest in active systems where a particle moves autonomously due to a resonant interaction with its self-generated wave field, leading to notable wave-mediated effects including new propulsion mechanisms, spontaneous oscillatory dynamics, and quantum-like phenomena. Drawing from an archetypical model of wave-dressed active particles, we unveil a wave-mediated non-local force driving their dynamics, arising from the particle's path memory and an unconventional form of wave interference near jerking points, locations where the particle's velocity changes rapidly. In contrast to the typical case of constructive interference at points of stationary phase, waves excited by the particle near jerking points avoid cancellation through rapid changes in frequency. Through an asymptotic analysis, we derive the wave force from jerking points, revealing it as an elusive but crucial remnant of the particle's past motion that allows us to rationalize mechanistically in-line speed oscillations, wave-like statistics in potential wells, and non-specular reflections. The results we derive follow from generic wave superposition principles, suggesting their applicability to a broad class of wave-dressed active particles.</p>

            <h2>Tuning Charge Density Wave in the Transition from Magnetically Frustrated Conductor to Ferrimagnetic Insulator in Carbon Nanowire within Boron Nitride Nanotube</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi Ho Wong, Zong Liang Guo, King Cheong Lam, Chun Pong Chau, Wing Yu Chan, Chak-yin Tang, Yuen Hong Tsang, Leung Yuk Frank Lam, Xijun Hu</p>
            <p>The emergence of exotic charge density wave (CDW) alongside ferrimagnetism materials opens exciting new possibilities for quantum switching, particularly in field-tuning CDW electronics. However, these two phenomena often compete and rely heavily on strong electronic correlations. While carbon nanowire arrays have been experimentally shown to exhibit ferromagnetism above 400 K, our research shows that encapsulating a linear carbon chain (LCC) within zigzag boron nitride nanotubes (BNT) induces a short-range CDW state under a competing effect of ferrimagnetism and magnetic frustrations. However, for this exotic feature to occur, the LCC needs to break the symmetry along the circular plane of the BNT. Then we utilize a Monte Carlo model to identify the optimal length of LCC@BNT to tackle its size effect, while also comparing the stability of chains provided by carbon nanotubes. The shorter LCC@BNT displays a more prominent long-range CDW pattern with a tunneling barrier of 2.3 eV on the Fermi surface, transitioning into an unconventional insulator. Meanwhile, magnetic frustrations disappear, and ferrimagnetism remains stable up to 280 K. Our discovery of ferrimagnetic CDW carbyne insulators, which function without conventional periodic lattice distortion, spin-orbit coupling, or complex d and f hybridization represents a groundbreaking shift in thinking, which demonstrates that such exotic properties are not exclusive to transition metal elements. We anticipate that spin fluctuations in LCC@BNT could enable fine-tuning of the CDW pattern, and applying an electric excitation of 2.3 eV triggers an abrupt insulator-to-conductor transition for quantum switching applications.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum inference problems and quantum hidden Markov models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun Woo P. Kim, Curt von Keyserlingk, Austen Lamacraft</p>
            <p>Recently, there is interest in coincident 'sharpening' and 'learnability' transitions in monitored quantum systems. In the latter, an outside observer's ability to infer properties of a quantum system from measurements undergoes a phase transition. Such transitions appear to be related to the decodability transition in quantum error correction, but the precise connection is not clear. Here, we study these problems under one framework we call the general quantum inference problem. In cases as above where the system has a Markov structure, we say that the inference is on a quantum hidden Markov model. We show a formal connection to classical hidden Markov models and that they coincide for certain setups. For example, we prove this for those involving Haar-random unitaries and measurements. We introduce the notion of Bayes non-optimality, where parameters used for inference differs from true ones. This allows us to expand the phase diagrams of above models. At Bayes optimality, we obtain an explicit relation between 'sharpening' and 'learnability' order parameters, explicitly showing that the two transitions coincide. Next, we study concrete examples. We review quantum error correction on the toric and repetition code and their mapping to 2D random-bond Ising model (RBIM) through our framework. We study the Haar-random U(1)-symmetric monitored quantum circuit and tree, mapping each to inference models that we call the planted SSEP and planted XOR, respectively, and expanding the phase diagram to Bayes non-optimality. For the circuit, we deduce the phase boundary numerically and analytically argue that it is of a single universality class. For the tree, we present an exact solution of the entire phase boundary, which displays re-entrance as does the 2D RBIM. We discuss these phase diagrams, with their interpretations for quantum inference problems and rigorous arguments on their shapes.</p>

            <h2>How quantum fluctuations freeze a classical liquid and then melt it into a topological one</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Chen, Dan Mao, Andrea Kouta Dagnino, Glenn Wagner, Mark H. Fischer, Juraj Hasik, Eun-Ah Kim, Titus Neupert</p>
            <p>Topologically ordered quantum liquids are highly sought-after quantum phases of matter and recently, fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) joined the few experimental realizations of such phases. Here, we ask whether a gapped classical, highly degenerate liquid can be the birthplace of FCIs upon the addition of suitable quantum fluctuations. Two competing tendencies can be anticipated: (i) following the quantum order-by-disorder paradigm, quantum fluctuations could induce symmetry-breaking (charge) order, or (ii) the classical liquid builds up long-range entanglement and turns into a quantum liquid. We study spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice subject to cluster-charging interactions and introduce quantumness through a Haldane kinetic term. Based on extensive exact diagonalization calculations and high-order perturbation theory, we find that neither scenario (i) or (ii) prevails, but (i) and (ii) manifest sequentially as the kinetic energy is increased. We demonstrate how the gradual lifting of kinematic constraints gives rise to this sequence of phases. Our results relate to the regime of intermediate-scale interactions present in moiré systems, where band projections are not suitable to model FCIs and competing charge-ordered phases have been identified.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Magnon Polaritons via Eddy-Current-Induced Dissipation in Metallic-Banded YIG Spheres</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsushi Uno, Shugo Yoshii, Sotaro Mae, Ei Shigematsu, Ryo Ohshima, Yuichiro Ando, Masashi Shiraishi</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a robust method to dynamically tune magnon dissipation in yttrium iron garnet spheres by equipping a metallic band around the sphere's equator, enabling precise control over magnon-photon coupling states. The collective magnetization dynamics in the YIG sphere induce circular eddy currents in the metallic band, whose magnitude can be systematically varied by adjusting the angle between the metallic band plane and an external static magnetic field. This angular dependence yields a pronounced modulation of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth, facilitating seamless transitions between the Purcell and strong coupling regimes without altering photon cavity parameters. Systematic FMR and cavity spectroscopy measurements confirm that eddy-current-induced losses govern the primary mechanism behind the observed tunable damping. By achieving extensive periodic-angular dependence of magnon relaxation rate, we precisely control the magnon-photon coupling state, approaching the critical coupling condition. These results establish the YIG-metallic-band platform as a versatile and practical approach for engineering tunable magnon-polariton systems and advancing magnonic applications, including those exploring non-Hermitian magnonics.</p>

Multiterminal devices in the quantum regime benefit from phase-coherent phenomena, which turns the thermoelectric effect nonlocal, and from tunable single-particle interactions.

Additionally, efficient heat management devices can be defined. We review recent theoretical and experimental progress in the research of multiterminal thermal and thermoelectric quantum transport leading to proposals of autonomous quantum heat engines and thermal devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. G. M. Duarte, A. J. Chaves, N. M. R. Peres</p>
            <p>In recent years, organic materials have emerged as promising candidates for a variety of light-harvesting applications ranging from the infrared to the visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Their enhanced excitonic binding energies and large transition dipole moments enable strong coupling with light, with some systems already reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime. In contrast, a wide range of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been extensively explored in the literature, exhibiting high exciton stability and strong electron-hole coupling due to reduced screening effects. In this Letter, we present a microscopic model describing the interaction of 2D materials and organic molecular aggregates in an optical cavity. We predict the formation of a hybrid Wannier-Mott-Frenkel exciton-polariton with an enhanced Rabi splitting, exceeding that of the pure organic cavity by several tens of meV. To elucidate this phenomenon, we examine a cavity with 2D tungsten sulfide and a cyanine dye, where this enhancement corresponds to a $5\%$ increase relative to the organic cavity. The complementary characteristics of Wannier-Mott and Frenkel excitons enable the formation of tunable polariton states that merge into a single hybrid state as a function of detuning, allowing for dual Rabi splitting mechanisms. This provides a promising platform for exploring quantum optical phenomena in both the strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes.</p>

            <h2>The Universal Gap-to-Critical Temperature Ratio in Superconductors: a Statistical Mechanical Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chung-Ru Lee</p>
            <p>We propose a statistical mechanical framework to unify the observed relationship between the superconducting energy gap $\Delta$, the pseudogap $\Delta^\ast$, and the critical temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$. In this model, fermions couple as a composite boson and condense to occupy a single bound state as the temperature drops. We derive a concise formula for $T_\mathrm{c}$ in terms of $\Delta$ and $\Delta^\ast$, namely: $$\frac{\Delta}{k_\mathrm{B} T_\mathrm{c}} = 1.4+4\log(\Delta^\ast/\Delta).$$ This expression reproduces the standard BCS gap-to-$T_\mathrm{c}$ ratio in the absence of a pseudogap, while naturally explaining its enhancement in unconventional superconductors. The model is supported by comparisons with experimental data from several cuprates and iron-based superconductors, which highlight its generality. This formulation also offers a theoretical explanation for the observed persistence of the pseudogap phase into the overdoped regime.</p>

            <p>Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic materials is essential for advancing their integration into technological applications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy to control magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here, we demonstrate that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few-layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is efficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a polymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the magnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions, reaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement is accompanied by a subtle reduction of the Néel temperature by ~10K. Our experimental results are fully supported by first-principles calculations, which link the observed effects to a strain-driven modification in interlayer exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish strain engineering as a key tool for fine-tuning magnetotransport properties in 2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics and information storage devices.</p>

            <p>We report peculiar optical properties of the frustrated itinerant magnet HoAgGe, which exhibits multiple magnetically ordered states obeying the kagome spin-ice rule. The optical conductivity is surprisingly higher for light polarization perpendicular to the kagome plane, both for the free carrier response and the interband transitions. The latter ones have strong contributions from Ho $4f$ flat bands located near the Fermi level, as revealed by our \textit{ab initio} calculations, explaining the unusual anisotropy of the optical properties and the pronounced temperature dependence of the interband transitions for out--of--plane light polarization. The key role of Ho $4f$ states is further supported by the large variation of the reflectivity upon the metamagnetic transitions, that follows the field dependence of the magnetization, in contrast to that of the dc magnetotransport data. Such heavy-electron bands near the Fermi level offer an efficient way to control transport and optical properties.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit torque arising from the spin-orbit-coupled surface states of topological insulators enables current-induced control of magnetization with high efficiency. Here, alternating-current (AC) driven magnetization reversal is demonstrated in a semi-magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, facilitated by a low threshold current density of 1.5x10^9 A/m^2. Time-domain Hall voltage measurements using an oscilloscope reveal a strongly nonlinear and nonreciprocal Hall response during the magnetization reversal process. Fourier analysis of the time-varying Hall voltage identifies higher-harmonic signals and a rectified direct-current (DC) component, highlighting the complex interplay among the applied current, external magnetic field, and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, a hysteretic behavior in the current-voltage characteristics gives rise to frequency mixing under dual-frequency excitation. This effect, distinct from conventional polynomial-based nonlinearities, allows for selective extraction of specific frequency components. The results demonstrate that AC excitation can not only switch magnetization efficiently but also induce tunable nonlinear responses, offering a new pathway for multifunctional spintronic devices with potential applications in energy-efficient memory, signal processing, and frequency conversion.</p>

            <p>A twin surface dielectric barrier discharge on the microsecond scale was used in combination with a two-component coating to oxidize 300 ppm n-butane as a model volatile organic compound to CO2 and H2O in synthetic air at room temperature and at 160 °C. The integration of BaTiO3 as a base material for the coating allowed the successful use of otherwise discharge-ignition-inhibiting materials such as MnO2-CuO applied as a full coating. Application of pure BaTiO3 led to highly porous coatings that do not hinder the discharge ignition and show a negligible influence on n-butane conversion while reducing byproduct formation. Thus, BaTiO3 was identified as a suitable structure-directing agent in two-component coatings, using 1:1 and 1:2 ratios of BaTiO3:catalyst coatings. Coated electrode configurations were compared to their respective uncoated state to highlight the coating-induced changes. The two-component coatings strongly increased the CO2 selectivity, reaching a maximum of 91.6 % at an energy density of 450 J/L and 160 °C for the 1:2 ratio, corresponding to an increase of 51.0 % relative to the uncoated electrode.</p>

            <p>Cold atoms can adsorb to a surface with the emission of a single phonon when the binding energy is sufficiently small. The effects of phonon damping and adsorbent size on the adsorption rate in this quantum regime are studied using the multimode Rabi model. It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be either enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in analogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A mesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the adsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and suppresses the rate when detuned. This acoustic cavity effect occurs in the regime where the frequency spacing between vibrational modes exceeds the phonon linewidth.</p>

            <h2>Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uday S. Goteti, Robert C. Dynes</p>
            <p>Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Numerical simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems, leading to two universal laws describing the nature of information dynamics.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions lead to the production of topological defects or domain walls in a wide range of physical systems. In second-order transitions, these exhibit universal scaling laws described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, but for first-order transitions a similarly universal approach is still lacking. Here we propose a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as a testbed system where critical scaling behavior in a first-order quantum phase transition can be understood from generic properties. We demonstrate the applicability of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for this transition to determine the critical exponents for: (1) the onset of the decay of the metastable state on short times scales, and (2) the number of resulting phase-separated ferromagnetic domains at longer times, as a one-dimensional spin-1 condensate is ramped across a first-order quantum phase transition. The predictions are in excellent agreement with mean-field numerical simulations and provide a paradigm for studying the decay of metastable states in experimentally accessible systems.</p>

            <p>The Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) method is based on a linear transformation between the pseudo wavefunctions and the all electron wavefunctions. To obtain high accuracy with this method, it is important that the local part of the linear transform (inside each atomic sphere) be defined over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work and without modifying the transformation in any significant way thereby making the modifications we propose easy to implement in current electronic structure codes for PAW.. This is done by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more smooth wavefunctions (which have nothing to do with the atomic problem) and having them linearly transform via the identity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijit V. Nautiyal</p>
            <p>We theoretically explore the finite-time performance of a quantum thermochemical engine using a harmonically trapped 1D Bose gas in the quasicondensate regime as the working fluid. Operating on an Otto cycle, the engine's unitary work strokes involve quenches of interatomic interactions, treating the fluid as a closed many-body quantum system evolving dynamically from an initial thermal state. During thermalization strokes, the fluid is an open system in diffusive contact with a reservoir, enabling both heat and particle exchange. Using a c--field approach, we demonstrate that the engine operates via chemical work, driven by particle flow from the hot reservoir. The engine's performance is analyzed in two regimes: (i) the out-of-equilibrium regime, maximizing power at reduced efficiency, and (ii) the quasistatic limit, achieving maximum efficiency but zero power due to slow driving. Remarkably, chemical work enables maximum efficiency even in sudden quench regime, offering a favorable trade-off between power and efficiency. Finally, we connect this work to prior research, showing that a zero-temperature adiabatic cycle provides an upper bound for efficiency and work at finite temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Two-fluid mobility model from coupled hydrodynamic equations for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches</h2>

            <p>We introduce a two-fluid mobility model incorporating fundamental aspects of electron-hole (e-h) scattering such as momentum conservation for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches (LDSSs). Compared to previous works that use Matthiessen's rule, the two-fluid mobility model predicts distinct AC responses of e-h plasmas in semiconductors. Based on the two-fluid mobility model, we develop a theory with very few adjustable parameters for simulating the switching performance of LDSSs based on high-purity indirect-gap semiconductors such as silicon (Si). As a prototypical application, we successfully reproduce experimentally measured reflectance at around 320 GHz in a laser-driven Si switch. By injecting e-h plasmas with densities up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$, we reveal the importance of carrier-screening effects in e-h scattering and Auger recombination for carrier densities above the critical carrier density for exciton-plasma Mott transition. Our results also suggest a way to characterize the intrinsic momentum-relaxation mechanism, e-h scattering, and the intrinsic e-h recombination mechanism in indirect-gap semiconductors, Auger recombination. We reassess the ambipolar Auger coefficient of high-purity Si with high injection levels of e-h plasmas up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ and find a minimal value of $1.8\times10^{-41}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$. The value is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the ambipolar Auger coefficient widely used for simulating LDSSs, $3.8\times10^{-40}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$, which was deduced from minority-carrier lifetime in highly doped silicon more than four decades ago.</p>

            <p>We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</p>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</p>

            <h2>A Microcanonical Inflection Point Analysis via Parametric Curves and its Relation to the Zeros of the Partition Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julio Cesar Siqueira Rocha, Rodrigo Alves Dias, Bismarck Vaz da Costa</p>
            <p>In statistical physics, phase transitions are arguably among the most extensively studied phenomena. In the computational approach to this field, the development of algorithms capable of estimating entropy across the entire energy spectrum in a single execution has highlighted the efficacy of microcanonical inflection point analysis, while Fisher's zeros technique has re-emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating these phenomena. This paper presents an alternative protocol for analyzing phase transitions using a parameterization of entropy function in the microcanonical ensemble. We also provide a clear demonstration of the relation of the linear pattern of the Fisher's zeros on the complex inverse temperature map (a circle in the complex $x=e^{-\beta \varepsilon}$ map) with the order of the transition, showing that the specific heat is inversely related to the distance between the zeros. We study various model systems, including the Lennard-Jones cluster, the Ising, the XY, and the Zeeman models. By examining the behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and its derivatives in the microcanonical ensemble, we identify key features - such as loops and discontinuities in parametric curves - which signal phase transitions' presence and nature. We are confident that this approach can facilitate the classification of phase transitions across various physical systems.</p>

            <p>Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) provide a platform for probing the quantum nature of mechanical motion in mesoscopic systems. This nature manifests most profoundly when the device vibrations are nonlinear and, currently, achieving vibrational nonlinearity at the single-phonon level is an active area of pursuit in quantum information science. Despite much effort, however, this has remained elusive. Here, we report the first observation of intrinsic mesoscopic vibrational dressed states. The requisite nonlinearity results from strong resonant coupling between an eigenmode of our NEMS resonator and a single, two-level system (TLS) that is intrinsic to the device material. We control the TLS in situ by varying mechanical strain, tuning it in and out of resonance with the NEMS mode. Varying the resonant drive and/or temperature allows controlled ascent of the nonequidistant energy ladder and reveals the energy multiplets of the hybridized system. Fluctuations of the TLS on and off resonance with the mode induces switching between dressed and bare states; this elucidates the complex quantum nature of TLS-like defects in mesoscopic systems. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from the intrinsic material properties of mechanical systems - without need for complex, external quantum circuits. Our work provides long-sought insight into mesoscopic dynamics and offers a new direction to harness nanomechanics for quantum measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng Yang, Fu Xu, Da-Chuan Lu, Yi-Zhuang You, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</p>

            <p>It is known that the topological Hopf term in two-dimensional (2D) spin systems can be derived by coupling to massless Dirac fermions. We establish a universal rule governing the generation of Hopf terms in 2D quantum spin systems coupled to Dirac fermions. The key insight identifies the Hopf coefficient as the oriented volume in the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ Lie algebra space formed by Dirac cone matrix bases. This geometric interpretation allows direct determination of Hopf term without path integral computations. Applying this framework, we demonstrate nontrivial Hopf term in tailored checkerboard lattice models and recover known results in graphene-based systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Dunbrack, Pauli Virtanen, Tero T. Heikkilä</p>
            <p>Several physical phenomena in superconductors, such as helical superconductivity and the diode effect, rely on breaking time-reversal symmetry. This symmetry-breaking is usually accounted for via the Lifshitz invariant, a contribution to the free energy which is linear in the phase gradient of the order parameter. In dispersive single-band superconductors with conventional pairing, the Lifshitz invariant can be computed from the asymmetries of the spectrum near the Fermi surface. We show that in multi-band superconductors, the quantum geometry also contributes to the Lifshitz invariant, and this is the dominant contribution when the low-energy bands are flat.</p>

            <h2>Strain-induced non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wancheng Zhang, Mingkun Zheng, Yong Liu, Rui Xiong, Zhenhua Zhang, Zhihong Lu</p>
            <p>Recently, the large time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin current generated by the non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has demonstrated significant potential for spintronic applications, with both computational and experimental validations. However, considering the broad application prospects and the scarcity of conductive altermagnetic materials, the development of novel reliable methods for inducing altermagnetism is necessary. Here, strain engineering is proposed as a simple yet effective approach. This work focuses on $\mathrm{OsO}_2$--the $5d$ counterpart of $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ sharing the rutile structure--employing $ab~initio$ calculations to systematically investigate strain effects on its ASSE. We find that applying a minor equibiaxial tensile strain $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ to $\mathrm{OsO}_2$ can induce a transition from non-magnetic to altermagnetic states. Only $3\%$ $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ is required to achieve a spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim7\%$ for the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin current generated by ASSE, far exceeding the intrinsic spin Hall angle $\theta_{\text{IS}}$ produced by the conventional spin Hall effect (CSHE). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to non-relativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's non-relativistic origin. Further calculations reveal that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.</p>

            <p>Systems hosting flat bands offer a powerful platform for exploring strong correlation physics. Theoretically topological degeneracy rising in systems with non-trivial topological orders on periodic manifolds of non-zero genus can generate ideal flat bands. However, experimental realization of such geometrically engineered systems is very difficult. In this work, we demonstrate that flat planes with strategically patterned hole defects can engineer ideal flat bands. We constructing two families of models, singular flat band systems where degeneracy is stabilized by non-contractible loop excitations tied to hole defects and perfectly nested van Hove systems where degeneracy arises from line excitations in momentum space. These models circumvent the need for exotic manifolds while retaining the essential features of topological flat bands. By directly linking defect engineering to degeneracy mechanisms, our results establish a scalable framework for experimentally accessible flat band design.</p>

            <p>The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</p>

            <p>The study of quantum vortices provides critical insights into non-equilibrium dynamics across diverse physical systems. While previous research has focused on point-like vortices in two dimensions and line-like vortices in three dimensions, quantum vortices in four spatial dimensions are expected to take the form of extended vortex surfaces, thereby fundamentally enriching dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of 4D quantum vortices and turbulence. Using a special visualization method, we discovered the decay of topological numbers that does not exist in low dimensions, as well as the high-dimensional counterpart of the vortex reconnection process. We further explore quench dynamics across phase transitions in four dimensions and verify the applicability of the higher-dimensional Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our simulations provide numerical evidence of 4D quantum turbulence, characterized by universal power-law behavior. These findings reveal universal principles governing topological defects in higher dimensions, offering insights for future experimental realizations using synthetic dimensions.</p>

            <p>For a neutral system of positive and negative charges, such as atoms in a crystal, increasing the density causes the Mott transition from bound electrons to free electrons. The density of optically generated electron-hole systems can be controlled in situ by the power of optical excitation that enables the Mott transition from excitons, the bound pairs of electrons and holes, to free electrons and holes with increasing density. These Mott transitions occur in systems of pairs of the same kind, such as atoms or excitons. However, a different type of the Mott transition can occur for Bose polarons. A Bose polaron is a mobile particle of one kind in a Bose gas of particles of another kind. For the Mott transition in polarons, the polaron states vanish with increasing density of the surrounding gas. In this paper, we present the observation of this type of the Mott transition and the measurement of the Mott transition parameter $n_{\rm M}^{1/2} a_{\rm B}$ in 2D excitonic Bose polarons.</p>

Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the extended, critical, and localized states can be effectively distinguished via their phase space representation, specially the Wigner distribution. Based on the Wigner distribution function, we can further obtain the corresponding Wigner entropy and employ the feature that the critical state has the maximum Wigner entropy to locate the invariable mobility edge.

            <p>Altermagnetism is a collinear magnetic order in which opposite spin species are exchanged under a real-space rotation. Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group symmetry. This form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.</p>

The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states. Our experiments are made possible by extensively utilizing one of the highest-fidelity quantum processors currently available and, thus, should be considered as a benchmark for the current status of the most advanced quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $\Theta(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.</p>

            <p>The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Fitting oscillator models to variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) data can lead to non-unique, unphysical results. We demonstrate using temperature-dependent trends to prevent overfitting and ensure model physicality. As a case study, we performed mid-infrared VASE measurements on fused silica (SiO2) of various grades, from room temperature to 600 °C. We fitted oscillator models independently at each temperature, and confirmed the model's physical validity by observing the expected monotonic trends in vibrational oscillator parameters. Using this technique, we generated a highly accurate dataset for the temperature-dependent complex refractive index of fused silica for modeling mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics and DC conductivity of 2D anisotropic fluids from axion holography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alfonso Ballon-Bayona, Jonathan P. Shock, Dimitrios Zoakos</p>
            <p>We investigate a strongly coupled finite-density anisotropic fluid in $2+1$ dimensions dual to an asymptotically AdS black brane that is a solution of Einstein-Maxwell-Axion theory in $3+1$ dimensions. Despite the anisotropy, the fluid thermodynamic properties align with those of a conformal fluid. Moreover, we show that the fluid is stable under the increase of the anisotropy parameter. Additionally, we analyse the DC conductivity of the anisotropic fluid, showing its compatibility with momentum dissipation due to translational symmetry breaking. In the limit of very large anisotropy we find that the DC conductivity vanishes as a consequence of dimensionality reduction. We also find that a metal-insulator transition arises driven by the anisotropy.</p>

            <h2>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiaofeng Liu, Ian Low, Zhewei Yin</p>
            <p>Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</p>

            <p>The utility of near-term quantum computers for simulating realistic quantum systems hinges on the stability of digital quantum matter--realized when discrete quantum gates approximate continuous time evolution--and whether it can be maintained at system sizes and time scales inaccessible to classical simulations. Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.</p>

            <h2>How does the entanglement entropy of a many-body quantum system change after a single measurement?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Fan, Can Yin, Antonio M. García-García</p>
            <p>For one-dimensional free Dirac fermions, we compute numerically the probability distribution of the change in the entanglement entropy (EE), after the saturation time, resulting from a single measurement of the occupation number by using different measurement protocols. For the quantum jump and the projective measurement protocols, we observe clear deviations from Gaussianity characterized by broader and asymmetric tails, exponential for positive values of the change, and a peak at zero that increases with the system size and the monitoring strength supporting that in all cases the EE is in the area law phase. Another distinct feature of the distribution is its spatial inhomogeneity. In the weak monitoring limit, the distribution is close to Gaussian with a broad support for boundary point separating the two subsystems defining the EE while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails and a much narrower support. For a quantum state diffusion protocol, the distribution is Gaussian for weak monitoring. As the monitoring strength increases, it gradually develops symmetric exponential tails. In the strong monitoring limit, the tails are still exponential but the core turns from Gaussian to strongly peaked at zero suggesting the dominance of quantum Zeno effect. For all monitoring strengths, the distribution is size independent.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers</h2>

            <p>Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</p>

            <p>To understand the properties and interactions of materials, and determining the ground state energies is one of the important challenges in quantum chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics, where quantum computing can play an important role for studying the properties of materials. In this study, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the He molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raul Perea-Causin, Hui Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz</p>
            <p>Moiré materials have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. While recent experiments have unveiled fractional Chern insulators exhibiting the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect based on electrons or holes, the exploration of analogous many-body states with bosonic constituents remains largely uncharted. In this work, we predict the emergence of bosonic fractional Chern insulators arising from long-lived excitons in a moiré superlattice formed by twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ stacked on monolayer MoSe$_2$. Performing exact diagonalization on the exciton flat Chern band present in this structure, we establish the existence of Abelian and non-Abelian phases at band filling $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$, respectively, through multiple robust signatures including ground-state degeneracy, spectral flow, many-body Chern number, and particle-cut entanglement spectrum. The obtained energy gap of $\sim 10$ meV for the Abelian states suggests a remarkably high stability of this phase. Our findings not only introduce a highly tunable and experimentally accessible platform for investigating bosonic fractional Chern insulators but also open a new pathway for realizing non-Abelian anyons.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric materials like NbOI$_{2}$ have garnered significant interest, yet their temporal response and synergetic interaction with light remain underexplored. Previous studies on the polarization of oxide ferroelectrics have relied on time-resolved optical second harmonic generation or ultrafast X-ray scattering. Here, we probe the laser-induced polarization dynamics of 2D NbOI$_{2}$ nanocrystals using ultrafast transmission electron diffraction and deflectometry. The deflection of the electron pulses is directly sensitive to the changes in the polarization, while the diffraction signal captures the structural evolution. Excited with a UV laser pulse, the polarization of NbOI$_{2}$ is initially suppressed for two picoseconds, then it recovers and overshoots, leading to a transiently enhanced polarization persisting for over 200 ps. This recovery coincides with coherent acoustic phonon generation, triggering a piezoresponse in the NbOI$_{2}$ nanocrystals. Our results offer a new method for sensing the ferroelectric order parameter in femtosecond time scales.</p>

            <h2>Spin Qubit Properties of the Boron-Vacancy/Carbon Defect in the Two-Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergey Stolbov, Marisol Alcántara Ortigoza</p>
            <p>Spin qubit defects in two-dimensional materials have a number of advantages over those in three-dimensional hosts including simpler technologies for the defect creation and control, as well as qubit accessibility. In this work, we select the VBCB defect in the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a possible optically controllable spin qubit and explain its triplet ground state and neutrality. In this defect a boron vacancy is combined with a carbon dopant substituting the closest boron atom to the vacancy. Our density-functional-theory calculations confirmed that the system has dynamically stable spin triplet and singlet ground states. As revealed from our linear response GW calculations, the spin-sensitive electronic states are localized around the three undercoordinated N atoms and make local peaks in the density of electronic states within the bandgap. Using the triplet and singlet ground state energies, as well as the energies of the optically excited states, obtained from solution to the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we construct the spin-polarization cycle, which is found to be favorable for the spin qubit initialization. The calculated zero-field splitting parameters ensure that the splitting energy between the spin projections in the triplet ground state is comparable to that of the known spin qubits. We thus propose the VBCB defect in hBN as a promising spin qubit.</p>

            <p>Realizing semiconductors with high symmetry of their crystallographic structures has been a virtue of inorganic materials and has resulted in novel physical behaviors. In contrast, hybrid (organic and inorganic) crystals such as two-dimensional metal halide perovskites exhibit much lower crystal symmetry due to in-plane or out of plane octahedral distortions. Despite their amazing ability for photoinduced light emission at room temperature, the Achilles' heel of this attractive class of 2D materials for optoelectronics remains the poor control and lack of performance for charge carrier transport. Inspired by the tremendous charge carrier properties of the 3D cubic perovskite phase of FAPbI3 and combining the use of the appropriate cage cation, the spacer molecule and the temperature and rate of crystallization, we report a new series of FA-based layered two-dimensional perovskites that exhibits the highest theoretically predicted symmetry with a tetragonal P4/mmm space group, resulting in no octahedral distortion in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These 2D perovskites present the shortest interlayer distances (4 angstrom), which results in systematically lower bandgaps (1.7 to 1.8 eV). Finally, the absence of octahedral distortions, results in an exciton diffusion length of 2.5 {\mu}m, and a diffusivity of 4.4 cm2s-1, both of which are an order of magnitude larger compared to previously reported 2D perovskites and on par with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p>Controlling spin orientation of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, resulting in the discovery of various phases of matter. However, in most cases, spin orientation can be stablished only at specific directions of out-of-plane and in-plane, which is a drawback compared with three-dimensional systems, limiting exploration of novel physics. Here, we introduce a methodology for manipulating spin slanting in 2D multiferroic materials through ultrafast pulses of light. Based on model analysis, we find that simultaneous triggering spin-orbit coupling induced interactions from in-plane and out-of-plane orbitals can generate spin slanting. By choosing 2D multiferroic materials with specific low-energy composition endowed by symmetry, such triggering can be readily achieved through ultrafast light illumination, leading to light-induced spin slanting. Using real-time time-dependent density-functional theory, we demonstrate this approach in multiferroic single-layer CuCr2Se4. This study provides an efficient way to manipulate spin orientation in 2D materials and establishes a general platform to explore physics and applications associated with spin slanting.</p>

            <h2>Contrasting Light-Induced Spin Torque in Antiferromagnetic and Altermagnetic Systems</h2>

            <p>Light-matter interaction has become one of the promising routes to manipulating various physical feature of quantum materials in an ultrafast kinetics. In this work, we focus on the nonlinear optical effects of the spintronic behavior in antiferromagnetic (AFM) and altermagnetic (AM) systems with compensated magnetic moments, which has been extensively attractive for their potential applications. With vanishing net magnetic moments, one of the main concerns is how to distinguish and disentangle AFMs and AMs in experiments, as they usually behave similarly in many susceptibility measurements. To address this challenge, we propose that linearly polarized light could trigger contrasting nonequilibrium local spin torques in these systems, unravelling hidden light-induced spintronic behaviors. In general, one could achieve light-induced spin canting in AMs, while only Neel vector torques in AFMs. We scrutinize and enumerate their symmetry constraints of all 122 magnetic point groups. We also adopt low energy Hamiltonian models and first-principles calculations on two representative materials to illustrate our theory. Our work provides a new perspective for the design and optimization of spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Gerard R. Sevilla, Jayson G. Cosme</p>
            <p>The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, matter-wave superradiance, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave (DW) phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities, which may hint at an eventual transition to a Mott insulating (MI) phase.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets are a new class of materials, which are promising for spintronics applications, but the experimental proof of a finite sublattice magnetisation is often difficult. Here it is shown that in altermagnets, there exists a large magnetic circular dichroism (CD) in the resonant photoelectron diffraction (RPED) pattern. RPED calculations are performed for MnTe at the Mn L$_{2,3}$-edge resonance, using a combination of atomic multiplet and multiple scattering theory. A large CD of purely magnetic origin is found for light helicity parallel to the Néel vector. The magnetic CD has the same angular distribution as the difference between the structural RPED of the two magnetic sublattices and its amplitude is approximately proportional to the magnetic CD in X-ray absorption of a single sublattice. This shows that RPED-CD provides a direct experimental probe of the staggered magnetization.</p>

The bright mode exhibits both magnon and photon blockade due to a weak effective nonlinearity, while the dark mode only exhibits magnon blockade for a detuned cavity photon. The blockade efficiency can further be optimized by appropriately tuning the competing interactions in the system. In addition, we show that applying a DC magnetic field, which lifts the degeneracy of antiferromagnetic chiral magnon eigenmodes, destroys the dark mode and leads to an unconventional photon blockade. These findings provide a pathway for generating single magnon and photon states useful for quantum information technology based on the underlying large squeezing of antiferromagnetic magnons.</p>

Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group this http URL form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable.

            <p>Rare-earth-based triangular lattice antiferromagnets, with strong quantum fluctuations and weak magnetic interactions, can often retain large magnetic entropy down to very low temperatures, making them excellent candidates for magnetic refrigeration at ultra-low temperatures. These materials exhibit a substantial magnetocaloric effect (MCE) due to enhanced spin fluctuations, particularly near quantum critical points, which leads to significant changes in magnetic entropy. This study reports on the crystal growth, structure, magnetism, and MCE of a Gd-based triangular lattice material, GdBO3, characterized by a large spin quantum number (S = 7/2). Successive phase transitions (T1 = 0.52 K, T2 = 0.88 K, and T3 = 1.77 K) were observed in zero-field specific heat measurements. Furthermore, thermal dynamic analysis under external magnetic fields identified five distinct phase regions and three quantum critical points for GdBO3. Due to its broad specific heat features and the high density of magnetic Gd3+ ions, we achieved a minimum temperature of 50 mK near the field-induced quantum critical point, using a custom-designed GdBO3-based adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator. Our findings reveal significant quantum fluctuations below 2 K, demonstrating GdBO3's potential for milli-Kelvin magnetic cooling applications.</p>

Here, we investigate the formation of time-reversal symmetric bands by hybridizing multiple such states and analyzing their electronic topological properties. The low-energy theory shows that competing emerging singlet and triplet superconducting pairings drive the formation of topologically non-trivial phases in symmetry class DIII. Therefore, Kramers pairs of Majorana zero modes appear at the ends of Machida-Shibata chains, while two-dimensional lattices host helical Majorana edge modes. Additionally, we discover extended regions in the Brillouin zone with vanishing superconducting pairings, which can be lifted by repulsive electron interactions. Our findings offer new perspectives for manipulating topological superconductivity and pairings in non-magnetic adatom systems.</p>

            <p>The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagomé bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system.

            <p>We experimentally investigate the dynamics of exciton polariton Josephson junctions when the coupling between condensates is periodically modulated through self-induced mechanical oscillations. The condensates energy detuning, the analog of the bias voltage in superconducting junctions, displays a plateau behavior akin to the Shapiro steps. At each step massive tunneling of particles occurs featuring Shapiro-like spikes. These characteristic changes are observed when the condensates Josephson frequency $\omega_\textrm{J}$ is an integer multiple of the modulation frequency $\omega_\mathrm{M}$.</p>

            <h2>Emergent phases in the Yao-Lee model via coupling to topological spin textures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Akram, Onur Erten</p>
            <p>Electrons in metals experience an effective vector potential when coupled to spin textures with non-zero scalar spin chirality, such as skyrmions. This coupling can generate a substantial field, leading to pronounced observable phenomena, including the topological Hall effect. Motivated by this, we consider a bilayer model in which the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee model on one layer interact with topological spin textures on the second layer via a spin-spin interaction. Unlike the Kitaev model, the Yao-Lee model remains exactly solvable, allowing us to perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine its ground state. Our analysis indicates that skyrmion crystals can give rise to a variety of vison crystals that are periodic arrangements of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes with unusual patterns such as a kagome pattern. In addition, Majorana fermions acquire a substantial Berry phase from skyrmion crystals, resulting in phases with finite Chern numbers up to $\nu =5$. In the case of a single skyrmion defect in the magnetic layer, a corresponding defect in the vison configuration can be realized. These defects support localized states when the spin liquid is gapped. Similar to skyrmion crystals, spiral spin textures also give rise to a diverse range of flux crystals. However, in this case, most of these phases are gapless, with only a few being trivially-gapped. Our results highlight the rich physics emerging from the interplay between topological spin textures and fractionalized quasiparticles in quantum spin liquids.</p>

            <h2>Non-Haar random circuits form unitary designs as fast as Haar random circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toshihiro Yada, Ryotaro Suzuki, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Nobuyuki Yoshioka</p>
            <p>The unitary design formation in random circuits has attracted considerable attention due to its wide range of practical applications and relevance to fundamental physics. While the formation rates in Haar random circuits have been extensively studied in previous works, it remains an open question how these rates are affected by the choice of local randomizers. In this work, we prove that the circuit depths required for general non-Haar random circuits to form unitary designs are upper bounded by those for the corresponding Haar random circuits, up to a constant factor independent of the system size. This result is derived in a broad range of circuit structures, including one- and higher-dimensional lattices, geometrically non-local configurations, and even extremely shallow circuits with patchwork architectures. We provide specific applications of these results in randomized benchmarking and random circuit sampling, and also discuss their implications for quantum many-body physics. Our work lays the foundation for flexible and robust randomness generation in real-world experiments, and offers new insights into chaotic dynamics in complex quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Adiabatic optimal control schemes are essential for advancing the practical implementation of quantum technologies. However, the vast array of possible adiabatic protocols, combined with their dependence on the particular quantum system and function-specific parameter ranges, complicates the task of discerning their respective strengths and limitations in arbitrary operations. In this work, we provide a unifying framework, called $(\alpha,\beta)$-hypergeometries, that allows for flexible, noise-resistant, and easy-to-use implementation of enforced adiabatic dynamics for any multi-level quantum system. Moreover, this framework provides a comprehensive mapping of all adiabatic protocols through a universal cost function and offers an exact analytical characterization of the adiabatic dynamics. In particular, we derive precise expressions for infidelity resonances and establish performance guarantees in the adiabatic limit for any choice of $(\alpha,\beta)$. We also discuss in detail the experimental feasibility of the resulting pulse shapes through analytical and numerical methods. Finally, we test our method for the optimal control of coherent information transfer through spin shuttling in silicon quantum dots with small valley splittings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago V. Fernandes, Francisco J. Gandum, José P. S. Lemos</p>
            <p>We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.</p>

            <p>Surface plasmons or phonons propagating on a two-dimensional (2D) material can exhibit coupling with resonant excitations in its substrate, and the resulting coupled modes were extensively studied. Similar coupling of edge modes propagating along a boundary of 2D material with the substrate excitations remains unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the edge-substrate hybrid modes using the exact Wiener-Hopf analytical approach. We analyze dispersions, decay rate, and confinement of such hybrid modes both without magnetic field (plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon hybrid modes) and in quantizing magnetic field where edge magnetoplasmons hybridize with substrate phonons. The hybrid modes are predicted to occur in THz and far-IR ranges for several combinations of quasi-2D materials (single- and bilayer graphene, quantum wells, thin-film semiconductors) and substrates with polar-phonon resonances.</p>

            <p>Atomistic materials modeling is a critical task with wide-ranging applications, from drug discovery to materials science, where accurate predictions of the target material property can lead to significant advancements in scientific discovery. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent the state-of-the-art approach for modeling atomistic material data thanks to their capacity to capture complex relational structures. While machine learning performance has historically improved with larger models and datasets, GNNs for atomistic materials modeling remain relatively small compared to large language models (LLMs), which leverage billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets to achieve remarkable performance in their respective domains. To address this gap, we explore the scaling limits of GNNs for atomistic materials modeling by developing a foundational model with billions of parameters, trained on extensive datasets in terabyte-scale. Our approach incorporates techniques from LLM libraries to efficiently manage large-scale data and models, enabling both effective training and deployment of these large-scale GNN models. This work addresses three fundamental questions in scaling GNNs: the potential for scaling GNN model architectures, the effect of dataset size on model accuracy, and the applicability of LLM-inspired techniques to GNN architectures. Specifically, the outcomes of this study include (1) insights into the scaling laws for GNNs, highlighting the relationship between model size, dataset volume, and accuracy, (2) a foundational GNN model optimized for atomistic materials modeling, and (3) a GNN codebase enhanced with advanced LLM-based training techniques. Our findings lay the groundwork for large-scale GNNs with billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets, establishing a scalable pathway for future advancements in atomistic materials modeling.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Luminous Transmission and Solar Modulation in Thermochromic VO2 Aerogel-Like Films via Remote Plasma Deposition</h2>

            <p>Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a thermochromic material that undergoes a phase transition from a monoclinic semiconducting state to a rutile metallic state at 68 degrees C, a temperature close to room temperature. This property makes VO2 particularly valuable in applications such as optical and electrical switches, data storage, neuromorphic computing, and remarkably dynamic smart windows for solar radiation control. VO2 typically needs to be synthesized for these applications as nanostructured thin films. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have been made to control the thermochromic properties of VO2 through crystal structure tuning, doping, and the development of VO2 nanocomposites. Additionally, introducing nano- and mesoporosity has been shown to enhance the optical properties of thermochromic VO2 films. This study presents a methodology for producing highly porous, aerogel-like V2O5 films, which can be thermally processed to form aerogel-like VO2 films. This process is based on sequential plasma polymerization and plasma etching to produce aerogel-like V2O5 films that are annealed to yield ultraporous nanocrystalline VO2 films. The sacrificial vanadium-containing plasma polymers are obtained by remote plasma-assisted vacuum deposition (RPAVD) using vanadyl porphyrin as a precursor and Ar as plasma gas. The aerogel-like VO2 films show exceptional thermochromic performance with luminous transmittances higher than 54%, solar modulation up to 18.8%, and IR modulation up to 35.5%. The presented plasma methodology is versatile, allowing both the synthesis of VO2 plasmonic structures to enhance the thermochromic response and the encapsulation of films to improve their stability in air dramatically. Additionally, this solvent-free synthetic method is fully compatible with doping procedures, scalable, and holds great potential for designing and optimizing smart window coatings.</p>

            <h2>Replica manifolds, pole skipping, and the butterfly effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wan Zhen Chua, Thomas Hartman, Wayne W. Weng</p>
            <p>The black hole butterfly effect is a signal of quantum chaos in holographic theories that can be probed in different ways, including out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), pole skipping (PS), and entanglement wedge (EW) reconstruction. Each of these three phenomena can be used to define a butterfly velocity that measures the speed at which chaos spreads. In a general quantum system the three velocities $v_B^{\text{OTOC}}$, $v_B^{\text{PS}}$, and $v_B^{\text{EW}}$ can be different, but it is known from explicit calculations that they are all equal in certain holographic theories dual to Einstein gravity plus higher-curvature corrections. A conceptual explanation for this apparent coincidence is lacking. We show that it follows from a deeper relationship: The pole-skipping mode, added to the black hole background, can be reinterpreted as the gravitational replica manifold for the late-time entanglement wedge, and its imaginary part is the shockwave that computes the OTOC. Thus pole skipping is directly related to entanglement dynamics in holographic theories, and the origin of the pole-skipping mode is an extremal surface on the horizon. This explains the coincidence $v_B^{\text{OTOC}} = v_B^{\text{PS}} = v_B^{\text{EW}}$ in known cases, and extends it to general theories of gravity with a pole-skipping mode having the usual behavior.</p>

            <h2>Nonadiabatic Field: A Conceptually Novel Approach for Nonadiabatic Quantum Molecular Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baihua Wu, Bingqi Li, Xin He, Xiangsong Cheng, Jiajun Ren, Jian Liu</p>
            <p>Reliable trajectory-based nonadiabatic quantum dynamics methods at the atomic level are critical for understanding many important processes in real systems. The paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually novel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories. Substantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and surface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic force arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic states, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic electronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between electronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the relevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is derived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with coordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed for discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient integrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic representations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF can in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the time correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are applied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark models where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is shown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of the electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable simulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear dynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides simultaneous measurement of homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths through quantitative lineshape analysis. However, conventional lineshape analysis methods assume Gaussian inhomogeneity, limiting its applicability to systems with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity.

An algorithm is developed to extract the homogeneous linewidth and arbitrary inhomogeneous distribution from experimentally-measured 2D spectrum. We demonstrate this framework for the excitonic resonance in a GaAs quantum well with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. This work broadens the scope of quantitative lineshape analysis for studying materials with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity.</p>

            <h2>Manifestation of critical effects in environmental parameter estimation using a quantum sensor under dynamical control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Cristina Rodriguez, Analia Zwick, Gonzalo A. Alvarez</p>
            <p>Quantum probes offer a powerful platform for exploring environmental dynamics, particularly through their sensitivity to decoherence processes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of critical behavior in the estimation of the environmental memory time $\tau_c$, modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process characterized by a Lorentzian spectral density. Using dynamically controlled qubit-based sensors -- realized experimentally via solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and supported by numerical simulations -- we implement tailored filter functions to interrogate the environmental noise spectrum and extract $\tau_c$ from its spectral width. Our results reveal a sharp transition in estimation performance between short-memory (SM) and long-memory (LM) regimes, reflected in a non-monotonic estimation error that resembles a phase transition. This behavior is accompanied by an avoided-crossing-like structure in the estimated parameter space, indicative of two competing solutions near the critical point. These features underscore the interplay between control, decoherence, and inference in open quantum systems. Beyond their fundamental significance, these critical phenomena offer a practical diagnostic tool for identifying dynamical regimes and optimizing quantum sensing protocols. By exploiting this criticality, our findings pave the way for adaptive control strategies aimed at enhancing precision in quantum parameter estimation -- particularly in complex or structured environments such as spin networks, diffusive media, and quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Boundary Scattering and Non-invertible Symmetries in 1+1 Dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soichiro Shimamori, Satoshi Yamaguchi</p>
            <p>Recent studies by Copetti, Córdova and Komatsu have revealed that when non-invertible symmetries are spontaneously broken, the conventional crossing relation of the S-matrix is modified by the effects of the corresponding topological quantum field theory (TQFT). In this paper, we extend these considerations to $(1+1)$-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries. In the presence of a boundary, one can define not only the bulk S-matrix but also the boundary S-matrix, which is subject to a consistency condition known as the boundary crossing relation. We show that when the boundary is weakly-symmetric under the non-invertible symmetry, the conventional boundary crossing relation also receives a modification due to the TQFT effects. As a concrete example of the boundary scattering, we analyze kink scattering in the gapped theory obtained from the $\Phi_{(1,3)}$-deformation of a minimal model. We explicitly construct the boundary S-matrix that satisfies the Ward-Takahashi identities associated with non-invertible symmetries.</p>

            <p>Sensing and discriminating between enantiomers of chiral molecules remains a significant challenge in the design of sensor platforms. In the case of chemoresistive sensors, where detection relies on changes in electrical response upon analyte adsorption, the sensor substrate is typically functionalized with chirality sensitive molecular receptors. In this computational study, we investigate whether a chirality-blind substrate, such as a graphene nanoribbon, is still capable of discriminating between enantiomers. To this end, we employ a density-functional parametrized tight-binding method combined with nonequilibrium Green functions. For a small set of chiral amino acids, we demonstrate that accounting for the nonequilibrium response of the device leads to significant differences in the electrical currents of enantiomeric pairs of the order tens of nanoamperes. This effect is further amplified when structural fluctuations of the device's active region are considered (1-2 microAmp). Moreover, we propose new quantum-mechanical quantities for enantioselective discrimination in molecular sensors, with an emphasis on binding features and property-property correlations. Therefore, our work demonstrates the significance of nonequilibrium effects in chiral discrimination, laying the foundation for future investigations addressing the design of chiral molecular sensors.</p>

            <p>A relevant problem in statistics is defining the correlation of two rankings of a list of items. Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are two well established correlation coefficients, characterized by a symmetric form that ensures zero expected value between two pairs of rankings randomly chosen with uniform probability. However, in recent years, several weighted versions of the original Spearman and Kendall coefficients have emerged that take into account the greater importance of top ranks compared to low ranks, which is common in many contexts. The weighting schemes break the symmetry, causing a non-zero expected value between two random rankings. This issue is very relevant, as it undermines the concept of uncorrelation between rankings. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a standardization function $g(x)$ that maps a correlation ranking coefficient $\Gamma$ in a standard form $g(\Gamma)$ that has zero expected value, while maintaining the relevant statistical properties of $\Gamma$.</p>

            <p>Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. We consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated with harsh and mild environmental conditions. When the rate of switching is neither too slow nor too fast, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks and the population is prone to fluctuations or extinction. We analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak, and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to what happens in static environments, the fixation probability depends on the migration rate. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</p>

            <p>Intracellular phagosomes have a lipid bilayer encapsulated fluidic shell outside the particle, on the outer side of which, molecular motors are attached. An optically trapped spherical birefringent particle phagosome provides an ideal platform to probe fluidity of the shell, as the inner particle is optically confined both in translation and in rotation. Using a recently reported method to calibrate the translation and pitch rotations - yielding a spatial resolution of about 2 nm and angular resolution of 0.1 degrees - we report novel roto-translational coupled dynamics. We also suggest a new technique where we explore the correlation between the translation and pitch rotation to study extent of activity. Given that a spherical birefringent particle phagosome is almost a sphere, the fact that it turns due to the activity of the motors is not obvious, even implying high rigidity of shell. Applying a minimal model for the roto-translational coupling, we further show that this coupling manifests itself as sustained fluxes in phase space, a signature of broken detailed balance.</p>

            <p>Not only is the geometry of rock fragments often well approximated by ideal convex polyhedra having few faces and vertices, but these numbers carry vital geophysical information on the fragmentation process. Despite their significance, the identification of the ideal polyhedron has so far been carried out through visual inspection. Here, we present an algorithm capable of performing this task in a reliable manner. The input is a 3D scan of the fragment which is essentially a triangulated polyhedron, which however has often large number of faces and vertices. Our algorithm performs a systematic simplification using the following steps: - Gaussian smoothing is performed on the spherical histogram of the 3D scans faces to identify the most important face orientations. - Planes carrying the faces of the ideal polyhedron are identified as maxima of the smoothed histogram - Polygon is reconstructed using the identified planes - Small faces are removed in a systematic manner We present two versions of the algorithm that we benchmarked the algorithm against a dataset of human measurements on 132 fragments. Beyond identifying the ideal polyhedral approximation for fragments, our method is also capable of tracing backward the shape evolution of rounded pebbles to their origins.</p>

The birefringence results indicate a transition temperature, where the crystal transforms from an anisotropic to isotropic property, and the advance of MgO doping in the crystal, which is related to the optical damage threshold of the materials. In addition, the lattice dynamics of the crystals have been analyzed by revisiting the Raman spectroscopy.

            <p>Ising machines show promise as ultrafast hardware for optimizations encoded in Ising Hamiltonians but fall short in terms of success rate and performance scaling. Here, we propose a novel Ising machine that exploits the three-dimensional nature of nonlinear polarization oscillators to counteract these limitations. Based on the evolution of the optical polarization in third-order nonlinear media, the high-dimensional machine reaches the Ising ground state by the mechanism of dimensional collapse: the dynamics on the Poincaré sphere undergoes a self-induced collapse into polarization fixed points mapping Ising spins. The photonic setup consists of polarization-modulated pulses in a $\chi^{(3)}$ crystal subject to iterative feedback. We numerically demonstrate that its high-dimensional operation leads to an enhanced success probability on benchmark graphs and an exponential improvement in performance scaling with respect to coherent Ising machines. The proposed polarization Ising machine paves the way for a new class of Ising solvers with enhanced computing capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Autophoretic skating along permeable surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Günther Turk, Rajesh Singh, Howard A. Stone</p>
            <p>The dynamics of self-propelled colloidal particles are strongly influenced by their environment through hydrodynamic and, in many cases, chemical interactions. We develop a theoretical framework to describe the motion of confined active particles by combining the Lorentz reciprocal theorem with a Galerkin discretisation of surface fields, yielding an equation of motion that efficiently captures self-propulsion without requiring an explicit solution for the bulk fluid flow. Applying this framework, we identify and characterise the long-time behaviours of a Janus particle near rigid, permeable, and fluid-fluid interfaces, revealing distinct motility regimes, including surface-bound skating, stable hovering, and chemo-hydrodynamic reflection. Our results demonstrate how the solute permeability and the viscosity contrast of the surface influence a particle's dynamics, providing valuable insights into experimentally relevant guidance mechanisms for autophoretic particles. The computational efficiency of our method makes it particularly well-suited for systematic parameter sweeps, offering a powerful tool for mapping the phase space of confined active particles and informing high-fidelity numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>The cell-centered Finite-Volume self-consistent approach for heterostructures: 1D electron gas at the Si-SiO2 interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vahid Mosallanejad, Haiou Li, Gang Cao, Kuei-Lin Chiu, Wenjie Dou, Guo-ping Guo</p>
            <p>Achieving self-consistent convergence with the conventional effective-mass approach at ultra-low temperatures (below $4.2~K$) is a challenging task, which mostly lies in the discontinuities in material properties (e.g., effective-mass, electron affinity, dielectric constant). In this article, we develop a novel self-consistent approach based on cell-centered Finite-Volume discretization of the Sturm-Liouville form of the effective-mass Schr{ö}dinger equation and generalized Poisson's equation (FV-SP). We apply this approach to simulate the one-dimensional electron gas (1DEG) formed at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface via a top gate. We find excellent self-consistent convergence from high to extremely low (as low as $50~mK$) temperatures. We further examine the solidity of FV-SP method by changing external variables such as the electrochemical potential and the accumulative top gate voltage. Our approach allows for counting electron-electron interactions. Our results demonstrate that FV-SP approach is a powerful tool to solve effective-mass Hamiltonians.</p>

            <h2>Effect of substrate spin-orbit coupling on the topological gap size of Shiba chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Beck, Lucas Schneider, Roland Wiesendanger, Jens Wiebe</p>
            <p>Realizing Majorana bound states in chains of magnetic impurities on $s$-wave superconducting substrates relies on a fine tuning of the energy and hybridization of the single magnetic impurity bound states and of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). While recent experiments investigate the influence of the former two parameters, the effect of SOC remained experimentally largely unexplored. Here, we present a scanning tunneling spectroscopy study of close-packed Mn chains along the [001]-direction on Ta(110) which has almost identical atomic and surface electronic structure compared to the previously studied Nb(110) system, but a three times larger SOC. The dominant Shiba band has a very similar dispersion, but its minigap, taken relative to $\varDelta$, is increased by a factor of 1.9 with respect to the Nb case, which can be ascribed to the stronger SOC.</p>

            <p>Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially-generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data is available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our simple hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation-integration transition even with memory-less agents. This suggests an explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood's population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract genomic spaces.</p>

            <h2>Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Ghosh, Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups, which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $ \mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin, and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1) change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on $\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.</p>

            <h2>Nanoscale Casimir Force Softening Originated from Quantum Surface Responses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hewan Zhang, Kun Ding</p>
            <p>Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included. Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.</p>

            <p>We consider quantum spin chains with a hidden free fermionic structure, distinct from the Jordan-Wigner transformation and its generalizations. We express selected local operators with the hidden fermions. This way we can exactly solve the real time dynamics in various physical scenarios, including the computation of selected dynamical two point functions, in continuous or discrete time. In the latter case we build a quantum circuit that can be implemented on a quantum computer. With this we extend the family of classically simulable quantum many-body processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe E. F. de Andrade, L. N. Jorge, Claudio J. DaSilva</p>
            <p>In this paper, we thoroughly examined the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in the two-dimensional XY model on the honeycomb lattice. To address its thermodynamical behavior, we combined standard numerical Monte Carlo simulations with the simulated annealing (SA) protocol and entropic simulations based on the Wang-Landau (WL) algorithm. The transition temperature was determined using the second ($\Upsilon$) and fourth-order ($\Upsilon_4$) helicity modulus as the order parameter. Our best finite-size scaling analysis suggests $T_{BKT} = 0.575(8)$ from SA and $T_{BKT}=0.576(3)$ from WL. These values deviate significantly from the expected theoretical value of $1/\sqrt{2}$. We believe that this discrepancy suggests that the theoretical assumptions regarding the analytical calculation may need to be revisited. Additionally, we calculated the vortex density and the formation energy of the vortex-antivortex pairs, where the obtained vortex formation energy is $2\mu=5.80(12)$. Upon comparison with the square lattice, our results support the notion of instability of the honeycomb lattice to support the spin long-range order and give additional backing to the critical behavior we found.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Xu, Gui-Xin Liu, Yi-Fan Jiang</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground-state properties of the Hubbard model on wide diagonal square cylinders, rotated by $\pi/4$ relative to the regular lattice orientation. Using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations with a large number of states, we convincingly demonstrate the development of a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) characterized by infinite-length stripes along the primitive vector of square lattice in models with next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'=-0.1\sim -0.3$ and doping $\delta \sim 14\%$. Intriguingly, analysis of pair-pair correlation functions along these stripes reveals incommensurate pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity with diverged susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical evidence of dominant PDW in the single-band Hubbard model on square lattices. At lower doping $\delta \sim 10\%$, we observed the formation of an additional CDW order within each stripe, which aligns across different stripes, forming a holon Wigner crystal phase. The spin pattern retains antiferromagnetic stripes with anti-phase domain walls. The ordering momentum of this emerged CDW order is remarkably close to the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs in the PDW phase, suggesting a multifaceted relationship between CDW and PDW ordering.</p>

            <p>Metals are commonly used as electrostatic gates in devices due to their abundant charge carrier densities that are necessary for efficient charging and discharging. A semiconducting gate can be beneficial for certain fabrication processes, in low light conditions, and for specific gating properties. We determine the effectiveness and limitations of a semiconducting gate in graphene and bilayer graphene devices. Using the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), tungsten disulfide (WS2), and tungsten diselenide (WSe2), we show that two-dimensional semiconductors can be used to suitably gate the graphene devices under appropriate operating conditions. For single-gated devices, semiconducting gates are comparable to metallic gates below liquid helium temperatures but include resistivity features resulting from gate voltage clamping of the semiconductor. In dual-gated devices, we pin down the parameter range of effective operation and find that the semiconducting depletion regime results in clamping and hysteresis from defect-state charge trapping.</p>

As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems.

            <p>The model of a chain of springs and masses (CSM), originating from the works of Schrödinger (1914), and Pater (1974), is found suitable as an analytical description of the dynamics of layers in orientated FCC crystals. An analytical extension of that model has been developed for the case of linear-in-time ramp pressure applied to a sample surface. Examples are provided of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, confirming the usefulness of the model in the description of dynamic effects on steel 310S under pressure. Qualitatively the same results have been obtained by us for several other medium-entropy alloys CoNiCr (with EAM and MEAM inter-atomic potentials), and CoNiV (with MEAM potential). For studies of dynamic stability on large sizes of samples and for long times, the proposed earlier table-style harmonic interlayer potential has been used. The results of MD simulations suggest that the dynamics of the CSM model of perfectly ordered matter is described by stretched-exponential time functions, and it is characterised by simple scaling relations in time and size of the sample.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen, Fengyi Zhou, Yan Suo, Cheng Shao, Xu Cheng, Duo Wang, Biplab Sanyal</p>
            <p>We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.</p>

            <p>For over three decades, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been a key method for exploring material structures and functionalities at nanometer and often atomic scales in ambient, liquid, and vacuum environments. Historically, SPM applications have predominantly been downstream, with images and spectra serving as a qualitative source of data on the microstructure and properties of materials, and in rare cases of fundamental physical knowledge. However, the fast-growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput. SPM inherently meets these criteria, offering a rich and diverse array of data from a single measurement. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements. We discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead, asserting that SPM will play a crucial role in closing the loop from material prediction and synthesis to characterization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bharti Matta, Philipp Rosenzweig, Kathrin Küster, Craig Polley, Ulrich Starke</p>
            <p>Intercalation is a robust approach for modulating the properties of epitaxial graphene on SiC and stabilizing two-dimensional (2D) intercalant layers at the graphene/SiC interface. In this work, we present synchrotron-based angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements focussing on the band structure of intercalated Pb under a single layer of epitaxial graphene. The interlayer Pb exhibits a metallic character, a $(1 \times 1)$ registry with respect to SiC, and free electron-like bands to a first order. Divergences from the free electron approximation include various band splittings and gaps throughout the Pb Brillouin zone. Light polarization dependent ARPES measurements indicate a predominant out-of-plane orbital character for the Pb bands, suggesting potential interactions between the interlayer Pb and graphene's $\pi$ orbitals that may induce proximity effects in graphene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a $(1 \times 1)$ Pb monolayer on SiC show a reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed interlayer bands as well as the polarization dependent measurements. Finally, temperature dependent ARPES measurements reveal that the nearly charge-neutral graphene layer involves charge transfer from both the interlayer Pb and the substrate SiC.</p>

            <p>The discovery of many strongly correlated metallic phases has inspired different routes to generalize or go beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi liquid theory. To this end, from universal consideration of symmetries and anomalies, Else, Thorngren and Senthil (ETS) have introduced a class of theories called ersatz Fermi liquids which possess a Fermi surface and satisfy a generalized Luttinger's theorem. In this work, we view all such fermion liquids obeying the Luttinger theorem as incompressible quantum Hall liquids in higher-dimensional phase space and use it as the starting point to derive their effective low-energy field theory. The noncommutativity of phase space motivates us to use the Seiberg-Witten map to derive the field theory in an ordinary (commutative) space and naturally leads to terms that correspond to the correct topological Chern-Simons action postulated by ETS in one, two, and three dimensions. Additionally, our approach also reproduces all the non-topological terms that characterize important contributions to the response, including the semiclassical equations of motion. Finally, our derivations of Chern-Simons terms from the Seiberg-Witten map also verify a longstanding conjecture in noncommutative field theory.</p>

            <p>Embedding quantum dot circuits into microwave cavities has emerged as a novel platform for controlling photon emission statistics by electrical means. With such a circuit version of the Rabi model, we reveal previously undefined quantum phase transitions in electrically driven lasing regimes, which do not require deep strong light-matter couplings. For one-photon interaction, the scaling analysis indicates that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition from thermal to coherent photon emissions. Going beyond this, a discontinuous quantum phase transition from superbunched to coherent states in two-photon processes, accompanied by the bistability within a mean-field theory, is predicted. Both the order of phase transitions and the critical electron-photon coupling can be easily controlled by an electric field, while the tunneling current can be used as a fingerprint of such transitions. Our prediction, along with its extension to multiphoton processes, represents a key step towards accessing lasing phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts luminescent defects possessing spin qualities compatible with quantum sensing protocols at room temperature. Vacancies, in particular, are readily obtained via exposure to high-energy ion beams. While the defect creation mechanism via such irradiation is well understood, the occurrence rate of optically active negatively charged vacancies ($V_B^-$) is an open question. In this work, we exploit focused helium ions to systematically generate optically active vacancy defects in hBN flakes at varying density. By comparing the density-dependent spin splitting measured by magnetic resonance to calculations based on a microscopic charge model, in which we introduce a correction term due to a constant background charge, we are able to quantify the number of $V_B^-$ defects generated by the ion irradiation. We find a lower bound for the fraction (0.2%) of all vacancies in the optically active, negatively charged state. Our results provide a protocol for measuring the generation efficiency of $V_B^-$, which is necessary for understanding and optimizing luminescent centers in hBN.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics.

This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Giusfredi, Stefano Iubini, Antonio Politi, Paolo Politi</p>
            <p>Some lattice models having two conservation laws may display an equilibrium phase transition from a homogeneous (positive temperature - PT) to a condensed (negative temperature) phase, where a finite fraction of the energy is localized in a few sites. We study one such stochastic model in an out-of-equilibrium setup, where the ends of the lattice chain are attached to two PT baths. We show that localized peaks may spontaneously emerge, acting as infinite-temperature heat baths. The number $N_b$ of peaks is expected to grow in time $t$ as $N_b \sim \sqrt{\ln t}$, as a consequence of an effective freezing of the dynamics. Asymptotically, the chain spontaneously subdivides into three intervals: the two external ones lying inside the PT region; the middle one characterized by peaks superposed to a background lying along the infinite-temperature line. In the thermodynamic limit, the Onsager formalism allows determining the shape of the whole profile.</p>

            <h2>Double-Crucible Vertical Bridgman Technique for Stoichiometry-Controlled Chalcogenide Crystal Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingdong Guan, Suguru Yoshida, Jairo Obando-Guevara, Seng Huat Lee, Heike Pfau, Zhiqiang Mao</p>
            <p>Precise stoichiometry control in single-crystal growth is essential for both technological applications and fundamental research. However, conventional growth methods often face challenges such as non-stoichiometry, compositional gradients, and phase impurities, particularly in non-congruent melting systems. Even in congruent melting systems like Bi2Se3, deviations from the ideal stoichiometric composition can lead to significant property degradation, such as excessive bulk conductivity, which limits its topological applications. In this study, we introduce the double-crucible vertical Bridgman (DCVB) method, a novel approach that enhances stoichiometry control through the combined use of continuous source material feeding, traveling-solvent growth, and liquid encapsulation, which suppresses volatile element loss under high pressure. Using Bi2Se3 as a model system, we demonstrate that crystals grown via DCVB exhibit enhanced stoichiometric control, significantly reducing defect density and achieving much lower carrier concentrations compared to those produced by conventional Bridgman techniques. Moreover, the continuous feeding of source material enables the growth of large crystals. This approach presents a promising strategy for synthesizing high-quality, large-scale crystals, particularly for metal chalcogenides and pnictides that exhibit challenging non-congruent melting behaviors.</p>

            <h2>A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadine Suzan Cetin, Michal Pavelka, Emil Varga</p>
            <p>A standard description of superfluid helim-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond HVBK. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher normal velocities, where the splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-component model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.</p>

            <h2>Coupling between small polarons and ferroelectricity in BaTiO3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darin Joseph, Cesare Franchini</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional DFT and DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brajagopal Das, Cinthia Piamonteze, Lior Kornblum</p>
            <p>Magnetic anisotropy in complex oxides often originates from the complex interplay of several factors, including crystal structure, spin-orbit coupling, and electronic interactions. Recent studies on Ru-substituted $La_{0.70}Sr_{0.30}MnO_3$ (Ru-LSMO) films demonstrate emerging magnetic and magneto-transport properties, where magnetic anisotropy plays a crucial role. However, the atomic origin and underlying mechanisms of the magnetic anisotropy of this material system remain elusive. This work sheds light on these aspects. Detailed element-specific X-ray magnetic dichroism analysis suggests that Ru single ion anisotropy governs the overall magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the magnetic property of Mn ions changes dramatically due to strong antiferromagnetic coupling between Ru and Mn ions. Our findings clarify the role of Ru single ion anisotropy behind magnetic anisotropy in Ru-LSMO, offering a promising avenue for designing advanced materials with tailored magnetic properties for next generation magnetic and spintronic technologies. As the Curie temperature of these materials is close to room temperature, such tunable magnetic anisotropy holds prospects for functional room-temperature magnetic devices.</p>

            <p>We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener this http URL results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</p>

            <p>A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, the 80:20 ratio, is at the basis of the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning allows for fine-tuning internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli, and ensuring robust performance. At present, engineered structures of competing components are, however, largely unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked with frustration mechanisms in the hosting network. In this context, the spin glass theory has shown how an apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic chaotic behavior arises from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states preventing the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we tackle the problem of disentangling topology and dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We make use of the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical arena and complex energy landscape of the system. This unveils novel, highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of their still-unknown set of pure states at zero temperature.</p>

            <p>The Raman spectrum of monolayer (ML) MoS$_2$ is remarkably affected by the interaction with metals. In this work we studied ML-MoS$_2$ supported by the Ag(111) and Ag(110) surfaces by using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The MoS$_2$ layer was directly grown on atomically clean Ag(111) and Ag(110) surfaces by pulsed laser deposition, followed by in-situ thermal annealing under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The morphology and structure of the two systems were characterized in-situ by scanning tunneling microscopy, providing atomic-scale information on the relation between the MoS$_2$ lattice and the underlying surface. Raman spectroscopy revealed differences between the two MoS$_2$-metal interfaces, especially concerning the behavior of the out-of-plane $A'_1$ vibrational mode, which splits into two contributions on Ag(110). The metal-induced effects on MoS$_2$ vibrational modes are further evidenced by transferring MoS$_2$ onto a more inert substrate (SiO$_2$/Si), where the MoS$_2$ Raman response displays a more ``freestanding-like'' behavior. The experimental data were interpreted with the support of ab-initio calculations of the vibrational modes, which provided insight into the effect of interface properties, such as strain and out-of-plane distortion. Our results highlight the influence of the interaction with metals on MoS$_2$ vibrational properties, and show the high sensitivity of MoS$_2$ Raman modes to the surface structure of the supporting metal.</p>

Models in this family expand the performance-speed-memory Pareto frontier, offering near SoTA performance across a range of evaluations with a >10x reduction in latency and > 8x reduction in memory. Our experiments systematically traverse this frontier, charting the trade-off induced by roto-equivariance, conservatism and graph sparsity. Contrary to recent literature, we find that non-equivariant, non-conservative architectures can accurately model physical properties, including those which require higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface. This model release is guided by the principle that the most valuable foundation models for atomic simulation will excel on all fronts: accuracy, latency and system size scalability. The reward for doing so is a new era of computational chemistry driven by high-throughput and mesoscale all-atom simulations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits</h2>

            <p>Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>The remarkable complexity of the vacuum state of a topologically-ordered many-body quantum system encodes the character and intricate braiding interactions of its emergent particles, the anyons.} Quintessential predictions exploiting this complexity use the Fibonacci string-net condensate (Fib-SNC) and its Fibonacci anyons to go beyond classical computing. Sampling the Fib-SNC wavefunction is expected to yield estimates of the chromatic polynomial of graph objects, a classical task that is provably hard. At the same time, exchanging anyons of Fib-SNC is expected to allow fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. Nevertheless, the physical realization of Fib-SNC and its anyons remains elusive. Here, we introduce a scalable dynamical string-net preparation (DSNP) approach, suitable even for near-term quantum processors, which dynamically prepares Fib-SNC and its anyons through reconfigurable graphs. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we couple the DSNP approach with composite error-mitigation on deep circuits to successfully create, measure, and braid anyons of Fib-SNC in a scalable manner. We certify the creation of anyons by measuring their `anyon charge', finding an average experimental accuracy of $94\%$. Furthermore, we validate that exchanging these anyons yields the { expected} golden ratio~$\phi$ with~$98\%$ average accuracy and~$8\%$ measurement uncertainty. Finally, we sample the Fib-SNC to estimate the chromatic polynomial at~$\phi+2$ for {several} graphs. Our results establish the proof of principle for using Fib-SNC and its anyons for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and {for aiming at} a classically-hard problem.</p>

In particular, we derive all the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second-moment operators for these structured random circuits under a solvable condition, by establishing a link to the Kitaev chain, and show that their spectral gaps can exceed those of Haar random circuits.

However, a closer look reveals new length and time scales introduced by quantum dipole fluctuations due to interband mixing, which are reflected in the momentum space textures of the electronic wavefunctions. This structure is usually referred to as quantum geometry. The scales introduced by geometry not only qualitatively modify the linear and nonlinear responses of a material but can also have a vital role in determining the many-body ground state. This review explores how quantum geometry impacts properties of materials and outlines recent experimental advances that have begun to explore quantum geometric effects in various condensed matter platforms. We discuss the separation of scales that can allow us to estimate the significance of quantum geometry in various response functions.</p>

We argue that in this phase effective dipole coupling to the electric field is important, with the spin-current coupling potentially being the dominant mechanism for spin-1/2. For this setting, we use linear spin wave theory to evaluate the leading nonlinear polarization response which is of second order in the driving field. We show that the response function features a strong antidiagonal, galvanoelectric feature. The width of this feature is set by relaxation rates beyond the noninteracting magnon picture, thereby providing access to single-magnon lifetimes within the multi-magnon continuum of the response function. Moreover, the response function is shown to display various structures in the two-dimensional frequency plane related to exceptional regions of the magnon dispersion.</p>

            <p>For a neutral system of positive and negative charges, such as atoms in a crystal, increasing the density causes the Mott transition from bound electrons to free electrons. The density of optically generated electron-hole systems can be controlled in situ by the power of optical excitation that enables the Mott transition from excitons, the bound pairs of electrons and holes, to free electrons and holes with increasing density. These Mott transitions occur in systems of pairs of the same kind, such as atoms or excitons. However, a different type of the Mott transition can occur for Bose polarons. A Bose polaron is a mobile particle of one kind in a Bose gas of particles of another kind. For the Mott transition in polarons, the polaron states vanish with increasing density of the surrounding gas. In this paper, we present the observation of this type of the Mott transition and the measurement of the Mott transition parameter $n_{\rm M}^{1/2} a_{\rm B}$ in 2D excitonic Bose polarons.</p>

            <p>Spin-$1/2$ kagome antiferromagnets are leading candidates for realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground states. While QSL ground states are predicted for the pure Heisenberg model, understanding the robustness of the QSL to additional interactions that may be present in real materials is a forefront question in the field. Here we employ large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations to investigate the effects of next-nearest neighbor exchange couplings $J_2$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions $D$, which are relevant to understanding the prototypical kagome materials herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite. By utilizing clusters as large as XC12 and extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit, we precisely delineate the scope of the QSL phase, which remains robust across an expanded parameter range of $J_2$ and $D$. Direct comparison of the simulated static and dynamic spin structure factors with inelastic neutron scattering reveals the parameter space of the Hamiltonians for herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite, and, importantly, provides compelling evidence that both materials exist within the QSL phase. These results establish a powerful convergence of theory and experiment in this most elusive state of matter.</p>

Antiferromagnetic insulators exhibit significant potential for facilitating ultrafast pure spin currents by terahertz magnons. Consequently, we here use femtosecond laser pulses to trigger ultrafast spin currents across antiferromagnetic NiO thin films in Py|NiO|Pt stacks, where permalloy (Py) and Pt serve as spin-current source and detector respectively. We find that the spin current pulses traversing NiO reach a velocity up to 40 nm/ps and experience increasing delay and broadening as the NiO thickness is increased. We can consistently explain our observations by ballistic transport of incoherent magnon.

Moreover, we reveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional moiré unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental exploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a single-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of fractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations determine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and ferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the charge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal activation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations. Overall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical tensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical framework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related systems.</p>

            <h2>Learning to erase quantum states: thermodynamic implications of quantum learning theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haimeng Zhao, Yuzhen Zhang, John Preskill</p>
            <p>The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</p>

            <p>An open-source and modular Python package, Catalight, is developed and demonstrated to automate (photo)catalysis measurements. (Photo)catalysis experiments require studying several parameters to evaluate performance, including temperature, gas flow rate and composition, illumination power, and spectral profile. Catalight orchestrates measurements over this complicated parameter space and systematically stores, analyzes, and visualizes the resulting data. To showcase the capabilities of Catalight, we perform an automated apparent activation barrier measurement of acetylene hydrogenation over a plasmonic AuPd catalyst on Al2O3 support, simultaneously varying laser power, wavelength, and temperature in a multi-day experiment controlled by a simple Python script. Our chemical results unexpectedly show an increased activation barrier upon light excitation, contrary to previous findings for other plasmonic reactions and catalysts. We show that the reaction rate order with respect to both acetylene and hydrogen is unchanged upon illumination, suggesting that molecular surface coverage is not changing under light excitation. By analyzing the inhomogeneity of the laser induced heating, we attribute these results to a partial photothermal effect combined with a photochemical/hot electron driven mechanism. Our findings highlight the capabilities of a new experiment automation tool; explore the photocatalytic mechanism for an industrially relevant reaction; and identify systematic sources of error in canon photocatalysis experimental procedures.</p>

            <h2>Multifunctional steep-slope spintronic transistors with spin-gapless-semiconductor or spin-gapped-metal electrodes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ersoy Şaşıoğlu, Paul Bodewei, Nicki F. Hinsche, Ingrid Mertig</p>
            <p>Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.</p>

            <p>Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper atom and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.</p>

            <p>We study the properties of photons in a cryogenic cavity, made by cryo-cooled mirrors surrounded by a room temperature environment. We model such a system as a multimode cavity coupled to two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. Using a Lindblad master equation approach, we derive the photon distribution and the statistical properties of the cavity modes, finding an overall non-thermal state described by a mode-dependent effective temperature. We also calculate the dissipation rates arising from the interaction of the cavity field with the external environment and the mirrors, relating such rates to measurable macroscopic quantities. These results provide a simple theory to calculate the dissipative properties and the effective temperature of a cavity coupled to different thermal reservoirs, offering potential pathways for engineering dissipations and photon statistics in cavity settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. A. Saltykova, A. V. Yulin, I. A. Shelykh</p>
            <p>Cavity polaritons, hybrid half-light half-matter excitations in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime demonstrate clear signatures of quantum collective behavior, such as analogues of BEC and superfluidity at surprisingly high temperatures. The analysis of the formation of these states demands an account of the relaxation processes in the system. Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role.</p>

            <p>Quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) is a many-body embedding method designed to describe condensed systems with strongly correlated electrons localized within a given region of space, for example spin defects in semiconductors and insulators. Although the QDET approach has been successful in predicting the electronic properties of several point defects, several limitations of the method remain. In this work, we propose multiple advances to the QDET formalism. We derive a double-counting correction that consistently treats the frequency dependence of the screened Coulomb interaction, and we illustrate the effect of including unoccupied orbitals in the active space. In addition, we propose a method to describe hybridization effects between the active space and the environment, and we compare the results of several impurity solvers, providing further insights into improving the reliability and applicability of the method. We present results for defects in diamond and for molecular qubits, including a detailed comparison with experiments.</p>

            <p>Achieving a large spin splitting is highly desirable for spintronic devices, which often requires breaking of the inversion symmetry. However, many atomically thin films are centrosymmetric, making them unsuitable for spintronic applications. Here, we report a strategy to achieve inversion symmetry breaking from a centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer PtTe$_2$, leading to a giant Rashba spin splitting. Specifically, the thermal annealing turns one layer of PtTe$_2$ sample into a transition metal monochalcogenide (TMMC) PtTe through Te extraction, thus forming PtTe/PtTe$_2$ heterostructure with inversion symmetry breaking. In the naturally-formed PtTe/PtTe$_2$ heterostructure, we observe a giant Rashba spin splitting with Rashba coefficient of $\alpha_{R}$ = 1.8 eV$\cdot$$Å$, as revealed by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Our work demonstrates a convenient and effective pathway for achieving pronounced Rashba splitting in centrosymmetric TMDC thin films by creating TMMC/TMDC heterostructure, thereby extending their potential applications to spintronics.</p>

So far, experimental progress on light-field dressed states has been mainly focused on the occupied states, however, it is unclear if the transient photo-excited states above the Fermi energy $E_F$ can also be dressed, leaving the dynamical interplay between photo-excitation and light-field dressing elusive. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence for light-field dressing of the transient photo-excited surface states above $E_F$, which exhibits distinct dynamics with a delay response as compared to light-field dressed states below $E_F$. Our work reveals the dual roles of the pump pulse in both photo-excitation and light-field dressing, providing a more comprehensive picture with new insights on the light-induced manipulation of transient electronic states.</p>

We find that the optical frequency and the relaxation time of the material can be used to control the photo-transport of magnons. In addition, under the condition of low light frequncy and infinite relaxation time, the longitudinal magnon photo-transport is related to the topological property of the magnon system.</p>

The superconducting phase emerges from a normal state exhibiting anomalous Hall effects and sustains an large perpendicular critical magnetic field. Our results present the first example of superconductivity emerging within a flat Chern band that simultaneously hosts fractional quantum anomalous effects, a phenomenon never observed in any other systems.

Key signatures-including a fully spin/valley polarized normal state, anomalous Hall resistivity hysteresis, superconducting phase adjacent to the fractional Chern insulating state and a narrow superconducting dome at zero gating field-collectively indicate chiral superconductivity driven by intravalley pairing of electrons. Within the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism, we compute the superconducting phase diagram via random phase approximation, incorporating Coulomb repulsion in a realistic continuum model. Our results identify a dominant intravalley pairing with a narrow superconducting dome of p+ip type at zero gate field. This chiral phase contrasts sharply with the much weaker time-reversal-symmetric intervalley pairing at finite gating field. Our work highlights the role of band topology in achieving robust topological superconductivity, and supports the chiral and topological nature of the superconductivity observed in twisted MoTe2.</p>

            <p>Collective modes are coherent excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), and their study provides insight into the macroscopic quantum phenomena that govern these systems. Collective mode frequencies can be used to probe the properties of BECs, such as the trap geometry, the interatomic interactions, and the presence of defects; hence, it is essential to develop methods for high-resolution determination of collective mode frequencies. A standard technique consists of a single pulse of an external oscillatory field, which we denote Rabi-like due to the analogy with the field of nuclear magnetic resonances. In this work, we propose a method to achieve a better resolution than the Rabi-like protocol, which consists of two oscillating fields separated in time, which we call Ramsey-like. We focus on BECs in harmonic traps, considering mainly the quadrupole and breathing modes for different trap anisotropy values and comparing the results using single and double excitation zones. First, we employ a variational approach with a Thomas-Fermi ansatz, which gives rise to dynamical equations that are numerically solved. Then, we modeled the problem as a three-level system, offering a concise and alternative description of the same dynamics, enabling the idea of coherent control of these collective modes. Both approaches show that the Ramsey-like protocol provides a better resolution than the Rabi-like. This offers the possibility of measuring collective mode frequencies with higher precision, which is important in experiments where they are used as indirect measurements of properties that are difficult to probe.</p>

            <p>The zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) have emerged as a promising candidate for catalysis, carbon-dioxide (CO$_{2}$) capture and storage as well as flue gas separation due to their tunable porosity and chemical stability. ZIFs consists of transition metals in a tetrahedral coordination with imidazolate linkers, allowing for structural modifications that can enhance CO$_{2}$ adsorption and storage. To systematically design and optimize ZIFs for superior CO$_{2}$ capture performance, theoretical modelling provides an effective approach, though hindered by the sheer size of the search space, with hundred to thousands of possible sites per ZIF, and thousands of possible ZIF that can be synthesized. In this work, we employ a high-throughput techniques underpinned by first-principle Density Functional Theory (DFT) to develop a systematic automated method for characterizing adsorption energetics in ZIFs, guiding the rational design and selection of desirable ZIF structures. Using high-throughput computing tools, we perform pore and pore size analysis, and implement automated CO$_{2}$ molecule placement algorithm, accounting for positional symmetry, crystallographic orientation, and collision detection. The results obtained are in good agreement with previous studies, demonstrating the reliability of the approach in accelerating the discovery of next-generation ZIFs for CO$_{2}$ capture and storage.</p>

We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$.

            <p>The topological characteristics of energy bands in crystalline systems are encapsulated in the Berry curvature of the bulk Bloch states. In photonic crystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a non-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of how the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses. Within this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field polarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the crystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the honeycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk topology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is contingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence completely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can hold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational symmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys of the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on generalized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with localized couplings and Hermiticity.</p>

It remains an interesting challenge to find Hamiltonians with realistic interactions that stabilize this state. Here, we describe composite boson and composite fermion theories that highlight the importance of $(p_x+ip_y)^m$ excitonic pairing in stabilizing FEIs in a class of band inversion models. We predict a sequence of Jain-like and Laughlin-like FEI states, the simplest of which has the topological order of the bosonic $\nu=1/2$ fractional quantized Hall state.

            <p>The anaerobic bacterium \textit{Geobacter sulfurreducens} produces extracellular, electronically conductive cytochrome polymer wires that are conductive over micron length scales. Structure models from cryo-electron microscopy data show OmcS wires form a linear chain of hemes along the protein wire axis, which is proposed as the structural basis supporting their electronic properties. The geometric arrangement of heme along OmcS wires is conserved in many multiheme c-type cytochromes and other recently discovered microbial cytochrome wires. However, the mechanism by which this arrangement of heme molecules support electron transport through proteins and supramolecular heme wires is unclear. Here, we investigate the site energies, inter-heme coupling, and long-range electronic conductivity within OmcS. We introduce an approach to extract charge carrier site information directly from Kohn-Sham density functional theory, without employing projector schemes. We show that site and coupling energies are highly sensitive to changes in inter-heme geometry and the surrounding electrostatic environment, as intuitively expected. These parameters serve as inputs for a quantum charge carrier model that includes decoherence corrections with which we predict a diffusion coefficient comparable with other organic-based electronic materials. Based on these simulations, we propose that dynamic disorder, particularly due to perturbative inter-heme vibrations allow the carrier to overcome trapping due to the presence of static disorder \textit{via} small frequency-dependent fluctuations. These studies provide insights into molecular and electronic determinants of long-range electronic conductivity in microbial cytochrome wires and highlight design principles for bioinspired, heme-based conductive materials.</p>

            <p>Large-scale integration of semiconductor spin qubits into industrial quantum processors hinges on the ability to characterize the performance of quantum components at scale. While the semiconductor industry has addressed scalable testing for transistors using device matrix arrays, extending this approach to quantum dot spin qubits is challenged by their operation at sub-kelvin temperatures, in the presence of magnetic fields, and by the use of radio-frequency signals. Here, we present QARPET (Qubit-Array Research Platform for Engineering and Testing), a scalable architecture for characterizing spin qubits using a quantum dot crossbar array with sublinear scaling of interconnects. The crossbar features tightly pitched (1 {\mu}m), individually addressable spin qubit tiles and is implemented in planar germanium, by fabricating a large device with the potential to host 1058 hole spin qubits. We focus our measurements on a patch of 40 tiles and demonstrate key device functionality at millikelvin temperature including unique tile addressability, threshold voltage and charge noise statistics, and characterisation of hole spin qubits and their coherence times in a single tile. These demonstrations pave the way for a new generation of quantum devices designed for the statistical characterisation of spin qubits and for developing automated routines for quantum dot tuning and spin qubit operation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nagamalleswararao Dasari, Hugo U. R. Strand, Martin Eckstein, Alexander I. Lichtenstein, Evgeny A. Stepanov</p>
            <p>Ultrafast irradiation of correlated electronic systems triggers complex dynamics involving quasi-particle excitations, doublons, charge carriers, and spin fluctuations. To describe these effects, we develop an efficient non-equilibrium approach, dubbed D-$GW$, that enables a self-consistent treatment of local correlations within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and spatial charge and spin fluctuations, that are accounted for simultaneously within a diagrammatic framework. The method is formulated in the real-time domain and provides direct access to single- and two-particle momentum- and energy-dependent response functions without the need for analytical continuation, which is required in Matsubara frequency-based approaches. We apply the D-$GW$ method to investigate the dynamics of a photo-excited extended Hubbard model, the minimal system that simultaneously hosts strong charge and spin fluctuations. Focusing on the challenging parameter regime near the Mott transition, we demonstrate that correlated metals and narrow-gap Mott insulators undergo distinct thermalization processes involving complex energy transfer between single-particle and collective electronic excitations.</p>

            <p>Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) has been observed across many Eu$^{2+}$-based materials; however, its origin is not completely understood. Here we investigate the antiferromagnetic insulator EuZn$_2$P$_2$ through single crystal x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, electrical transport, magnetization, dilatometry, and electron spin resonance measurements complemented by density functional theory calculations. Our electrical resistivity data reveal a large negative magnetoresistance, $MR = [R(H)-R(0)]/R(0)$, that reaches $MR = -99.7\%$ at 9~T near the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature $T_N=23\ \text{K}$. Dilatometry measurements show an accompanying field-induced lattice strain. Additionally, Eu$^{2+}$ electron spin resonance reveals a strong ferromagnetic exchange interaction between Eu$^{2+}$ and conduction electrons. Our experimental results in EuZn$_2$P$_2$ are consistent with a magnetic polaron scenario and suggest magnetic polaron formation as a prevailing explanation of CMR in Eu$^{2+}$-based compounds.</p>

            <p>Understanding charge separation dynamics in organic semiconductor blends is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic photovoltaic solar cells. In this study, we explored the optoelectronic properties and charge separation dynamics of a PCE10:FOIC blend, by combining steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopies with high-level DFT calculations. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed a significant reduction of the exciton-exciton annihilation recombination rate in the acceptor when incorporated into the blend, compared to its pristine form. This reduction was attributed to a decrease in exciton density within the acceptor, driven by an efficient hole-separation process that was characterized by following the temporal evolution of the transient signals associated with the excited states of the donor when the acceptor was selectively excited within the blend. The analysis of these dynamics enabled the estimation of the hole separation time constant from the acceptor to the donor, yielding a time constant of (1.3 +- 0.3) ps. Additionally, this study allowed the quantification of exciton diffusion and revealed a charge separation efficiency of approximately 60%, providing valuable insights for the design of next-generation organic photovoltaic materials with enhanced charge separation and improved device efficiency.</p>

            <p>Controlling doping is key to optimizing graphene for high-speed electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, its impact on non-equilibrium carrier lifetimes remains debated. Here, we systematically tune the doping level of quasi-freestanding epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) via potassium deposition and probe its ultrafast carrier dynamics directly in the band structure using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES). We find that increased doping lowers both the peak electronic temperature and the cooling rate of Dirac carriers, which we attribute to higher electronic heat capacity and reduced phonon emission phase space. Comparing quasi-freestanding graphene with graphene on a carbon buffer layer reveals faster relaxation in the latter, likely due to additional phonon modes being available for heat dissipation. These findings offer new insights for optimizing graphene in electronic and photonic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Limitations of the $g$-tensor formalism of semiconductor spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zoltán György, András Pályi, Gábor Széchenyi</p>
            <p>The $g$-tensor formalism is a powerful method for describing the electrical driving of semiconductor spin qubits. However, up to now, this technique has only been applied to the simplest qubit dynamics, resonant monochromatic driving by a single gate. Here we study the description of (i) monochromatic driving using two driving gates and bichromatic driving via (ii) one or (iii) two gates. Assuming a general Hamiltonian with qubit states well separated from excited orbital states, we find that when (i) two driving gates are used for monochromatic driving or (ii) a single one for bichromatic, the $g$-tensor formalism successfully captures the leading-order dynamics. We express the Rabi frequency and the Bloch-Siegert shift using the $g$-tensor and its first and second derivatives with respect to the gate voltage. However, when (iii) bichromatic driving is realized using two distinct driving gates, we see a breakdown of $g$-tensor formalism: the Rabi frequency cannot be expressed using the $g$-tensor and its derivatives. We find that beyond the $g$-tensor and its derivatives, three additional parameters are needed to capture the dynamics. We demonstrate our general results by assuming an electron (hole) confined in a circular quantum dot, subjected to Rashba spin-orbit interaction.</p>

            <p>Hot carrier solar cells (HCSCs), harvesting excess energy of the hot carriers generated by above-band-gap photoexcitation, is crucial for pushing the solar cell efficiency beyond the Shockley Queisser limit, which is challenging to realize mainly due to fast hot-carrier cooling. By performing transient reflectance spectroscopy in a MoSe2/hBN/WS2 junction, we demonstrate the gate-tunable harvest of hot electrons from MoSe2 to WS2. By spectrally distinguishing hot-electron extraction from lattice temperature increase, we find that electrostatically doped electrons in MoSe2 can boost hot-electron extraction density (n_ET) by factor up to several tens. Such enhancement arises from interaction between hot excitons and doped electrons, which converts the excess energy of hot excitons to excitations of the Fermi sea and hence generates hot electrons. Moreover, n_ET can be further enhanced by reducing the conduction band offset with external electric field. Our results provide in-depth insights into design of HCSCs with electrostatic strategies.</p>

            <p>Bilayer graphene (BLG)-based quantum devices represent a promising platform for emerging technologies such as quantum computing and spintronics. However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p>

            <p>The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) is a fascinating emergent quantum state characterized by fractionally charged excitations in the absence of magnetic field,which could arise from the intricate interplay between electron correlation, nontrivial topology and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, FQAHE has been realized in aligned rhombohedral pentalayer graphene on BN superlattice (aligned R5G/BN), where the topological flat band is modulated by the moiré potential. However, intriguingly, the FQAHE is observed only when electrons are pushed away from the moiré interface. The apparently opposite implications from these experimental observations, along with different theoretical models, have sparked intense debates regarding the role of the moiré potential. Unambiguous experimental observation of the topological flat band as well as moiré bands with energy and momentum resolved information is therefore critical to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Here by performing nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (NanoARPES) measurements, we directly reveal the topological flat band electronic structures of R5G, from which key hopping parameters essential for determining the fundamental electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene are extracted. Moreover, a comparison of electronic structures between aligned and non-aligned samples reveals that the moiré potential plays a pivotal role in enhancing the topological flat band in the aligned sample. Our study provides experimental guiding lines to narrow down the phase space of rhombohedral graphene, laying an important foundation for understanding exotic quantum phenomena in this emerging platform.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziye Zhu, Xunkai Duan, Jiayong Zhang, Bowen Hao, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou</p>
            <p>Multiferroic altermagnets offer new opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling and electrically tunable spintronics. However, due to intrinsic symmetry conflicts between altermagnetism and ferroelectricity, achieving their coexistence, known as ferroelectric altermagnets (FEAM), remains an outstanding challenge, especially in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, we propose a universal, symmetry-based design principle for 2D FEAM, supported by tight-binding models and first-principles calculations. We show that ferroelectric lattice distortions can break spin equivalence and introduce the necessary rotational symmetry, enabling altermagnetism with electrically reversible spin splitting. Guided by this framework, we identify a family of 2D vanadium oxyhalides and sulfide halides as promising FEAM candidates. In these compounds, pseudo Jahn-Teller distortions and Peierls-like dimerization cooperatively establish the required symmetry conditions. We further propose the magneto-optical Kerr effect as an experimental probe to confirm FEAM and its electric spin reversal. Our findings provide a practical framework for 2D FEAM and advancing electrically controlled spintronic devices.</p>

In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics.

            <p>We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET), designed for transporting quantum energy across space-time. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When both supplier and recipient operate within the same time frame, this is called Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET). A proof-of-concept was performed for the Ising model, utilizing quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3% to around 40%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across space-time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ewan McCulloch, J. Alexander Jacoby, Curt von Keyserlingk, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in topological phases have opened new frontiers in materials science and quantum physics. However, their emergence in strongly correlated systems are less understood due to the complex interplay between particle interactions and band topology. In this work, we consider a cold-atom-based spin-dependent Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with a non-Hermitian dynamical gauge field (DGF), where two kinds of topologically correlated bound states are found to emerge from the DGF. Specifically, edge bound states with co-localization of both spin species arise from the interplay between DGF and nontrivial single-particle topology, and bulk bound states with extended distribution in the lattice emerges from nontrivial topology of inter-species band inversion. These bound states can coexist in same parameter regimes and compete with each other, leading to distinguished dynamical signatures. This work bridges the gap between conventional band topology and strongly correlated physics, establishing a new paradigm for discovering emergent topological phenomena in quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Finn Bohte, Theophile Louvet, Vincent Maillou, Marc Serra Garcia</p>
            <p>Mechanical systems played a foundational role in computing history, and have regained interest due to their unique properties, such as low damping and the ability to process mechanical signals without transduction. However, recent efforts have primarily focused on elementary computations, implemented in systems based on pre-defined reservoirs, or in periodic systems such as arrays of buckling beams. Here, we numerically demonstrate a passive mechanical system$\unicode{x2014}$in the form of a nonlinear mass-spring model$\unicode{x2014}$that tackles a real-world benchmark for keyword spotting in speech signals. The model is organized in a hierarchical architecture combining feature extraction and continuous-time convolution, with each individual stage tailored to the physics of the considered mass-spring systems. For each step in the computation, a subsystem is designed by combining a small set of low-order polynomial potentials. These potentials act as fundamental components that interconnect a network of masses. In analogy to electronic circuit design, where complex functional circuits are constructed by combining basic components into hierarchical designs, we refer to this framework as springtronics. We introduce springtronic systems with hundreds of degrees of freedom, achieving speech classification accuracy comparable to existing sub-mW electronic systems.</p>

            <p>We numerically investigate the motion of elongated microparticles in microfluidic channels at low Reynolds numbers. In channels with smooth walls, asymmetric initial conditions -- including particle orientation and lateral position -- lead to continuous variations in particle trajectories, potentially exhibiting repeated behavior depending on the channel geometry and initial conditions. However, we find that introducing periodically textured walls induces alignment of the particle with the channel centerline within a specific range of texture wavelengths. This occurs as the textured pattern disrupts the uniformity of the flow, creating localized high-velocity nodes that repeatedly guide the particle toward the centerline as it moves downstream. Notably, the characteristic length scale over which this alignment forms reduces with increasing particle elongation and diverges with increasing Reynolds number. Our findings reveal that elongation-induced alignment can be leveraged for microfluidic filtering applications, enabling the efficient separation of microparticles based on their geometric properties. This work opens new avenues for designing microfluidic devices tailored for high-precision particle sorting, with broad implications for biomedical and industrial applications.</p>

            <p>Frequency combs have revolutionized communication, metrology and spectroscopy. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing integrated combs, predominantly relying on Pockels or Kerr mechanisms. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new type of frequency comb-Floquet cavity frequency comb-that does not rely on intrinsic non-linearity. By periodically modulating the resonance frequency of a cavity, a giant-mode cavity with multiple equally spaced frequency components is created. The pump tone interacts with the pre-modulated cavity, generating the output frequency comb. This approach offers a flexible tuning range and operates in a threshold-less manner, obviating the need to overcome nonlinear initiation thresholds. We implement this on a microwave cavity optomechanical system on-chip. Compared to Kerr optomechanical combs, this approach efficiently generates comb with pump signal far from the cavity's intrinsic frequency, and the power required for detection is reduced by approximately a factor of ($10^6$), providing a promising platform for frequency comb generation.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interactions in crystals are powerful tools that seamlessly allow both functionalities of sizeable bandgap modulation and non-invasive spectroscopy. While we often assume that the border between the two regimes of modulation and detection is sharp and well-defined, there are experiments where the boundaries fade. The study of these transition regions allows us to identify the real potentials and inherent limitations of the most commonly used optical spectroscopy techniques. Here, we measure and explain the co-existence between bandgap modulation and non-invasive spectroscopy in the case of resonant perturbative nonlinear optics in an atomically thin direct gap semiconductor. We report a clear deviation from the typical quadratic power scaling of second-harmonic generation near an exciton resonance, and we explain this unusual result based on all-optical modulation driven by the intensity-dependent optical Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts in the $\pm$K valleys of the Brillouin zone. Our experimental results are corroborated by analytical and numerical analysis based on the semiconductor Bloch equations, from which we extract the resonant transition dipole moments and dephasing times of the used sample. These findings redefine the meaning of perturbative nonlinear optics by revealing how coherent light-matter interactions can modify the band structure of a crystal, even in the weak-field regime. Furthermore, our results strengthen the understanding of ultrafast all-optical control of electronic states in two-dimensional materials, with potential applications in valleytronics, Floquet engineering, and light-wave electronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angelo Russotto, Filiberto Ares, Pasquale Calabrese</p>
            <p>Recent work has shown that the entanglement of finite-temperature eigenstates in chaotic quantum many-body local Hamiltonians can be accurately described by an ensemble of random states with an internal $U(1)$ symmetry. We build upon this result to investigate the universal symmetry-breaking properties of such eigenstates. As a probe of symmetry breaking, we employ the entanglement asymmetry, a quantum information observable that quantifies the extent to which symmetry is broken in a subsystem. This measure enables us to explore the finer structure of finite-temperature eigenstates in terms of the $U(1)$-symmetric random state ensemble; in particular, the relation between the Hamiltonian and the effective conserved charge in the ensemble. Our analysis is supported by analytical calculations for the symmetric random states, as well as exact numerical results for the Mixed-Field Ising spin-$1/2$ chain, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaoticity.</p>

            <p>Time-reversal symmetry, together with space-inversion symmetry, is one of the defining properties of crystals, underlying phenomena such as magnetism, topology and non-trivial spin textures. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide an excellent tunable model system to study the interplay between time-reversal and space-inversion symmetry, since both can be engineered on demand by tuning the number of layers and via all-optical bandgap modulation. In this work, we modulate and study time-reversal symmetry using third harmonic Kerr rotation in mono- and bilayer TMDs. By illuminating the samples with elliptically polarized light, we achieve spin-selective bandgap modulation and consequent breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The reduced symmetry modifies the nonlinear susceptibility tensor, causing a rotation of the emitted third harmonic polarization. With this method, we are able to probe broken time-reversal symmetry in both non-centrosymmetric (monolayer) and centrosymmetric (bilayer) crystals. Furthermore, we discuss how the detected third harmonic rotation angle directly links to the spin-valley locking in monolayer TMDs and to the spin-valley-layer locking in bilayer TMDs. Thus, our results define a powerful approach to study broken time-reversal symmetry in crystals regardless of space-inversion symmetry, and shed light on the spin, valley and layer coupling of atomically thin semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Hydroxide Mobility in Aqueous Systems: Ab Initio Accuracy with Millisecond Timescales</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Hänseroth, Daniel Sebastiani, Jakob Scholl, Karl Skadell, Christian Dreßler</p>
            <p>We present a multiscale simulation approach for hydroxide transport in aqueous solutions of potassium hydroxide, combining ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with force field ensemble averaging and lattice Monte Carlo techniques. This method achieves near ab initio accuracy by capturing the femtosecond scale dielectric relaxation dynamics of the aqueous hydrogen bonding network, while extending the simulation capability to millisecond diffusion timescales. This extraordinary extension of the available length and time scales enables future studies of hydroxide mobility in functional materials such as nanostructured anion-exchange membranes, where hydroxide ions migrate through nanometer-sized channels. Remarkably, our approach demonstrates that a single AIMD trajectory is sufficient to predict hydroxide conductivity over a range of concentrations, underscoring its computational efficiency and relevance to the design of advanced energy materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fedor K. Popov, Yifan Wang</p>
            <p>We introduce generalized pinning fields in conformal field theory that model a large class of critical impurities at large distance, enriching the familiar universality classes. We provide a rigorous definition of such defects as certain unbounded operators on the Hilbert space and prove that when inserted on codimension-one surfaces they factorize the spacetime into two halves. The factorization channels are further constrained by symmetries in the bulk. As a corollary, we solve such critical impurities in the 2d minimal models and establish the factorization phenomena previously observed for localized mass deformations in the 3d ${\rm O}(N)$ model.</p>

            <h2>The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas J. Fiderer, Paul C. Barth, Isaac D. Smith, Hans J. Briegel</p>
            <p>Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning, biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy. This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in active learning systems.</p>

            <h2>Diagrammatic expansion for the mutual-information rate in the realm of limited statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kühn, Gabriel Mahuas, Ulisse Ferrari</p>
            <p>Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The Mutual information has been broadly applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data, and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information in arbitrary orders in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single binss. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.</p>

            <h2>Continuum Limit of Dendritic Deposition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Jacobson, Thomas F. Miller III</p>
            <p>Continuum models are commonly used to study dendritic deposition in fields ranging from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to battery research. However, the continuum approximation underlying these models is poorly understood, even in the simplified case of Brownian particles depositing onto a small, reactive cluster. Specifically, this system transitions from a compact to a dendritic morphology at a critical radius that depends on the particle size. But in simulations of the continuum (small-particle) limit, the critical radius does not reproduce the scaling predicted by a purely continuum analysis. This discrepancy suggests that continuum models may not be able to capture the microscopic physics of dendrite formation, raising doubts about their experimental relevance. To clarify the continuum limit of dendritic deposition, here, we reexamine the critical radius scaling of the Brownian particle system using Brownian dynamics simulations. Compared to past studies, we probe larger system sizes, up to hundreds of millions of particles in some cases, and adopt an improved paradigm for the surface reaction. This paradigm allows us to converge our simulations and to work with well-defined physical parameters. Our results show that the critical radius scaling is, in fact, consistent with the continuum analysis, validating the continuum approach to modeling dendritic deposition. Nonetheless, the Brownian particle system converges to its continuum limit slowly. As a result, when applying continuum models to more complex deposition processes, the continuum approximation itself may be a significant source of error.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that discontinuous shear thickening (DST) can occur even in moderately dense, inertial suspensions of hydrodynamically interacting, frictionless soft particles. Using the Lubrication-Friction Discrete Element Method, our simulations reveal that DST can emerge at lower particle densities, provided that both the inertia of the suspended particles and their softness are sufficiently pronounced. Furthermore, we show that, under these conditions, the DST behavior obtained from the simulation qualitatively agrees with that predicted by kinetic theory, even without accounting for hydrodynamic interactions. These findings expand the understanding of DST in soft particle systems and highlight the importance of particle inertia and softness in controlling rheological behavior.</p>

This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that are of quantum origin. These quantum-active features are revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short timescales.</p>

This paper offers a novel approach, drawing inspiration from the Neumann problem for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations.

We explore solutions for specific classical cases to demonstrate its efficacy, such as a cardioid domain, a ring domain with a shifted hole, and a gear-like structure. This work enhances the toolkit for researchers and practitioners tackling isotropic planar elastostatic challenges with a unified and flexible approach.</p>

            <p>We present time-domain THz spectroscopy of thin films of the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. Below the $\approx$ 40 K Kondo coherence temperature, a narrow Drude-like peak forms, as the result of the $f$ orbital - conduction electron hybridization and the formation of the heavy-fermion state. The complex optical conductivity is analyzed through a Drude model and extended Drude model analysis. Via the extended Drude model analysis, we measure the frequency-dependent scattering rate ($1/ \tau $) and effective mass ($m^*/m_b$). This scattering rate shows a linear dependence on temperature, which matches the dependence of the resistivity as expected. Nevertheless, the width of the low-frequency Drude peak itself that is set by the {\it renormalized} quasiparticle scattering rate ($1 / \tau^* = m_b/ m^* \tau $) shows a $T^2$ dependence. This is the scattering rate that characterizes the relaxation time of the renormalized quasiparticles. This gives evidence for Fermi liquid state, which in conventional transport experiments is hidden by the strong temperature dependent mass.</p>

            <h2>Competing interlayer interactions in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene: From spontaneous electric polarization to quasi-magic angle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-En Tseng, Mei-Yin Chou</p>
            <p>The family of moiré materials provides a powerful platform for tuning interlayer couplings via the twist angle in systems with large spatial periodicity. In trilayer graphene systems, interlayer couplings at the two interfaces can possibly be tuned separately, and the competition between these interactions can therefore influence the electronic structure in a significant way. In this study, we investigate the electronic properties of twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (aAB) beyond the continuum model, using first-principles calculations combined with an accurate tight-binding model. We find that at large twist angles, the electronic features of aAB are well described by the interaction between the parabolic bands of the Bernal AB-bilayer and the Dirac bands of the twisted monolayer, resulting in a spontaneous electric polarization in the former that splits the parabolic bands. As the twist angle decreases, the coupling between adjacent layers at the twisted interface becomes dominant, which makes aAB look like twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) interacting with the outer Bernal layer. A moiré potential emerges in the TBG-like layers, leading to charge localization, while the outer Bernal layer exhibits charge delocalization with substantial sublattice polarization at the atomic scale. Furthermore, we identify narrow bands with a minimum width at a quasi-magic angle of 1.16 degrees, closely matching the magic angle of TBG. The enhanced electron correlation expected in these narrow bands suggests that aAB is a promising platform for exploring correlated electronic phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting bias in optimal finite-time copying protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daan Mulder, Pieter Rein ten Wolde, Thomas E. Ouldridge</p>
            <p>We study a finite-time cyclic copy protocol that creates persisting correlations between a memory and a data bit. The average work to copy the two states of the data bit consists of the mutual information created between the memory and data bit after copying, a cost due to the difference between the initial and final states of the memory bit, and a finite-time cost. At low copy speeds, the optimal initial distribution of the memory bit matches the bias in the expected outcome, set by the bias in the data bit and the copying accuracies. However, if both states of the data are copied with the same accuracy, then in the high-speed regime copying the unlikely data bit state becomes prohibitively costly with a biased memory; the optimal initial distribution is then pushed towards 50:50. Copying with unequal accuracies, at fixed copy-generated mutual information, yields an opposite yet more effective strategy. Here, the initial memory distribution becomes increasingly biased as the copy speed increases, drastically lowering the work and raising the maximum speed. This strategy is so effective that it induces a symmetry breaking transition for an unbiased data bit.</p>

            <p>Predicting the emergent properties of impurities immersed in a quantum bath is a fundamental challenge that can defy quasiparticle treatments. Here, we measure the spectral properties and real-time dynamics of mobile impurities injected into a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, using two broad Feshbach resonances to tune both the impurity-bath and intrabath interactions. For attractive impurity-bath interactions, the impurity spectrum features a single branch, which away from the resonance corresponds to a well-defined attractive polaron; near the resonance we observe dramatic broadening of this branch, suggesting a breakdown of the quasiparticle picture. For repulsive impurity-bath interactions, the spectrum features two branches: the attractive branch that is dominated by excitations with energy close to that of the Feshbach dimer, but has a many-body character, and the repulsive polaron branch. Our measurements show that the behavior of impurities in weakly interacting baths is remarkably universal, controlled only by the bath density and a single dimensionless interaction parameter.</p>

In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional charged Andreev bound states in a superconductor with a sublattice degree of freedom, where the sign of charge density of the Andreev bound states oscillates between the two sublattices. The oscillating-charged Andreev bound states lead to a complete breakdown of the proportionality among the electron part of the spectral function, the local density of states, and the tunneling conductance spectrum for energies below the superconducting gap. We also discuss the possible occurrence of these Andreev bound states in UTe$_2$ and locally noncentrosymmetric superconductors.</p>

By utilizing this feature, we propose a device that integrates the functions of both a Cooper pair splitter and a spin beam splitter, thereby creating energy-entangled electron pairs. The positive nonlocal conductance and the positive noise cross-correlation are unambiguous signatures of specular Andreev reflections in the proposed device.</p>

Our calculations of CO adsorption on surfaces where a first row transition metal atom replaces a Cu atom show that multiple CO molecules, not just one, bind to the substitutional atom. For Fe, Co, and Ni atoms, a decrease in binding energy is found, but the reverse trend, namely increasing bond strength, is found for V, Cr, and Mn and the first three CO molecules. Magnetic moment, charge, and position of the substitutional atom are also strongly affected by the CO adsorption in most cases. Magnetic moment is stepwise reduced to zero, and the outward displacement of the substitutional atom increased.</p>

Moreover, we identify two additional impacts of external electric and magnetic fields on the Josephson current: (i) Fields can induce 0-$\pi$ transitions. (ii) Fields can substantially enhance the critical current. This enhancement is surprising since supercurrents are typically suppressed by magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>Despite the recent success of identifying experimental signatures of the orbital Hall effect (OHE), the research on the microscopic mechanisms behind this unique phenomenon is still in its infancy. Here, using a gapped 2D Dirac material as a model system of the OHE, we develop a microscopic theory of orbital transport which captures extrinsic disorder effects non-perturbatively. We show that it predicts several hitherto unknown effects, including (i) a strong dependence of the orbital Hall conductivity with the strength and symmetry of the impurity scattering potential, and (ii) a smooth crossover from intrinsic to extrinsic OHE as a function of the Fermi energy and impurity density. In contrast to previous (perturbative) studies, the OHE is found to exhibit bona fide diffusive behavior in the dilute impurity limit, which we trace back to the dominance of skew scattering-type processes. More generally, we argue that the newly unveiled orbital skew scattering mechanism governs the diffusive OHEs of a large class of 2D materials even when the crystal structure is inversion-symmetric. Our work unveils the crucial nature of non-perturbative vertex corrections for a complete description of orbital transport and confirms common short-range impurities as key enablers of the OHE.</p>

            <p>Over the last decade, experimental measurements of electrostatic screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes have exceeded theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. This disagreement has led to a paradigm in which such screening lengths are referred to as 'anomalous underscreening', while moderate screening lengths - predominantly those predicted by theory and molecular simulation - are referred to as 'normal underscreening'. Herein we use discrete Fourier analysis of the radial charge density obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to confirm the presence of many electrostatic screening modes present at any one time. We present a new approach for extracting screening lengths directly from the bulk charge density that reveals the origins of both normal and anomalous underscreening. These results reconcile a decades-old disagreement between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes.</p>

The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p>

            <p>Critical states represent a fundamental and fascinating research frontier in Anderson localization physics, known for their non-ergodic properties, including multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge up to now. In this work, we establish a universal mechanism demonstrating that critical states must maintain dual-space invariance in both position and momentum representations, leading to delocalized dynamics in both spaces. Therefore, our discovery soundly answers this long-standing unsolved puzzle regarding the definition of the critical state and its rigorous characterization. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we prove rigorously that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces as expected. Subsequent numerical simulations provide the smoking gun for the correctness of the dual-space invariance, thereby not only highlighting the universality of the rigorous mechanism, but also establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</p>

            <p>Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are becoming increasingly important due to their high electrical efficiency, the flexible choice of fuels and relatively low emissions of pollutants. However, the increasingly growing demands for electrochemical devices require further performance improvements. Since it is well known that the 3D morphology of the electrodes, which is significantly influenced by the underlying manufacturing process, has a profound impact on the resulting performance, a deeper understanding for the structural changes caused by modifications of the manufacturing process or degradation phenomena is desirable. In the present paper, we investigate the influence of the annealing time and the operating temperature on the 3D morphology of SOFC anodes using 3D image data obtained by focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy, which is segmented into gadolinium-doped ceria, nickel and pore space. In addition, structural differences caused by manufacturing the anode via infiltration or powder technology, respectively, are analyzed quantitatively by means of various geometrical descriptors such as specific surface area, length of triple phase boundary per unit volume, mean geodesic tortuosity, and constrictivity. The computation of these descriptors from 3D image data is carried out both globally as well as locally to quantify the heterogeneity of the anode structure.</p>

            <h2>Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naoki Matsumura, Yuta Yoshimoto, Tamio Yamazaki, Tomohito Amano, Tomoyuki Noda, Naoki Ebata, Takatoshi Kasano, Yasufumi Sakai</p>
            <p>Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing >10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with >10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</p>

            <h2>Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the \textit{chiral anomaly}. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ is constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios: the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of (1) the same pseudospin variety and exhibiting Berry-curvature profiles differing by an overall factor of $\chi$, or (2) two distinct pseudospin representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.</p>

            <h2>Entropy estimation for partially accessible Markov networks based on imperfect observations: Role of finite resolution and finite statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas H. Fritz, Benjamin Ertel, Udo Seifert</p>
            <p>Estimating entropy production from real observation data can be difficult due to finite resolution in both space and time and finite measurement statistics. We characterize the statistical error introduced by finite sample size and compare the performance of three different entropy estimators under these limitations for two different paradigmatic systems, a four-state Markov network and an augmented Michaelis-Menten reaction scheme. We consider the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, a waiting-time based estimator for resolved transitions and a waiting-time based estimator for blurred transitions in imperfect observation scenarios. For perfect measurement statistics and finite temporal resolution, the estimator based on resolved transitions performs best in all considered scenarios. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation gives a better estimate than the estimator based on blurred transitions at low driving affinities, whereas the latter performs better at high driving affinities. Furthermore, we find that a higher temporal and spatial resolution leads to slower convergence of measurement statistics, implying that for short measurement times, a lower resolution may be beneficial. Additionally, we identify a self-averaging effect for the waiting-time based entropy estimators that can reduce their variance for observations with finite statistics.</p>

            <h2>Vision transformer based Deep Learning of Topological indicators in Majorana Nanowires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>1D superconductor-semiconductor nanowires are the leading candidates for topological quantum computation due to their ability to host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, the standard methods for identifying MZMs are often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many properties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial disorder induced Andreev bound states. Recent works clearly indicate the need for developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this study, we utilize a generalized Vision Transformer-based neural network to predict, using tunnel conductance measurements, both whether a device manifests a topological MZMs phase in the presence of disorder, and also to map out the entire topological phase diagram. We show the ability of our method up to arbitrary confidence ($P>0.9998$) in classifying a device as possessing a non-trivial MZM-carrying topological phase for a wide variety of disorder parameters. We demonstrate an ability to predict from conductance measurements alternative (to the extensively used scattering-matrix-invariant topological indicator) Majorana indicators based on local density of states (LDOS). This is relevant since topology may not be uniquely defined by the scattering invariant in short disordered wires. This work serves as a significant advance offering a step towards the practical realization of Majorana-based quantum devices, enabling a deep-learning understanding of the topological properties in disordered nanowire systems. We validate our method using extensive simulated Majorana results in the presence of disorder, and suggest using this technique for the analysis of experimental data in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Majorana platforms.</p>

            <p>We investigate spin dynamics in $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) heterostructures, uncovering a robust mechanism for in-situ modulation of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) through precise control of temperature, applied magnetic field and crystal orientation. Employing cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the interfacial coupling between the Néel vector of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and the magnetization of the Py layer is highly tunable across the Morin transition temperature $(T_M)$. Our experiments reveal distinct resonance behavior for different crystal orientations, highlighting the pivotal role of exchange coupling strength in dictating FMR frequencies. Theoretical modeling corroborates the experimental findings, elucidating the dependence of coupling on the relative alignment of the Néel vector and ferromagnetic magnetization. Notably, we achieve significant modulation of FMR frequencies by manipulating the Néel vector configuration, facilitated by temperature variations, applied magnetic fields and crystal orientation adjustments. These advancements demonstrate the potential for dynamic control of spin interactions in AFM/FM heterostructures, paving the way for the development of advanced spintronic devices with tunable magnetic properties. Our work provides critical insights into the fundamental interactions governing hybrid spin systems and opens new avenues for the design of versatile, temperature-responsive magnetoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>Based on the $6\times6$ Kane model in the spherical approximation, both the electron and the hole subband dispersions in a cylindrical HgTe nanowire are calculated using analytical method. The transcendental equations determining the subband energies in the nanowire are analytically derived by utilizing both the total angular momentum conservation and the hard wall boundary condition. We show there exists topological band transition in the HgTe nanowire, very similar to that demonstrated in a HgTe quantum well. Via tuning the radius of the nanowire, we find there is a gap-closing-and-reopening transition in the subband structure. When the radius is larger than the critical radius $R_{\rm c}\approx3.2$ nm, the HgTe nanowire is in the inverted regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvatore D. Pace, Arkya Chatterjee, Shu-Heng Shao</p>
            <p>Dualities of quantum field theories are challenging to realize in lattice models of qubits. In this work, we explore one of the simplest dualities, T-duality of the compact boson CFT, and its realization in quantum spin chains. In the special case of the XX model, we uncover an exact lattice T-duality, which is associated with a non-invertible symmetry that exchanges two lattice U(1) symmetries. The latter symmetries flow to the momentum and winding U(1) symmetries with a mixed anomaly in the CFT. However, the charge operators of the two U(1) symmetries do not commute on the lattice and instead generate the Onsager algebra. We discuss how some of the anomalies in the CFT are nonetheless still exactly realized on the lattice and how the lattice U(1) symmetries enforce gaplessness. We further explore lattice deformations preserving both U(1) symmetries and find a rich gapless phase diagram with special $\mathrm{Spin}(2k)_1$ WZW model points and whose phase transitions all have dynamical exponent ${z>1}$.</p>

            <h2>The Smearing of Quasi-Particles: Signatures in the Entanglement Entropy of Excited Many-Particle Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jagannath Sutradhar, Jonathan Ruhman, Avraham Klein, Dimitri Gutman, Richard Berkovits</p>
            <p>The entanglement spectrum serves as a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems, revealing key information about symmetry, topology, and excitations. While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Active and transfer learning with partially Bayesian neural networks for materials and chemicals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarah I. Allec, Maxim Ziatdinov</p>
            <p>Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Bassanoni, Alessandro Vezzani, Eli Barkai, Raffaella Burioni</p>
            <p>Even in a simple stochastic process, the study of the full distribution of time integrated observables can be a difficult task. This is the case of a much-studied process such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process where, recently, anomalous dynamical scaling of large deviations of time integrated functionals has been highlighted. Using the mapping of a continuous stochastic process to a continuous time random walk via the "excursions technique'', we introduce a comprehensive formalism that enables the calculation of the complete distribution of the time-integrated observable $A = \int_0^T v^n(t) dt$, where $n$ is a positive integer and $v(t)$ is the random velocity of a particle following Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics. We reveal an interesting connection between the anomalous rate function associated with the observable $A$ and the statistics of the area under the first-passage functional during an excursion. The rate function of the latter, analyzed here for the first time, exhibits anomalous scaling behavior and a dynamical phase transition, both of which are explored in detail. The case of the anomalous scaling of large deviations, originally associated to the presence of an instantonic solution in the weak noise regime of a path integral approach, is here produced by a so called "big jump effect'', in which the contribution to rare events is dominated by the largest excursion. Our approach, which is quite general for continuous stochastic processes, allows to associate a physical meaning to the anomalous scaling of large deviations, through the big jump principle.</p>

            <p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p>

This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters.

            <p>BaZrS3 is a chalcogenide perovskite that has shown promise as a photovoltaic absorber, but its performance is limited because of defects and impurities that have a direct influence on carrier concentrations. Functional dopants that show lower donor-type or acceptor-type formation energies than naturally occurring defects can help tune the optoelectronic properties of BaZrS3. In this work, we applied first principles computations to comprehensively investigate the defect landscape of BaZrS3, including all intrinsic defects and a set of selected impurities and dopants. BaZrS3 intrinsically exhibits n-type equilibrium conductivity under both S-poor and S-rich conditions, which remains largely unchanged in the presence of O and H impurities. La and Nb dopants created stable donor-type defects, which made BaZrS3 even more n-type, whereas As and P dopants formed amphoteric defects with relatively high formation energies. This work highlights the difficulty of creating p-type BaZrS3 owing to the low formation energies of donor defects, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Defect formation energies were also used to compute expected defect concentrations and make comparisons with experimentally reported values. Our dataset of defects in BaZrS3 paves the path for training machine learning models to subsequently perform larger-scale prediction and screening of defects and dopants across many chalcogenide perovskites, including cation-site or anion-site alloys.</p>

            <p>We explore the energy spectrum and eigenstates of two-component atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions in the presence of spin-dependent ultra long-range Rydberg molecule (ULRM) potentials, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The attractive ULRM potentials lead to local density accumulation, while their difference results in a local polarization potential and induces the in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states whose energies lie below the bulk energy gap. A transition from equal-population to population-imbalance occurs as the pairing strength falls below a critical value, accompanied by the emergence of local Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) like states characterized by out-of-phase wave functions and lower energies compared to the YSR states. The negative contribution emanating from the FFLO-like states also causes a sign change in the gap function within the ULRM potentials. Depending on the Rydberg state generating the ULRM potentials, the transition towards population-imbalance can be on either the BCS or the Bose-Einstein condensation side of the Fermi superfluid. Additionally, spin-polarized bound states arise along with oscillatory ``clumpy states" to compensate for the local density difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations and measurements of the composite Rydberg atom-Fermi superfluid system.</p>

In addition, we observed a giant paramagnetic-Meissner effect peak at about 48 K, which further supports the existence of a superconductive transition just above it. Furthermore, an asymmetric or nonreciprocal and non-hysteretic superconductive diode effect was observed. The later could be fully polarized, and its polarity could be reversed. In our films we identified the infinite-layer 112 and the perovskite 113 phases, with a variety of oxygen stoichiometries in between.</p>

            <p>Graphene nanomechanical resonators are well suited for the study of parametric oscillations. Their large frequency tunability and their pronounced nonlinearities enable an efficient modulation of their resonant frequencies. Here, we present measurements of the response of few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonators, each driven by a large parametric pump at frequency $2\omega$ and a weak external drive at $\omega$, where $\omega$ is set near the mechanical resonant frequency $\omega_0$. The pump actuates the resonator beyond the threshold for large-amplitude parametric oscillations, while the drive breaks the symmetry between the parametric phase states. By increasing and decreasing a gate voltage to detune $\omega_0$ in the presence of the pump and the drive, we observe a double hysteresis in the response. The double hysteresis reveals the existence of two possible large-amplitude vibrational states whose phase difference is nearly $\pi$ radians. We deterministically prepare the resonator in either one of these states by cycling the gate voltage. We measure the stationary occupation probabilities of the two states in the presence of a white Gaussian force noise, and find that they strongly depend on the amplitude and on the phase of the external drive. The phase states of parametric oscillations with broken amplitude symmetry can be mapped to biased bi-modal degrees of freedom, such as Ising spins in an external magnetic field. Therefore, they hold promise as units of binary information.</p>

            <p>In orbital Chern insulators, the chemical potential acts as a tuning knob to reverse chirality in dissipationless edge currents, enabling electric-field control of magnetic order-key for future quantum electronics. Despite the rise of orbital Chern insulators, electrically switchable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains rare, necessitating further investigation. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced reversal of orbital Chern insulators in a moire superlattice composed of rhombohedral heptalayer graphene (r-7LG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. At one electron per moire unit cell, two emerging Chern insulating phases - one pointing away from and the other toward graphene's charge neutrality point in the phase diagram of carrier density (n) versus magnetic field (B) - exhibit energetic competition modulated by both n and B. This switchable QAHE chirality in r-7LG demonstrates a layer-number dependent response: similar phenomena in moire r-6LG require much higher magnetic fields and are absent in thinner rhombohedral graphene. Our findings establish moire-engineered rhombohedral graphene as a promising platform for exploring topological quantum materials with electrically controllable chiral edge modes and magnetic order.</p>

            <p>Materials informatics (MI), emerging from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to significantly accelerate material development and discovery. The data used in MI are derived from both computational and experimental studies; however, their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that is trained on the experimental dataset to the compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained datasets to construct materials maps, which visualize the relationships between material properties and structural features, aiming to support experimental researchers. The materials map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements materials property prediction using graph-based representations of material structure and deep learning modeling. Through statistical analysis, we find that the MDL framework using the message passing neural network (MPNN) architecture efficiently extracts features reflecting the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we find that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in the prediction of material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-defined order states play essential roles in determining the emergent exotic physical properties in condensed matter physics, including charge density wave (CDW), polar charge order, and superconducting (SC) states. Recently, the interweaved CDW and antipolar states have been discovered in a low-symmetric superatomic crystal of (Au6Te12Se8, ATS), while their delicate interplay with the following emergent SC state at lower temperature remains elusive. Here, we report a real-space experimental investigation on the coexistence and competition of CDW, polar and SC states in the metallic crystal of ATS using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy combined with transport and Raman measurements. We show that the CDW order is gradually suppressed with the decreased temperature, and a further transformation from antipolar to ferrielectric-like order occurs with the inversion-symmetric broken at the SC state. These spatially observed the emergence and competition of the above ordered states coincide with the temperature-dependent transport and Raman measurements. We predict that the delicate interplay among these states may contribute exotic "hidden" orders in this superatomic metal, suggesting a unique platform for the exploration of intriguing quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery</h2>

            <p>Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content widely utilized in biomedical applications. Injectable depot-forming hydrogels for drug delivery offer sustained release of biomolecular cargo, leveraging controlled macromolecular diffusion within dynamic networks to promote extended immunity and favorable immunological responses. However, mitigating burst release while maintaining sustained-release properties remains a challenge due to network disruption during needle extrusion, leading to excessive short-term cargo release and local toxicity. While controlling both short- and long-term release profiles would mitigate this issue, it remains a persistent challenge. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy for self-regulating, post-injection network evolution enabled by exchange of functional molecules with physiological environment, achieving controlled cargo release over both short and long durations. By tuning network viscoelasticity, we optimized rheological properties to minimize burst release while preserving sustained-release profiles. Using model protein cargo, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated reduced burst release and comparable sustained-release to unmodified control formulations. These findings highlight a novel strategy for precise cargo delivery in biomedical applications.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Persistent Zero Modes and Superconducting Vortex Doublets in UTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nileema Sharma, Matthew Toole, James McKenzie, Fangjun Cheng, Sean Michael Thomas, Priscila F. S. Rosa, Yi-Ting Hsu, Xiaolong Liu</p>
            <p>Superconducting vortices can reveal electron pairing details and nucleate topologically protected states. Yet, vortices of bulk spin-triplet superconductors have never been visualized. Recently, UTe$_2$ has emerged as a nominative spin-triplet superconductor, but its superconducting order parameter is elusive, and whether time-reversal symmetry is broken remains unsettled. Here, we visualize superconducting vortices on the (011) surface of ultra-clean UTe$_2$ single crystals ($T_c=2.1 K$) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We introduce $\frac{d^2 I}{dV^2}$ imaging as an effective method for vortex visualization in superconductors with substantial residual zero-energy density of states (DOS), as in UTe$_2$. Anisotropic single-flux-quantum vortices, with coherence lengths of $\sim$ 12 nm (4 nm) parallel (perpendicular) to the a-axis, form a triangular vortex lattice (VL) under small out-of-plane magnetic fields. The vortex size decreases at higher fields, suggesting multi-band superconductivity. The robustness of vortex structures and VL against magnetic field polarity and cooling history strongly supports time-reversal invariant superconductivity. Spatially non-splitting and spectroscopically narrow zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) of differential conductance at vortex cores (VCs) persist up $8T$, well beyond the Pauli limit ($3.9T$), consistent with Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in a topological vortex line protected by a combination of mirror, time-reversal, and particle-hole symmetries. Close examination of vortex structures reveals a mirror-asymmetric doublet $--$ one with a singular core and another with an enhanced energy gap. Such unconventional vortices in a non-chiral $p$-wave superconductor could originate from the induction of a subdominant order parameter close to the VCs.</p>

            <h2>Automated evaluation of imaginary time strong coupling diagrams by sum-of-exponentials hybridization fitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Huang, Denis Golež, Hugo U. R. Strand, Jason Kaye</p>
            <p>We present an efficient separation of variables algorithm for the evaluation of imaginary time Feynman diagrams appearing in the bold pseudo-particle strong coupling expansion of the Anderson impurity model. The algorithm uses a fitting method based on AAA rational approximation and numerical optimization to obtain a sum-of-exponentials expansion of the hybridization function, which is then used to decompose the diagrams. A diagrammatic formulation of the algorithm leads to an automated procedure for diagrams of arbitrary order and topology. We also present methods of stabilizing the self-consistent solution of the pseudo-particle Dyson equation. The result is a low-cost and high-order accurate impurity solver for quantum embedding methods using general multi-orbital hybridization functions at low temperatures, appropriate for low-to-intermediate expansion orders. In addition to other benchmark examples, we use our solver to perform a dynamical mean-field theory study of a minimal model of the strongly correlated compound Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, describing the anti-ferromagnetic transition and the in- and out-of-plane anisotropy induced by spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <p>The metallic oxide RuO$_2$ has emerged as a promising altermagnet candidate, owing to reports of this material hosting antiferromagnetic ordering accompanied by a spin-split electronic band structure characteristic of time-reversal symmetry-breaking. However, recent studies have robustly questioned this scenario. Here we map the Fermi surface of pristine single-crystalline RuO$_2$. By measuring magnetic quantum oscillations of a bulk thermodynamic property, our study resolves the electronic structure present in the bulk of RuO$_2$. Several Fermi sheets are discerned, with a range of effective quasiparticle masses up to five times that of the bare electron mass. We compare our measurements with the predictions for altermagnetic and nonmagnetic Fermi surfaces deduced from density functional theory calculations. The quantum oscillatory frequency spectra correspond very poorly to the profile expected for the case of altermagnetism; by contrast, they correspond well to the nonmagnetic scenario. Our findings place significant constraints on the bulk magnetic properties of RuO$_2$, and strongly suggest that this material is a paramagnet.</p>

            <h2>Momentum-Space AC Josephson Effect and Intervalley Coherence in Multilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mainak Das, Chunli Huang</p>
            <p>Electron transport driven by the phase coherence and interference of quantum many-body wavefunctions is a fascinating phenomenon with potential technological significance. Superconductivity, for example, enables dissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting. Similarly, in charge-density waves, once the phase degree of freedom-representing the collective position of electrons relative to the lattice-is depinned, it generates characteristic broadband noise and intriguing AC-DC interference patterns. In this work, we point out a phase-coherent dynamics in the intervalley coherent (IVC) state, also known as the bond-ordered or Kekulé distorted state, frequently reported in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Under a static magnetic field, the IVC state responds with an oscillating intervalley current, which in turn causes oscillating orbital magnetization, thereby inducing a detectable AC Hall effect. This mechanism mirrors the AC Josephson effect observed in superconductors but now happening in momentum space. In this analogy, the static magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the oscillating intervalley current assumes the role of the AC Josephson current. We present detailed microscopic calculations for all the parameters of the phase-number free-energy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, predicting an orbital magnetization oscillation frequency of approximately 12 GHz at 0.1 Tesla. We comment on this phase-coherent dynamics in other 2D materials like twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Shen Wang, Zun Liang, Brian B. Laird, Yang Yang</p>
            <p>This study proposes a new method for predicting the crystal-melt interfacial free energy ($\gamma$) using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model, enhanced by atomistic simulation data for more accurate density wave profiles. The analysis focuses on the soft-sphere system governed by an inverse power potential that stabilizes both BCC and FCC phases. Equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to obtain density wave amplitude distributions, which serve as inputs for the GL model to predict $\gamma$ and its anisotropy. The predicted $\gamma$ values exhibit strong agreement with prior benchmark simulation experimental studies, particularly for FCC crystal-melt interfaces (CMIs). The GL models for the CMI $\gamma$ are proved to be both computationally efficient and reasonably valid, offering quantitative predictions of $\gamma$ while providing insights into the factors controlling its magnitude and anisotropy. Key improvement is suggested for the variational procedure used in the two-mode CMI free energy functionals, and potential upgrades to the GL model are also proposed to further enhance predictive accuracy.</p>

            <p>Conventional visualization tools such as phase diagrams and convex hulls are ill-suited to visualize multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs) due to their large compositional space that cannot be easily projected onto two dimensions. Here, SymPlex plots are introduced to enable the visualization of various properties along special paths in high-dimensional phase spaces of MPEAs. These are polar heatmaps that plot properties along high-symmetry paths radiating from the parent equimolar MPEA to a set of chosen lower-order compositions. SymPlex plots capture the changes in the energy landscape along the special paths and help visualize the effect of addition or substitution of components on the alloy stability, which can be especially useful to assess processing pathways for additive manufacturing. Thus, SymPlex plots can help guide design of MPEAs by showing connections between compositions and their properties in the high-dimensional phase space with more information concentrated near the equimolar region.</p>

            <p>Chromium tri-halides Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) have recently become a focal point of research due to their intriguing low-temperature,layer-dependent magnetism that can be manipulated by an electric field. This makes them essential candidates for spintronics applications. These magnetic orders are often related to the electronic structure parameters, such as spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Hund's coupling ($J_H$), $p-d$ covalency, and inter-orbital Coulomb interactions. Accurately determining such parameters is paramount for understanding Cr$X_3$ physics. We have used ultra high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy to study Cr$X_3$ across phase transition temperatures. Ligand field multiplet calculations were used to determine the electronic structure parameters by incorporating the crystal field interactions in a distorted octahedral with $C_3$ symmetry. These methods provide the most detailed description of Cr$X_3$ magneto-optical and electronic energetic (terms) to date. For the first time, the crystal field distortion parameters $D\sigma$ and $D\tau$ were calculated, and the energies of $d$ orbitals have been reported. Our RIXS spectroscopic measurements reveal a clear energy separation between spin-allowed quartet states and spin-forbidden doublet states in Cr$X_3$. The role of SOC in Cr $2p$ orbitals for the spin-flip excitations has been demonstrated. The determined 10$Dq$ values are in good agreement with the spectrochemical series, and Racah B follows the Nephelauxetic effect. Such precise measurements offer insights into the energy design of spintronic devices that utilize quantum state tuning within 2D magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Bi2O2Se belongs to a group of quasi-2D semiconductors that can replace silicon in future high-speed/low-power electronics. However, the correlation between crystal/band structure and other physical properties still eludes understanding: carrier mobility increases non-intuitively with carrier concentration; the observed $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity lacks explanation. Moreover, a very high relative out-of-plane permittivity of about 150 has been reported in the literature. A proper explanation for such a high permittivity is still lacking. We have performed infrared (IR) reflectivity and Raman scattering experiments on a large perfect single crystal with defined mosaicity, carrier concentration and mobility. Five of the eight phonons allowed by factor group theory have been observed and their symmetries determined. The IR spectra show that the permittivity measured in the tetragonal plane is as high as ${\epsilon}_r{\approx}500$, and this high value is due to a strong polar phonon with a low frequency of ~34 $cm^{-1}$ (~1 THz). Such an unusually high permittivity allows the screening of charge defects, leading to the observation of high electron mobility at low temperatures. It also allows effective modulation doping providing a platform for high performance 2D electronics. DFT calculations suggest the existence of a very low frequency acoustic phonon ~14 $cm^{-1}$ (~0.4 THz). Both the low frequency phonons cause anomalous phonon DOS, which is reflected in the unconventional temperature dependence of the heat capacity, $c_M{\approx}T^{3.5}$. The temperature-dependent, two-component group velocity is proposed to explains the unusual temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, ${\kappa}{\approx}T^{1.5}$</p>

            <p>We propose the redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm to prepare large configurations of atoms using arrays of dynamic optical traps. Red-rec exploits simple heuristics and exact subroutines to solve atom reconfiguration problems on grids. It admits a fast and efficient implementation suitable for real-time operation. We numerically quantify its performance using realistic physical parameters and operational constraints, both in the absence and presence of loss. Red-rec enables assembling large configurations of atoms with high mean success probability. Fast preparation times are achieved by harnessing parallel control operations that actuate multiple traps simultaneously. Faster preparation times are achieved by rejecting configurations of atoms containing fewer atoms than a given threshold. However, the number of traps required to prepare a compact-centered configuration of atoms on a grid with a probability of 0.5 scales as the 3/2 power of the number of desired atoms. This finding highlights some of the challenges associated with scaling up configurations of atoms beyond tens of thousands of atoms.</p>

            <p>Programmable arrays of optical traps enable the assembly of configurations of single atoms to perform controlled experiments on quantum many-body systems. Finding the sequence of control operations to transform an arbitrary configuration of atoms into a predetermined one requires solving an atom reconfiguration problem quickly and efficiently. A typical approach to solve atom reconfiguration problems is to use an assignment algorithm to determine which atoms to move to which traps. This approach results in control protocols that exactly minimize the number of displacement operations; however, this approach does not optimize for the number of displaced atoms or the number of times each atom is displaced, resulting in unnecessary control operations that increase the execution time and failure rate of the control protocol. In this work, we propose the assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm to improve the performance of assignment-based algorithms in solving atom reconfiguration problems. The aro algorithm uses an assignment subroutine to minimize the total distance traveled by all atoms, a rerouting subroutine to reduce the number of displaced atoms, and an ordering subroutine to guarantee that each atom is displaced at most once. The ordering subroutine relies on the existence of a partial ordering of moves that can be obtained using a polynomial-time algorithm that we introduce within the formal framework of graph theory. We numerically quantify the performance of the aro algorithm in the presence and in the absence of loss, and show that it outperforms the exact, approximation, and heuristic algorithms that we use as benchmarks. Our results are useful for assembling large configurations of atoms with high success probability and fast preparation time, as well as for designing and benchmarking novel atom reconfiguration algorithms.</p>

            <p>Understanding the structure of quantum correlations in a many-body system is key to its computational treatment. For fermionic systems, correlations can be defined as deviations from Slater determinant states. The link between fermionic correlations and efficient computational physics methods is actively studied but remains ambiguous. We make progress in establishing this connection mathematically. In particular, we find a rigorous classification of states relative to $k$-fermion correlations, which admits a computational physics interpretation. Correlations are captured by a measure $\omega_k$, a function of $k$-fermion reduced density matrix that we call twisted purity. A condition $\omega_k=0$ for a given $k$ puts the state in a class $G_k$ of correlated states. Sets $G_k$ are nested in $k$, and Slater determinants correspond to $k = 1$. Classes $G_{k=O(1)}$ are shown to be physically relevant, as $\omega_k$ vanishes or nearly vanishes for truncated configuration-interaction states, perturbation series around Slater determinants, and some nonperturbative eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model. For each $k = O(1)$, we give an explicit ansatz with a polynomial number of parameters that covers all states in $G_k$. Potential applications of this ansatz and its connections to the coupled-cluster wavefunction are discussed.</p>

            <p>We adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling solutions and associated fixed points. Our setting is based on a particular choice of cutoff function which depends on the macroscopic fields. Corrections to the simplified flow equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term.</p>

            <p>The success behind many pseudopotential methods, such as the Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and the Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods, is that these methods are nearly all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips-Kleinman and PAW pseudopotential methods we show that there is an explicit all electron reformulation (which is nearly equivalent). In the all electron reformulation, as part of the basis set, there are regular low wavevector basis wave functions (plane waves) and several, specially chosen, high wavevector basis wave functions that are specialized to the atomic environment relevant to nuclei of the substances studied. Using this as motivation, here we propose a new, PAW method motivated, basis set for small molecules, where we use the LO or lo (Localized Orbitals) basis wave functions, and pair them with a Gaussian basis, e.g. Gaussian Type Orbitals (GTO), for a hybrid basis for small molecules. Contracted Gaussian functions are also possible (CGFs). Several different, but related, LO (lo) basis wave functions are considered. We also show how to extend this idea to Slater basis set, Slater type orbitals (STO), instead of GTO orbitals, combined with LO or lo orbitals. This is done using shape functions.</p>

            <p>We describe a class of spin chains with new physical and computational properties. On the physical side, the spin chains give examples of symmetry-protected topological phases that are defined by non-onsite symmetries, i.e. symmetries that are not a tensor product of single-site operators. These phases can be detected by string-order parameters, but notably do not exhibit entanglement spectrum degeneracy. On the computational side, the spin chains represent a new class of states that can be used to deterministically teleport information across long distances, with the novel property that the necessary classical side processing is a non-linear function of the measurement outcomes. We also give examples of states that can serve as universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation, providing the first examples of such resources without entanglement spectrum degeneracy. The key tool in our analysis is a new kind of tensor network representation which we call split-index matrix product states (SIMPS). We develop the basic formalism of SIMPS, compare them to matrix product states, show how they are better equipped to describe certain kinds of non-onsite symmetries including anomalous symmetries, and discuss how they are also well-suited to describing quantum teleportation and constrained spin chains.</p>

            <p>Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called "compact localized states" (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling) allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition of a few of these.</p>

            <p>An intriguing phenomenon in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics is the asymmetry of thermal processes. Relaxation to thermal equilibrium is the most important dissipative process, being a key concept for the design of heat engines and refrigerators, contributing to the study of foundational questions of thermodynamics, and being relevant for quantum computing through the process of algorithmic cooling. Despite their importance, the dynamics of these processes are far from being understood. We show that the free relaxation to thermal equilibrium follows intrinsically different paths depending on whether it involves the temperature of the system to increase or to decrease. Our theory is exemplified using the recently developed thermal kinematics based on information geometry theory, utilizing three prototypical examples: a two-level system, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and a trapped quantum Brownian particle, in all cases showing faster heating than cooling under the appropriate conditions. A general understanding is obtained based on the spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian and the spectral gap of reciprocal processes.</p>

            <p>Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalised to characterise irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relationship between the entropy change of the system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in relative entropies of the environment. Here we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a massive to massless Klein-Gordon model and analyse the thermodynamic and information-theoretic contributions to a generalised entropy production for various system-environment partitions of the composite system. Our results verify the quantum field theoretical calculations, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the ability of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Itai Arad, Raz Firanko, Omer Gurevich</p>
            <p>We study the steady-state properties of quantum channels with local Kraus operators. We consider a large family that consists of general ergodic 1-local (non-interacting) terms and general 2-local (interacting) terms. Physically, a repeated application of these channels can be seen as a simple model for the thermalization process of a many-body system. We study its steady state perturbatively, by interpolating between the 1-local and 2-local channels with a perturbation parameter $\epsilon$. We prove that under very general conditions, these states are Gibbs states of a quasi-local Hamiltonian. Expanding this Hamiltonian as a series in $\epsilon$, we show that the $k$'th order term corresponds to a $(k+1)$-local interaction term in the Hamiltonian, which follows the same interaction graph as the Kraus channel. We also prove a complementary result suggesting the existence of an interaction strength threshold, under which the total weight of the high-order terms in the Hamiltonian decays exponentially fast. For sufficiently small $\epsilon$, this implies both exponential decay of local correlation functions and a classical algorithm for computing expectation value of local observables in such steady states.

            <h2>Time-Varying Energy Landscapes and Temperature paths: Dynamic Transition Rates in locally Ultrametric Complex Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ángel Morán Ledezma</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the dynamics of complex systems with time-dependent transition rates, focusing on $p$-adic analysis in modeling such systems. Starting from the master equation that governs the stochastic dynamics of a system with a large number of interacting components, we generalize it by $p$-adically parametrizing the metabasins to account for states that are organized in a fractal and hierarchical manner within the energy landscape. This leads to a not necessarily time homogeneous Markov process described by a time-dependent operator acting on an ultrametric space. We prove well-posedness of the initial value problem and analyze the stochastic nature of the master equation with time-dependent transition-operator. We demonstrate how ultrametricity simplifies the description of intra-metabasin dynamics without increasing computational complexity. We apply our theoretical framework to two scenarios: glass relaxation under rapid cooling and protein folding dynamics influenced by temperature variations. In the glass relaxation model, we observe anomalous relaxation behavior where the dynamics slow down during cooling, with lasting effects depending on how drastic the temperature drop is. In the protein folding model, we incorporate temperature-dependent transition rates to simulate folding and unfolding processes across the melting temperature. Our results capture a "whiplash" effect: from an unfolded state, the system folds and then returns to an unfolded state (which may differ from the initial one) in response to temperature changes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of $p$-adic parametrization and ultrametric analysis in modeling complex systems with dynamic transition rate, providing analytical solutions that improve our understanding of relaxation processes in material and biological systems.</p>

            <h2>Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao-Fan Cai, Yu-Chun Wang, Yu-Ran Zhang, Tao Liu, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum trails and memory effects in the phase space of chaotic quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Pizzi</p>
            <p>The eigenstates of a chaotic system can be enhanced along underlying unstable periodic orbits in so-called quantum scars, making it more likely for a particle launched along one such orbits to be found still there at long times. Unstable periodic orbits are, however, a negligible part of the phase space, and a question arises regarding the structure of the wave function elsewhere. Here, we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of a localized wave packet in phase space leaves a "quantum trail" on the eigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along trajectories in phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkable dynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wave packet, the long-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory, which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition for these effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarping procedure allows us to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space of the page.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gábor Domokos, Alain Goriely, Ákos G. Horváth, Krisztina Regős</p>
            <p>Recently, we introduced a new class of shapes, called soft cells which fill space as soft tilings without gaps and overlaps while minimizing the number of sharp corners. We introduced the edge bending algorithm that deforms a polyhedral tiling into a soft tiling and we proved that an infinite class of polyhedral tilings can be smoothly deformed into standard soft tilings. Here, we demonstrate that certain triply periodic minimal surfaces naturally give rise to non-standard soft tilings. By extending the edge-bending algorithm, we further establish that the soft tilings derived from the Schwarz P and Schwarz D surfaces can be continuously transformed into one another through a one-parameter family of intermediate non-standard soft tilings. Notably, by carrying its combinatorial structure, both resulting tilings belong to the first order equivalence class of the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling on the body-centered cubic bcc lattice, highlighting a deep geometric connection underlying these minimal surface configurations. By requiring identical end-tangents for edges in a first order class, we also define second order equivalence classes among tilings and prove that there exist exactly two such classes among soft tilings which share the full symmetry group of the DV-bcc tiling. Additionally, we construct a one-parameter family of tilings bridging standard and non-standard soft tilings, explicitly including the classic Kelvin foam structure as an intermediate configuration. This construction highlights that both the soft cells themselves and the geometric methods employed in their generation provide valuable insights into the structural principles underlying natural forms. We also present the soft tiling induced by the gyroid structure.</p>

            <h2>Transport coefficients of dense nucleon matter at low temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianing Li, Weiyao Ke</p>
            <p>The transport property of cold and dense nucleon matter is important for nuclear physics but is relatively less studied than that at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta>0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</p>

            <p>Model optomechanical systems with photon-vibration interactions linear, quadratic, and cubic in mechanical displacements are studied under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the photon field. The opportunity of transformation of effective potential describing the dynamics of the mechanical resonator from single-well to double-well is demonstrated. The dynamics of the mechanical resonator is considered in the presence of (i) only linear interaction, (ii) only quadratic interaction, (iii) both linear and quadratic interactions, and (iv) all three interactions, while other parameters of the optomechanical system, the modulation optical field, and the initial conditions remain fixed. Quasiperiodic oscillations of the mechanical resonator in the case (i) are replaced by chaotic ones when the cases (ii) or (iii) are realized. It is interesting that in the presence of all three interactions, the chaotic behavior of the mechanical oscillator becomes quasi-periodic. However, increasing the power of the modulation field again leads to chaos.</p>

            <p>Cryogenic solid neon has recently emerged as a pristine solid host for single electron qubits. At ~10 mK temperatures, electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have exhibited exceptionally long coherence times and high operation fidelities. To advance this platform towards a scalable quantum information architecture, systematic characterization of its noise feature is imperative. Here, we show the remarkable resilience of solid neon against charge and thermal noises when eNe qubits are operated away from the charge-insensitive sweet-spot and at elevated temperatures. Without optimizing neon growth, the measured charge (voltage) noise on solid neon is already orders of magnitude lower than that in most stringently grown semiconductors, rivaling the best records to date. Up to 400 mK, the eNe charge qubits operated at ~5 GHz can maintain their echo coherence times over 1 microsecond. These observations highlight solid neon as an ideal host for quantum information processing at higher temperatures and larger scales.</p>

            <h2>Oddities in the Entanglement Scaling of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunny Pradhan, Jesús Cobos, Enrique Rico, Germán Sierra</p>
            <p>We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming</p>
            <p>We show that the thermodynamic limit of a many-body system can reveal entanglement properties that are hard to detect in finite-size systems -- similar to how phase transitions only sharply emerge in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting operational entanglement properties are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract properties of the local observable algebras that emerge in the thermodynamic limit. These properties are insensitive to finite perturbations and hence describe the $\textit{large-scale structure of entanglement}$ of many-body systems. We formulate and discuss the emerging structures and open questions, both for gapped and gapless many-body systems. In particular, we show that every gapped phase of matter, even the trivial one, in $D\geq 2$ dimensions contains models with the strongest possible bipartite large-scale entanglement. Conversely, we conjecture the existence of topological phases of matter, where all representatives have the strongest form of entanglement.</p>

            <p>We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th Rényi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Bootstrapping the Electronic Structure of Quantum Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna O. Schouten, Simon Ewing, David A. Mazziotti</p>
            <p>The last several decades have seen significant advances in the theoretical modeling of materials within the fields of solid-state physics and materials science, but many methods commonly applied to this problem struggle to capture strong electron correlation accurately. Recent widespread interest in quantum materials -- where strong correlation plays a crucial role in the quantum effects governing their behavior -- further highlights the need for theoretical methods capable of rigorously treating such correlation. Here, we present a periodic generalization of variational two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) theory, a bootstrapping-type method that minimizes the ground-state energy as a functional of the 2-RDM without relying on the wavefunction. The 2-RDM is computed directly by semidefinite programming with $N$-representability conditions, ensuring accurate treatment of strongly correlated electronic systems. By exploiting translational symmetry, we significantly reduce computational scaling, enabling applications to realistic materials-scale systems. Additionally, we introduce an alternative to conventional energy band structures: natural-orbital occupation-number bands, which, being independent of mean-field assumptions, offer deeper insights into electron correlation effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying the theory to hydrogen chains, molybdenum disulfide, and nickel oxide, showing that natural-orbital occupation bands correctly capture electronic character in regimes where density functional theory fails. This work represents a major step toward accurately describing the electronic structure of quantum materials using reduced density matrices rather than wavefunctions.</p>

            <p>Transport and local spectroscopy measurements have revealed that monolayers of tungsten ditelluride ($1T'$-WTe$_2$) display a quantum spin Hall effect and an excitonic gap at neutrality, besides becoming superconducting at low electron concentrations. With the aim of studying the competition among different broken-symmetry phases upon electron doping, we have performed extensive Hartree-Fock calculations as a function of electron density and Coulomb interaction strength. At charge neutrality, we reproduce the emergence of a spin density wave and a spin spiral state surrounding a quantum spin Hall insulator at intermediate interaction strengths. For stronger interactions, the spin spiral is disrupted by a state breaking both inversion and time-reversal symmetries (but not their product) before the system becomes a trivial band insulator. With electron doping the quantum spin Hall insulator evolves into an easy-plane ferromagnet due to a Stoner-like instability of the conduction band. This phase competes energetically with the spin spiral state. We discuss how our results may help to interpret past and future measurements.</p>

            <h2>Perfect supercurrent diode efficiency in chiral nanotube-based Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph J. Cuozzo, François Léonard</p>
            <p>The supercurrent diode effect (SDE) describes superconducting systems where the magnitude of the superconducting-to-normal state switching current differs for positive and negative current bias. Despite the ubiquity of such diode effects in Josephson devices, the fundamental conditions to observe a diode effect in a Josephson junction and achieve perfect diode efficiency remain unclear. In this work, we analyze the supercurrent diode properties of a chiral nanotube-based Josephson junction within a Ginzburg-Landau theory. We find a diode effect and anomalous phase develops across the junction when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the tube despite the absence of spin-orbit interactions in the system. Unexpectedly, the SDE in the junction is independent of the anomalous phase. Alternatively, we determine a non-reciprocal persistent current that is protected by fluxoid quantization can activate SDE, even in the absence of higher-order pair tunneling processes. We show this new type of SDE can lead to, in principle, a perfect diode efficiency, highlighting how persistent currents can be used to engineer high efficiency supercurrent diodes.</p>

We also confirm that by varying the gate voltage between the quantum dots, it is possible to control the interdot spacing. Additionally, we observe a tunneling phenomenon called a quantum cellular automata effect, where multiple electrons move simultaneously, which is not seen in single or double quantum dots, due to Coulomb interactions. Our results demonstrate that ZnO nanostructures have reached a level where they can function as controllable multiple quantum dot systems.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional crystals and their heterostructures unlock access to a class of photonic devices, bringing nanophotonics from the nanometer scale down to the atomic level where quantum effects are relevant. Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are central in quantum photonics as quantum markers linked to their electrostatic, thermal, magnetic, or dielectric environment. This aspect is exciting in two-dimensional (2D) crystals and their heterostructures, where the environment can be abruptly modified through vertical stacking or lateral structuring, such as moiré or nano-patterned gates. To further develop 2D-based quantum photonic devices, there is a need for quantum markers that are capable of integration into various device geometries, and that can be read out individually, non-destructively, and without additional electrodes. Here, we show how to optically detect charge carrier accumulation using sub-GHz linewidth single-photon emitters coupled to a graphene device. We employ the single molecule Stark effect, sensitive to the electric fields generated by charge puddles, such as those at the graphene edge. The same approach enables dynamic sensing of electronic noise, and we demonstrate the optical read-out of low-frequency white noise in a biased graphene device. The approach described here can be further exploited to explore charge dynamics in 2D heterostructures using quantum emitter markers.</p>

            <p>Optical beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM) have numerous potential applications, but the means used for their generation often lack crucial on-demand control. In this work, we present a mechanism of converting spin angular momentum (SAM) to OAM in a non-structured beam. The conversion occurs through spin-orbit coupling in a reconfigurable photonic honeycomb lattice with staggering implemented by electromagnetically-induced transparency in an atomic vapor cell. The spin-orbit coupling allows to outcouple the OAM signal from a particular band in a given valley determined by the chirality of light or the lattice staggering, providing a non-zero Berry curvature for generating OAM. The dependence of the output OAM on the chirality of the input beam is the first control knob. The staggering works as a second control knob, flipping the sign of OAM for the fixed chirality. The demonstrated conversion between SAM and OAM is important for optical communications. Our results can be extended to other implementations of paraxial photonic graphene.</p>

Our considerations focus on the transport of noninteracting electrons at low temperatures. A possible connection with the phenomenon of chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is pointed out in one of the systems considered.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum geometry of rhombohedral graphite/graphene (RG) surface electronic states and its effects on superconductivity. We find that the RG surface bands have a non-vanishing quantum metric at the center of the drumhead region, and the local inequality between quantum metric and Berry curvature is an equality. Therefore, their quantum geometry is analogous to the lowest Landau level (LLL). The superconducting order parameters on the two surface orbitals of RG can be polarized by the surface potential, which boosts the superconducting transition in trilayer RG triggered by the displacement field. Analyzing the superfluid properties of multilayer RG, we make a connection with the topological heavy fermion model suggested to describe magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). It shows that RG fits in an unusual heavy-fermion picture with the flattest part of the surface bands carrying a nonzero supercurrent. These results may constrain the models constructed for the correlated phases of RG.</p>

Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</p>

Numerous methods exist to mitigate charge noise, including improving device fabrication, dynamical decoupling, and real-time parameter estimation. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of techniques to mitigate charge noise in semiconductor quantum dots by controlling the noise sources themselves. Using two different classical feedback methods, we stabilize an individual charged two-level fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot by exploiting sensitive gate-voltage dependence of the switching times. These control methods reduce the low-frequency component of the noise power spectrum by an order of magnitude. These techniques also enable stabilizing the fluctuator in either of its states.

            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) -- the nonreciprocity of the critical current in a bulk superconductor -- has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in superconducting electronics. However, the role of disorder scattering in SDE has rarely been considered, despite its potential qualitative impact, as we demonstrate in this work. We investigate SDE in a disordered Rashba superconductor under an in-plane magnetic field, employing a self-consistent Born approximation to derive the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis reveals two surprising effects. First, in the weak Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) regime, disorder can reverse the direction of the diode effect, indicated by a sign change in the superconducting diode efficiency coefficient. Second, in the strong Rashba SOC regime, disorder becomes the driving mechanism of SDE, which vanishes in its absence. In this case, we show that disorder-induced mixing of singlet and triplet superconducting orders underlies the effect.</p>

            <h2>Predicting the Néel temperatures in general helimagnetic materials: a comparison between mean field theory, random phase approximation, renormalized spin wave theory and classical Monte Carlo simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Varun Rajeev Pavizhakumari, Thomas Olsen</p>
            <p>The critical temperature for magnetic order comprises a crucial property of any magnetic material and ranges from a few Kelvin in certain antiferromagnets to 1400 K in ferromagnetic Co. However, the prediction of critical temperatures based on, for example, a spin wave dispersion is in general non-trivial. For ferromagnets and simple collinear antiferromagnets, estimates may be obtained from the Heisenberg model using either renormalized spin wave theory or the Green's function random phase approximation (RPA), but a systematic assessment of the accuracy of such approaches seems to be lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose generalizations of both renormalized spin wave theory and RPA to calculate the critical temperatures of single-$Q$ helimagnetic ground states, which include ferromagnets and antiferromagnets as special cases. We compare the methods to classical Monte Carlo simulations and Mean field theory, using experimental exchange parameters for a wide range of materials; MnO and NiO (single site Néel ground states), MnF$_2$ (altermagnet), Cr$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_2$O$_3$ (two site Néel states) and Ba$_3$NbFe$_3$Si$_2$O$_{14}$ (incommensurate helimagnet). In all cases, we observe that predictions from RPA are in excellent agreement with experimental values and RPA thus constitutes a rather reliable all-purpose method for calculating critical temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Understanding entropy production via a thermal zero-player game</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehmet Süzen</p>
            <p>A new thermal bath scheme for Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg) is introduced. New game moves in sampling the given temperature is achieved via Monte Carlo dynamics of both Metropolis and Glauber as a stochastic game. This kind of approach makes the game an ideal tool for demonstrating thermal dependency of entropy production in a novel way. Using this new approach, Ising-Conway Entropy game's rate of entropy production depending on different temperatures are explored. Thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and plausible test bed for studying complex dynamical systems in classical statistical mechanics, that is conceptually simple, pedagogically accessible, yet realistic.</p>

            <h2>Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovic Gardré, Swen Helstroffer, Pierre Muller, Fabrice Thalmann, Thierry Charitat, Laurent Joly, Claire Loison</p>
            <p>Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity as the system enters the attractive regime, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovic Jami, François-Xavier Gauci, Céline Cohen, Xavier Noblin, Ludovic Keiser</p>
            <p>Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem - where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure - we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales - the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$ - governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When these two timescales are comparable, we uncover previously unreported nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim</p>
            <p>A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ferdinand Grueneis</p>
            <p>When the rate of shot noise is controlled by on-off states we speak of intermittent shot noise. The on-off states lead to alternately occurring clusters of events and intermissions, respectively. We derive the power spectrum of the intermittent shot noise by applying the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. Besides reduced shot noise, we obtain excess noise, which depends on the parameters of the on-off states. We calculate the excess noise for power-law distributed on-states; within the scaling region, the excess noise is excellently approximated by C/f^b. The behavior of the slope b and of the amplitude C in dependence of the on-off times is investigated. For large scaling regions we find a preference for a pure 1/f shape. Finally, we regard the variance of events occurring within a time interval. In the presence of 1/f fluctuations, the variance of counts attains extreme values which are accompanied by an extreme property of slope b.</p>

            <p>Employing two synchronized mode-locked femtosecond lasers and interferometric detection of the pump-probe spectra -- referred to as asynchronous and interferometric transient absorption (AI-TA) -- we have developed a method for broad dynamic range and rapid data acquisition. Using AI-TA, we examined photochemical changes during femtosecond pump-probe experiments on all-inorganic cesium lead halide nanomaterials, including perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) and nanoplatelets (PeNPLs). The laser pulse train facilitates photoreactions while allowing real-time observation of charge carrier dynamics. In PeNCs undergoing halide anion photo-substitution, transient absorption spectra showed increasing bandgap energy and faster relaxation dynamics as the Cl/Br ratio increased. For colloidal PeNPLs, continuous observation revealed both spectral and kinetic changes during the light-induced coalescence of nanoplatelets, by analyzing temporal segments. This integrated technique not only deepens understanding of exciton dynamics and environmental influences in perovskite nanomaterials but also establishes AI-TA as a transformative tool for real-time observation of photochemical dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum processing units (QPUs) based on superconducting Josephson junctions promise significant advances in quantum computing. However, they face critical challenges. Decoherence, scalability limitations, and error correction overhead hinder practical, fault-tolerant implementations. This paper investigates these issues by exploring both fundamental quantum phenomena and practical engineering challenges. We analyze key quantum mechanical principles such as superposition, entanglement, and decoherence that govern the behavior of superconducting qubits. We also discuss quantum tunneling, Cooper pair formation, and the operational mechanics of Josephson junctions in detail. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis with alternative architectures, including ion trap and photonic systems. This comparison highlights the unique advantages and trade-offs of Josephson junction-based QPUs. Our findings emphasize the critical role of material innovations and optimized control techniques. These advances are essential for mitigating noise and decoherence and for realizing robust, scalable quantum computing.</p>

            <p>There exist several initiatives worldwide to deploy quantum key distribution (QKD) over existing fibre networks and achieve quantum-safe security at large scales. To understand the overall QKD network performance, it is required to transition from the analysis of individual links, as done so far, to the characterization of the network as a whole. In this work, we undertake this study by embedding QKD protocols on complex networks, which correctly model the existing fiber networks. We focus on networks with trusted nodes and on continuous-variable (CV) schemes, which have much higher key rates than their discrete-variable (DV) counterparts. In the effective CV network, however, many of the unique properties of complex networks, such as small-worldness and the presence of hubs, are lost due to the fast decay of the key rate with physical distance for CV systems. These properties can be restored when considering a hybrid network consisting of both CV and DV protocols, achieving at the same time high average rate and inter-connectivity. Our work opens the path to the study of QKD complex networks in existing infrastructures.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Diffusional Hydrogen Escape in High-$T_c$ Superconducting Calcium Superhydride at Megabar Pressures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xixi Jia, Haoran Chen, Xiaoqiu Ye, Jian Lv, Xitian Zhang, Hui Wang, Yansun Yao</p>
            <p>High-pressure metal superhydrides have attracted intense scientific interest due to their remarkable superconducting properties. While superconductivity is known to be sensitive to material composition, compositional variability is often overlooked in metal superhydrides at megabar pressures. Using ab initio path-integral simulations, we find that up to 7 % of the hydrogen atoms escape from the 215-kelvin superconducting CaH$_6$ upon decompression from 165 to 123 GPa. This loss of hydrogen leads to an elastic instability at low pressures, an "abnormal" positive pressure dependence of the superconducting $T_c$ and a quantum phase transition from a mixed superconducting-diffusive state to a pure superconducting phase. In this mixed phase, proton diffusivity reaches $10^{-8}$ $\mathrm{cm^2/s}$ at low temperatures and promotes to $10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{cm^2/s}$ at room temperature, which elucidates the escape of hydrogen at megabar pressures. Our results are consistent with many "anomalous" experimental observations and highlight the significance of composition effects in high-$T_c$ metal superhydrides.</p>

            <p>The unexpected discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in layered van der Waals materials has sparked interest in both their fundamental properties and their potential for novel applications. Recent studies suggest near room-temperature ferromagnetism in the pressurized van der Waals crystal CrGeTe$_3$. We perform a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of magnetism and electronic correlations in CrGeTe$_3$, combining broad-frequency reflectivity measurements with density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. Our experimental optical conductivity spectra trace the signatures of developing ferromagnetic order and of the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) as a function of temperature and hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, we observe the emergence of a mid-infrared feature in the optical conductivity, indicating the development of strong orbital-selective correlations in the high-pressure ferromagnetic phase. We find a distinct relationship between the plasma frequency and Curie temperature of CrGeTe$_3$, which strongly suggests that a double-exchange mechanism is responsible for the observed near room-temperature ferromagnetism. Our results clearly demonstrate the existence of a charge-transfer gap in the metallic phase, ruling out its previously conjectured collapse under pressure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayak Bhowmik, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in our system where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the presence of finite Cooper pair momentum of the FFLO ground state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the superconducting diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p>The topological crystalline insulator SnTe exhibits two types of surface Dirac cones: one located at non-time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (001) and (110) surfaces, and the other at time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (111) surface. Motivated by the recent experimental evidence of Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) and their hybridization on the (001) surface [Nature 633, 71 (2024)], we present a comprehensive investigation of Majorana vortex phases in SnTe, including topological classification, surface-state Hamiltonians analysis, and lattice model calculations. By utilizing rotational and magnetic mirror symmetries, we present two equivalent methods to reveal the topology of Majorana phases on different surfaces. We find that the MVEMs on the (001) and (110) surfaces are protected by both magnetic group and rotational symmetries. In contrast, the MVEMs on the (111) surface are protected by magnetic group or particle-hole symmetry. Due to the different properties of Dirac fermions in the $\bar{\Gamma}$ and $\bar{M}$ valleys on the (111) surfaces, including Fermi velocities and energy levels, we find that abundant vortex phase transitions can occur for the [111]-direction vortex. As the chemical potential increases, the number of robust MVEMs can change from $0\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 2$. These vortex transitions are characterized by both $Z$ winding number and $Z_2$ pfaffian topological invariants.</p>

            <p>The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.</p>

Analyses of the spectra confirm a strong influence of many-body effects, and reveal that excited-state zero-quantum coherences between direct and indirect excitons in the quantum wells dephase faster than the much higher-energy single-quantum coherences between excitonic excited states and ground states. The results also suggest an important energy-dependent role of continuum states in mediating system dynamics, and they indicate that dephasing mechanisms are associated with uncorrelated or anticorrelated energy-level fluctuations.</p>

Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.</p>

            <p>We developed a hydrodynamic model of plasmonic crystals formed in the current-driven grating gate transistor structures. The model demonstrates that the quality factor of plasmonic resonances could be increased by using ungated regions with high electron densities connecting multiple plasmonic cavities. The analytical and numerical calculations of the EM radiation absorption by the band plasmons show that the drive current makes all plasma modes optically active by breaking the symmetry of the plasma oscillations. This effect results in splitting plasmon resonant absorption peaks revealing the gaps in the plasmonic band spectrum tunable by current. The analyzed design could achieve resonant behavior at room temperature for plasmonic crystals implemented in various material systems, including graphene, III-V, III-N materials, and p-diamond. We argue that the resulting double-peak spectrum line in the terahertz range also facilitates the absorption at the gap frequency, typically in microwave range. Power pumping at the gap frequency enables excitation of the gap plasmons, promoting frequency conversion from microwave to THz ranges. The flexibility in the length of the ungated region for the investigated structures allows for an effective coupling with THz radiation, with the metal grating acting as a distributive resonant antenna. The applications of the presented results extend to THz communication systems, THz sensing and imaging, frequency conversion systems, and other advanced THz plasmonic devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators are characterized by vanishing longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance in the absence of an external magnetic field. Among them, high-Chern-number QAH insulators offer multiple nondissipative current channels, making them crucial for the development of low-power-consumption electronics. Using first-principles calculations, we propose that high-Chern-number ($C>1$) QAH insulators can be realized in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) multilayer films through the combination of mixed stacking orders, eliminating the need for additional buffer layers. The underlying physical mechanism is validated by calculating real-space-resolved anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). Local AHC is found to be predominantly located in regions with consecutive correct stacking orders, contributing to quasi-quantized AHC. Conversely, regions with consecutive incorrect stacking contribute minimally to the total AHC, which can be attributed to the varied interlayer coupling in different stacking configurations. Our work provides valuable insights into the design principle for achieving large Chern numbers, and highlights the role of stacking configurations in manipulating electronic and topological properties in MBT films and its derivatives.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity up to 17 K in the high-pressure rhombohedral-I phase of ReO3: a potential oxide analogy of hydride superconductors</h2>

            <p>As an A-site-vacant perovskite-type oxide, ReO3 undergoes sequential pressure-driven structural transitions associated with the rotation of ReO6 octahedra. The rhombohedral-I phase in the pressure range of 12-39 GPa is featured by a lattice of nearly close-packed oxygen layers intercalated with Re cations, in reminiscent of the recently discovered superhydride superconductors. A combined study of first-principles calculations and transport measurements under high pressures enabled us to discover superconductivity in the rhombohedral-I phase, and it shows a dome-shaped Tc(P) with a maximum Tc of 17 K at about 30 GPa. In addition to the enhanced density of states at Fermi level compared to that of the ambient phase, the vibrations of hexagonal-close-packed oxygen lattice significantly strengthen the electron-phonon coupling, which is responsible for observed superconductivity with a relatively high Tc. The present work thus establishes a rare case among oxide superconductors that the light-element oxygen lattice plays a crucial role in inducing superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Spin gapped metals: A novel class of materials for multifunctional spintronic devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Sasioglu, M. Tas, S. Ghosh, W. Beida, B. Sanyal S. Blugel, I. Mertig, I. Galanakis</p>
            <p>Gapped metals, a recently proposed class of materials, possess a band gap slightly above or below the Fermi level, behaving as intrinsic p- or n-type semiconductors without requiring external doping. Inspired by this concept, we propose a novel material class: "spin gapped metals". These materials exhibit intrinsic p- or n-type character independently for each spin channel, similar to dilute magnetic semiconductors but without the need for transition metal doping. A key advantage of spin gapped metals lies in the absence of band tails that exist within the band gap of conventional p- and n-type semiconductors. Band tails degrade the performance of devices like tunnel field-effect transistors (causing high subthreshold slopes) and negative differential resistance tunnel diodes (resulting in low peak-to-valley current ratios). Here, we demonstrate the viability of spin gapped metals using first-principles electronic band structure calculations on half-Heusler compounds. Our analysis reveals compounds displaying both gapped metal and spin gapped metal behavior, paving the way for next-generation multifunctional devices in spintronics and nanoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>Energy Dispersion, Superconductivity and Magnetic Fluctuations in Stacked Altermagnetism Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Chang, Hantao Lu, Jize Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Yang Ding</p>
            <p>Recently, altermagnetism (AM) has emerged as a new category of magnetism, alongside conventional antiferromagnetism (AFM) and ferromagnetism (FM). In an AM, superconductivity (SC) is faced with a dilemma that the spin-polarized bands, induced by the broken time reversal (T ) symmetry, dominantly supports spin-triplet pairing. In contrast, AM spin fluctuations routinely facilitate spin-singlet pairing as in AFM. Consequently, unconventional SC is either absent or weak in AM materials. Here, we propose that stacking 2D AM materials could resolve this dilemma. Stacked 2D materials have yielded a variety of new electronic properties by altering the symmetries inherent in the monolayer. In a 2D anisotropic Hubbard model, we investigate the general energy dispersions of both single-layer and stacked AM materials. We demonstrate that AM sheet stacking can alter the original symmetries, consequently affecting the energy dispersion. The interlayer magnetic coupling enhances the low q magnetic fluctuations. T symmetry is restored in the AA stacking with an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, and then both the energy dispersion and pairing interaction are in favor of spin-singlet SC. The ferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the AB stacking not only recovers T symmetry but also supports spin-triplet pairing. It is further anticipated that twisted bilayer AM sheets could exhibit additional novel electronic properties, including topology, flat bands, and collective excitations. Our work illustrates that stacking sheets of AM materials could open up a unique research domain in exploring novel quantum phenomena and offer a fertile ground for potential electronic applications.</p>

            <p>FAPbI$_3$ is a material of interest for its potential in solar cell applications, driven by its remarkable optoelectronic properties. However, the low-temperature phase of FAPbI$_3$ remains poorly understood, with open questions surrounding its crystal structure, octahedral tilting, and the arrangement of formamidinium (FA) cations. Using our trained machine-learned potential in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a detailed investigation of this phase, uncovering its structural characteristics and dynamical behavior. Our analysis reveals the octahedral tilt pattern and sheds light on the rotational dynamics of FA cations in the low temperature phase. Strikingly, we find that the FA cations become frozen in a metastable configuration, unable to reach the thermodynamic ground state. By comparing our simulated results with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra, we demonstrate good agreement, further validating our findings. This phenomenon mirrors experimental observations and offers a compelling explanation for the experimental challenges in accessing the true ground state. These findings provide critical insights into the fundamental physics of FAPbI$_3$ and its low-temperature behavior, advancing our understanding of this technologically important material.</p>

            <p>Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. Additionally, we report measurements of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of two Nb SRF cavities processed using distinct methods. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.</p>

            <h2>Probing electronic transitions and defect-induced Urbach tail bands in functional perovskite oxides using diffuse reflectance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramachandran Balakrishnan, Priyambada Sahoo, Balamurugan Karuppannan, Ambesh Dixit</p>
            <p>We conducted a detailed study of electronic transitions and defects induced Urbach tail bands in various functional perovskite oxides (V2O5, BaSnO3, PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3, BiMnO3, and BiFeO3) using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). We analyzed their DRS spectra using the Kubelka-Munk (KM) function, the Tauc plot, and the first derivative of the reflectance for a comparative study. BiMnO3 exhibits an electronic transition with indirect band gap energy, Eg = 0.92 eV. In contrast, all other functional perovskite oxides, namely bulk V2O5, BaSnO3, PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3, and BiFeO3, show direct band gap interband transitions, with Eg values of 2.27, 3.25, 3.10, and 2.48 eV, respectively. The estimated Urbach energy (EU) values related to the induced defects in these direct band gap functional oxides are approximately 0.24, 0.38, 0.25, and 0.48 eV, respectively. Moreover, a reduction in the band gap energy of multiferroic BiFeO3 was observed due to induced chemical pressure from (Ba, Ca) doping and a decrease in particle size. Importantly, the evaluated band gap and Urbach energies of the functional perovskite oxide materials obtained from the analyses of the first derivative of reflectance and the Tauc plot method align remarkably well with the values deduced using the Kubelka-Munk function theory. Effectively, we propose a comprehensive electronic band structure for the multiferroic BiFeO3, an important material for optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaic, photocatalytic, and photoferroelectric devices.</p>

            <p>Monoclinic bismuth vanadate (m-BiVO$_4$) is a promising indirect band gap semiconductor for photoelectrochemical water splitting, yet the characteristics of its low-lying photoexcitations, or excitons, remain poorly understood. Here, we use an ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation approach that incorporates phonon screening to compute the nature and lifetimes of the low-lying excitons of m-BiVO$_4$. Our calculations indicate that at 0 K, the lowest-lying exciton energy exceeds the indirect band gap, enabling spontaneous dissociation into free carriers via phonon emission within picoseconds. At 300 K, both phonon emission and absorption effects reduce this timescale to only a few femtoseconds. Phonon screening also greatly reduces the binding energy of the lowest-lying exciton, leading to an optical absorption spectrum that better reproduces experimental measurements. Overall, our findings establish the general conditions under which phonon emission-driven exciton dissociation can occur in indirect gap semiconductors, and they emphasize the critical role phonon screening can play in predictive calculations of photophysical properties of complex materials.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Generation of Higher-order Spin-Orbit Couplings, Topology and Persistent Spin Texture in Light-Irradiated Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Qiang Li</p>
            <p>Altermagnets have been identified as the third category of magnetic materials, exhibiting momentum-dependent spin splitting characterized by even powers of momentum. In this study, we show that when subjected to elliptically polarized light, these materials serve as an exemplary framework for the dynamic generation of topological bands featuring higher-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Notably, while the generated Zeeman field remains invariant to the particular altermagnetic ordering, the induced higher-order SOCs are related to the magnitude and symmetry of the altermagnetic order. Specifically, we show that an altermagnet exhibiting $k^n$-spin splitting can generate spin-orbit couplings up to $k^{n-1}$. In the limit of circularly polarized light, the only correction is $k^{n-1}$, with all lower-order contributions being nullified. Interestingly, light-induced SOCs significantly impact the low-energy band topology, where their Chern numbers change by $\Delta C =\pm 1,2,3$ for $d,g,f$-wave altermagnets. Finally, we find a critical field in which a persistent spin texture is realized, a highly desirable state with predicted infinite spin lifetime. Our work showcases light as a powerful, controllable tool for engineering complex and exciting phenomena in altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials exhibiting ferromagnetic-like spin-split bands and antiferromagnetic-like compensated magnetic order, have attracted significant interest for next-generation spintronic applications. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has emerged as a promising altermagnetic candidate due to its compensated antiparallel magnetic order and strong spin-split electronic bands. However, recent experimental and theoretical reports also suggest that RuO2 may be non-magnetic in its ground state, underscoring the need for deeper investigations into its magnetic character. Specifically, the (100)-oriented RuO2 films are expected to generate spin currents with transverse spin polarization parallel to the Néel vector. Here, we investigate magnetotransport in epitaxial RuO2/Permalloy (Py) heterostructures to examine spin Hall magnetoresistance and interfacial effects generated in such systems. Our measurements reveal a pronounced negative angular-dependent magnetoresistance for variation of magnetic field direction perpendicular to the charge current direction. Detailed temperature-, magnetic field-, and crystallographic orientation-dependent measurements indicate that interface-generated spin current (IGSC) at the RuO2/Py interface predominantly governs the observed magnetoresistance. This shows that strong interface effects dominate over possible altermagnetic contributions from RuO2. Our results show that the role of interface-generated spin currents is crucial and should not be overlooked in studies of altermagnetic systems. A critical step in this direction is disentangling interfacial from altermagnetic contributions. The insight into interfacial contributions from altermagnetic influences is essential for the advancement of RuO2 based spintronic memory and sensing applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Magno O. Pereira, Denise Assafrão, Frankbelson dos S. Azevedo, A. G. de Lima, Cleverson Filgueiras, Edilberto O. Silva</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the photoionization cross-section of an electron confined in a quantum dot, considering the position-dependent variation of the effective mass through the parameter $\gamma$. We used a theoretical model based on the Schrödinger equation, in which $\gamma$ influences the energy levels and wave functions through an effective potential obtained from the harmonic oscillator potential - which, in the limit $\gamma = 0$, reduces to the original harmonic oscillator potential. Furthermore, we compared the modifications in the photoionization cross-section of these quantum systems with the constant-mass case. Our results demonstrate that even a small variation in $\gamma$ significantly impacts the photoionization process's amplitude and peak position. We also found that for specific values of $\gamma$, an inversion occurs: The amplitude, which initially increases as the quantum dot absorbs the photon, begins to decrease. Additionally, we observed that the optical transitions involving the ground state restrict the admissible values of $\gamma$ to negative values only. These results may have relevant implications for designing optoelectronic devices based on quantum dots with adjustable mass properties.</p>

            <h2>Chemical Pressure Tuning of Multipolar and Magnetic Orders in Ba$_2$(Cd$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$)ReO$_6$ Double Perovskites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koki Shibuya, Daigorou Hirai, Koshi Takenaka</p>
            <p>Double perovskite compounds containing 5d transition metal elements have been extensively studied as platforms for multipolar order phenomena stemming from spin-orbit-entangled 5d electrons. In this study, we examine the interplay between crystal structure, multipolar order, and magnetic order in solid solutions of double perovskites with the 5d1 electronic configuration: Ba2CdReO6 and Ba2CaReO6, which exhibit distinct electronic orders. The substitution of larger Ca2+ ions for Cd2+ in Ba2CdReO6, systematically increases the lattice constant with increasing the amount of substitution x. Although the spin-orbit-entangled J = 3/2 state remains intact upon substitution, both the quadrupolar order below Tq = 25 K and the canted antiferro-magnetic (AFM) order below Tm = 12 K in Ba2CdReO6 are progressively suppressed as x increases. Magnetization measurements reveal that the canted AFM order is suppressed at x = 0.6, transitioning to a colinear AFM order, while the quadrupolar order persists up to x = 0.9. The experimental electronic phase diagram, summarizing the dependence of electronic orders on lattice constants, aligns well with the theoretical phase diagram considering electric quadrupolar interactions [G. Chen et al., Phys. Rev. B 82, 174440 (2010)]. This correspondence confirms that chemical pressure induced by substitution effectively tunes the interaction between 5d electrons. The results highlight the potential of chemical pressure to modulate multipolar interactions, paving the way for novel multipolar properties in 5d electron systems.</p>

Our results show that only spin currents polarized normally to the strip plane guarantee a quick and steady rigid flow of 180DWs, thus realize a fast reversal of Néel vectors in antiferromagnets (AFMs). Different from the common ``current-in-plane'' geometry which is feasible only for metallic AFMs, our ``current-out-of-plane'' layout under investigation can further apply to insulating AFMs (which are more common in real applications) via quantum tunneling effect. Results from this work paves the way for fine control of Néel vectors in (both metallic and insulating) AFM strips and further development of novel magnetic nanodevices based on them.</p>

            <p>Advancing quantum information and communication technology (qICT) requires smaller and faster components with actively controllable functionalities. This work presents a novel strategy for dynamically modulating magnetic properties via proximity effects controlled by light. We demonstrate this concept using hybrid nanoscale systems composed of C60 molecules proximitized to a cobalt metallic ferromagnetic surface, where proximity interactions are particularly strong. Our findings show that by inducing excitons in the C60 molecules with resonant ultrashort light pulses, we can significantly modify the interaction at the cobalt/C60 interface, leading to a striking 60% transient shift in the frequency of the dipolar ferromagnetic resonance mode of the Cobalt. This effect, detected via a specifically designed time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (tr-MOKE) experiment, persists on a timescale of hundreds of picoseconds. Since this frequency shift directly correlates with a transient change in the anisotropy field (an essential parameter for technological applications) our findings establish a new paradigm for ultrafast optical control of magnetism at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets (AMs) are an exotic class of antiferromagnet that exhibit spin-splitting even at the absence of net global magnetization and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. In this work, we investigated theoretically, the supercurrent nonreciprocity in an Ising Superconductor/Altermagnet/Ising Superconductor (ISC/AM/ISC) Josephson junction which revealed asymmetric Josephson critical currents, $0 - \pi$ transitions and anomalous current-phase relationship (CPR). A strong Josephson diode efficiency (JDE) is observed due to the combined effects of AM strength and orientations in a conventional SC even in absence of SOC. However, it significantly enhances in presence of intrinsic SOC (ISOC), resulting in pronounced diode effect in both single and double band ISC/AM based Josephson junction. Additionally, it is observed that JDE is more prominent at higher AM strengths with intermediate orientations in all scenario. Notably, it is significantly suppressed for orientations $0^\circ$ and $45^\circ$. Our results also indicate that barrier transparency and AM lengths play a crucial role in optimizing the JDE. In a single-band ISC/AM system JDE persists for any AM length, while reduces at longer AM junction in case of a double-band ISC/AM system. Moreover, our results suggest that a diode efficiency of $\sim 52\%$ can be achieved in the proposed Josephson junction in both single and double band ISC/AM Josephson junction by considering strong AM strength. Furthermore, single band ISC offers wide AM orientation range in contrast to double band ISC for better tunability and optimization of JDE. Our findings highlight the impact of AM strength, orientation and ISOC on the JDE efficiency offering insights for superconducting diode design.</p>

            <p>Utilizing ab initio simulations, we study the spin-dependent electronic transport characteristics within Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$-based van der Waals heterostructures. The electronic density of states for both free-standing and device-configured Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ (F4GT) confirms its ferromagnetic metallic nature and reveals a weak interface interaction between F4GT and PtTe$_2$ electrodes, enabling efficient spin filtering. We observe a decrease in the magnetic anisotropy energy of F4GT in the device configuration, indicating reduced stability of magnetic moments and heightened sensitivity to external conditions. The transmission eigenstates of PtTe$_2$/ monolayer F4GT/PtTe$_2$ heterostructures demonstrate interference patterns affected by relative phases and localization, notably different in the spin-up and spin-down channels. The ballistic transport through a double-layer F4GT with a ferromagnetic configuration sandwiched between two PtTe$_2$ electrodes is predicted to exhibit an impressive spin polarization of 97$\%$ with spin-up electrons exhibiting higher transmission probability than spin-down electrons. Moreover, we investigate the spin transport properties of Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$/GaTe/Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructures sandwiched between PtTe$_2$ electrodes to explore their potential as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in spintronic devices. The inclusion of GaTe as a 2D semiconducting spacer between F4GT layers results in a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of 487$\%$ at low bias and decreases with increasing bias voltage. In general, our findings underscore the potential of F4GT / GaTe / F4GT heterostructures to advance spintronic devices based on van der Waals materials.</p>

            <p>The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.</p>

However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) remains an open question. We report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets (AF) up to frequencies of 24 GHz. We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AF. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>A multiferroic state with both electric polarization ($P$) and magnetization ($M$) shows the inherently strong $P$-$M$ coupling, when $P$ is induced by cycloidal (Néel-wall like) spin modulation. The sign of $P$ is determined by clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, we report the current-induced magnetoelectric control of the multiferroics in a helimagnetic metal YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment $T \sim P \times M \sim (\hat{q} \times \chi_v) \times M$ as well as with the magneto-chirality $\chi_v \times M$, where $\hat{q}$ and $\chi_v$ being the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. We furthermore observe an enhancement of NRR by the spin-cluster scattering via $\chi_v$ and its fluctuation. These findings may pave a way to exploration of multiferroic conductors and application of the spin-helicity degree of freedom as a state-variable.</p>

We further show that, for a subwavelegnth lattice, the isolation ratio for the nonreciprocal transmission is determined solely by $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ instead of the extensively studied real part $\text{Re}(\mathbf{k})$. Our finding contradicts the common belief that "spectral nonreciprocity [$\omega(\mathbf{k})\neq\omega(-\mathbf{k})$] always implies nonreciprocal transmission".</p>

            <h2>Tunable effective diffusion of CO2 in aqueous foam</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cécile Aprili, Gwennou Coupier, Élise Lorenceau, Benjamin Dollet</p>
            <p>Aqueous foams are solid materials composed of gases and liquids, exhibiting a large gas/liquid surface area and enabling dynamic exchanges between their fluid components. The structure of binary-gas foams, whose bubbles consist of a mixture of two gases having different affinities with the liquid, thus offers real potential for the dynamic separation of these gases at low cost. In single-gas foams, the foam structure evolves under the effect of gas flow induced by Laplace pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble size. This leads to the well-documented Ostwald ripening. In addition to these capillary effects, the structure of binary-gas foams can evolve under the effect of gas flow induced by partial (or osmotic) pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble composition. We experimentally investigate the shrinking of CO$_2$-laden 2D foams exposed to air, observing a crust of tiny bubbles at the front. We derive a non-linear diffusion model for the gas in the foam and propose a description of the whole foam as an effective, homogeneous medium, the key parameter being the gas permeability ratio across the foam's soap films ($\neq 1$ for CO$_2/$air). The effective diffusivity of the gas in the foam emerges from the coupling between foam structure and gas transport across soap films. We extrapolate it for various permeability ratios and show that it can vary continuously between the diffusivity of the gas in the liquid and that of the gas in the atmosphere, enabling tunable gas retention and release by controlling the composition of the atmosphere.</p>

            <h2>Detection of anyon braiding through pump-probe spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu Yang, Ryan Buechele, Nandini Trivedi</p>
            <p>We show that the braiding of anyons in a quantum spin liquid leaves a distinct dynamical signature in the nonlinear pump-probe response. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and matrix product state techniques, we study the nonlinear pump-probe response of the toric code in a magnetic field, a model which hosts mobile electric $e$ and magnetic $m$ anyonic excitations. While the linear response signal oscillates and decays with time like $\sim t^{-1.3}$, the amplitude of the nonlinear signal for $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$ features a linear-in-time enhancement at early times. The comparison between $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$, which involves the non-trivial braiding of $e$ and $m$ anyons, and $\chi^{(3)}_{XXX}$ that involves the trivial braiding of the same types of anyons, serves to distinguish the braiding statistics of anyons. We support our analysis by constructing a hard-core anyon model with statistical gauge fields to develop further insights into the time dependence of the pump-probe response. Pump-probe spectroscopy provides a distinctive new probe of quantum spin liquid states, beyond the inconclusive broad features observed in single spin flip inelastic neutron scattering.</p>

            <h2>The Chirality of Phonons: Definitions, Symmetry Constraints, and Experimental Observation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuai Zhang, Zhiheng Huang, Muchen Du, Tianping Ying, Luojun Du, Tiantian Zhang</p>
            <p>Circularly polarized phonons with nonzero angular momentum (AM), also referred to as chiral phonons, have garnered increasing attention in recent studies. Many existing experimental/theoretical works identify chiral phonons based on pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) or the flipping of the polarization of the circularly polarized light (CPL) in the Raman scattering process. However, the accuracy and universality of these assumptions remain to be verified. Moreover, in condensed matter physics, symmetry strongly governs the scattering and interactions of phonons, quasi-particles, and external fields, profoundly affecting correlated physical phenomena. In this study, we first conduct an in-depth examination of the distinctions and interconnections among AM, PAM, helicity, and atomic motion--key characteristics inherent to chiral phonons--and then undertake a comprehensive study of phonon chirality, as well as their associated physical quantities, and experimental benchmarks under various magnetic point groups. By developing the symmetry-based framework for phonon chirality across magnetic point groups, we demonstrate that identifying chiral phonons solely through nonzero PAM or CPL polarization inversion is inadequate, challenging prior findings. This framework clarifies the relationship between symmetry and phonon chirality, revealing that phonon modes governed by different symmetries exhibit distinct experimental signatures, thereby advancing our understanding of these phenomena. Finally, experiments on five materials with distinct symmetries are conducted to validate our theoretical results. Supported by both theoretical rigor and experimental validation, our study represents a significant step forward in advancing research on symmetry-constrained phonons.</p>

            <h2>Unexpected collapse of edge reconstruction in compressible Quantum Hall fluid within filling fraction range 2/3 to 1</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suvankar Purkait, Tanmay Maiti, Pooja Agarwal, Suparna Sahoo, Giorgio Biasiol, Lucia Sorba, Biswajit Karmakar</p>
            <p>The edge structure of a gate-defined compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 is studied using the three reconstructed $e^2/3h$ fractional edge modes of unity filling integer quantum Hall state. We find that the individually excited partially resolved $e^2/3h$ edge modes of the bulk state equilibrate completely even at higher magnetic field when passing through the gate defined compressible fluid with filling between 2/3 and 1. This result is unexpected because edge reconstruction at the smooth boundary is generally expected due to dominant incompressibility at filling 2/3 and 1/3. Recently such reconstructed edge mode has been reported for the compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3. In contrary, equilibration of fractional edge modes in the compressible fluid within the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 becomes faster with increasing magnetic field. This anomalous results will stimulate further investigations on edge structure in these complex many body systems.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-assisted magnetization switching in a quantum spin-phonon chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Peter M. Oppeneer, James K. Freericks</p>
            <p>We propose a Néel magnetization switching mechanism in a hybrid magnon-phonon optical cavity system. A terahertz-pumped single-mode cavity photon couples to a spin-phonon chain, while the system dissipates energy via different baths. Our mean-field analysis reveals that the photon induces magnetization switching by generating strongly entangled magnon pairs with opposite momenta -- a feature weakly present in the cavity-free system. This switching occurs only at specific drive frequencies, namely at low magnon energies and near the upper edge (perpendicular modes) of the two-magnon band. Our results underscore the roles of laser fluence, damping, and photon loss in modulating the switching process, offering a promising route for cavity-assisted magnetization control in opto-spintronics.</p>

Huang, Subhasish Mandal, Shuolong Yang</p>
            <p>A topological superconductor, characterized by either a chiral order parameter or a chiral topological surface state in proximity to bulk superconductivity, is foundational to topological quantum computing. As in other topological phases of matter, electronic correlations can tune topological superconductivity via modifications of the low-energy Fermiology. Such tuning has not been realized so far. Here we uncover a unique topological superconducting phase in competition with electronic correlations in 10-unit-cell thick FeTe$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ films grown on SrTiO$_{3}$ substrates. When the Te content $x$ exceeds $0.7$, we observe a rapid increase of the effective mass for the Fe $d_{xy}$ band, with the emergence of a superconducting topological surface state confirmed by high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy; however, near the FeTe limit, the system enters an incoherent regime where the topological surface state becomes unidentifiable and superconductivity is suppressed. Theory suggests that the electron-electron interactions in the odd-parity $xy^-$ band with a strong $d_{xy}$ character lead to an orbital-selective correlated phase. Our work establishes FeTe$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ thin films as a unique platform where electronic correlations sensitively modulate topological superconductivity, suggesting opportunities to use tunable electron-electron interactions to engineer new topological phases in a broad class of materials.</p>

Molas</p>
            <p>Monolayers (MLs) of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (\mbox{S-TMDs}) emit light very efficiently and display rich spin-valley physics, with gyromagnetic ($g$-) factors of about -4. Here, we investigate how these properties can be tailored by alloying. Magneto-optical spectroscopy is used to reveal the peculiar properties of excitonic complexes in Mo$_{x}$W$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ MLs with different Mo and W concentrations. We show that the alloys feature extremely high $g$-factors for neutral excitons, that change gradually with the composition up to reaching values of the order of -10 for $x \approx 0.2$. First-principles calculations corroborate the experimental findings and provide evidence that alloying in S-TMDs results in a non-trivial band structure engineering, being at the origin of the high $g$-factors. The theoretical framework also suggests a higher strain sensitivity of the alloys, making them promising candidates for tailor-made optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>A multiferroic state with both electric polarization ($P$) and magnetization ($M$) shows the inherently strong $P$-$M$ coupling, when $P$ is induced by cycloidal (Néel-wall like) spin modulation. The sign of $P$ is determined by clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, we report the current-induced magnetoelectric control of the multiferroics in a helimagnetic metal YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment $T \sim P \times M \sim (\hat{q} \times \chi_v) \times M$ as well as with the magneto-chirality $\chi_v \times M$, where $\hat{q}$ and $\chi_v$ being the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. We furthermore observe an enhancement of NRR by the spin-cluster scattering via $\chi_v$ and its fluctuation. These findings may pave a way to exploration of multiferroic conductors and application of the spin-helicity degree of freedom as a state-variable.</p>

            <p>Magnonics is an emerging field widely considered as a paradigm shift in information technology that uses spin waves for data storage, processing and transmission. However, the coherent control of spin waves in 2D magnets still remains a challenge. Herein, we investigate the interplay between molecular spins and magnons in hybrid heterostructures formed by [CpTi(cot)] and VOPc spin qubits deposited on the surface of the air-stable 2D van der Waals ferromagnet CrSBr using first principles. Our results show that different molecular rotation configurations significantly impact on qubit relaxation time and alter the magnon spectra of the underlying 2D magnet, allowing the chemical coherent control of spin waves in this material. We predict the feasibility of an ultrafast magnon-qubit interface with minimized decoherence, where exchange coupling plays a crucial role. This work opens new avenues for hybrid quantum magnonics, enabling selective tailoring through a versatile chemical approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Argüello-Luengo, Alejandro González-Tudela, J. Ignacio Cirac</p>
            <p>Here, we propose a platform based on ultra-cold fermionic molecules trapped in optical lattices to simulate nonadiabatic effects as they appear in certain molecular dynamical problems. The idea consists in a judicious choice of two rotational states as the simulated electronic or nuclear degrees of freedom, in which their dipolar interactions induce the required attractive or repulsive interactions between them. We benchmark our proposal by studying the scattering of an electron or a proton against a hydrogen atom, showing the effect of electronic exchange and inelastic ionization as the mass ratio between the simulated nuclei and electrons (a tunable experimental parameter in our simulator) becomes comparable. These benchmarks illustrate how the simulator can qualitatively emulate phenomena like those appearing in molecular dynamical problems even if the simulated interaction occurs in two-dimensions with a dipolar scaling. Beyond the molecular implementation proposed here, our proposal can be readily extrapolated to other atomic platforms, e.g., based on fermionic Rydberg atoms.</p>

            <h2>Many body quantum chaos and time reversal symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijun Wu, Saumya Shivam, Amos Chan</p>
            <p>We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry and local TRS - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton O. Pokusinkyi, Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy</p>
            <p>Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.</p>

            <p>We formulate a semiclassical theory for electron transport in open quantum systems with electron-phonon interactions adequate for situations when the system's phonon dynamics is comparable with the electron transport timescale. Starting from the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism we obtain equations of motion for the retarded and lesser electronic Green's functions including contributions due to the phonon dynamics up to second order in the electron-phonon coupling strength. The resulting equations assume that the system's phonon follow classical time-local dynamics with delta-correlated noise. We apply our method to the study of the charging/discharging of a periodically driven quantum dot, and a three-level model for a single-electron pump, analyzing the signatures in the transient current, electron population and process performance of the phonon dynamics. For these systems, we consider external harmonic driving of the phonon at frequencies comparable with the electron modulation, and different scenarios, varying electron-phonon coupling strength, coupling to the electron part of the system, and in phase and anti-phase driving. Our results illustrate that our method provides an efficient protocol to describe the effects of nuclear motion in ultrafast transient phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Double commutator method for a two band Bose-Einstein condensate: superfluid density of a flat band superfluid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Cai Zhang</p>
            <p>In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band bosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid and normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can be easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have determined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal density by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the velocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we investigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and excitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities explicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the compressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid density depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of U(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we have observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum metric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the excitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid density of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction parameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid densities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation theory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior of a flat band BEC.</p>

We review the physics of twisted nodal superconductors, highlighting both similarities and qualitative differences with other moiré platforms. While inspired by the rise of moiré materials, the field is anchored in studies of unconventional superconductivity preceding the moiré era, which we discuss in detail. In addition to summarizing the developments at the present stage, we present a detailed outlook on the major open questions in the field and some of the most exciting future directions.</p>

A detailed investigation of the composition and equilibration conditions confirmed the reversible phase transition between a multi-phase state at low temperature and an entropy-driven single-phase solid solution at high temperatures. Electrical resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements of single-phase M1-xPtxSb (x = 0.2) samples revealed a bulk superconducting transition at 2.15(2) K.

First-principles calculations revealed Dirac nodal lines (DNL) near the Fermi energy in the electronic structure when spin-orbit interactions (SOIs) were absent. Although these DNLs mostly disappeared in the presence of SOIs, band crossings at high-symmetry points in the reciprocal space existed as Dirac points. Furthermore, DNLs protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry persisted on the ky = {\pi}/b plane.

            <p>Since Felix Bloch's introduction of the concept of spin waves in 1930, magnons (the quanta of spin waves) have been extensively studied in a range of materials for spintronics, particularly for non-volatile logic-in-memory devices. Controlling magnons in conventional antiferromagnets and harnessing them in practical applications, however, remains a challenge. In this letter, we demonstrate highly efficient magnon transport in an LaFeO$_3$/BiFeO$_3$/LaFeO$_3$ all-antiferromagnetic system which can be controlled electrically, making it highly desirable for energy-efficient computation. Leveraging spin-orbit-driven spin-charge transduction, we demonstrate that this material architecture permits magnon confinement in ultrathin antiferromagnets, enhancing the output voltage generated by magnon transport by several orders of magnitude, which provides a pathway to enable magnetoelectric memory and logic functionalities. Additionally, its non-volatility enables ultralow-power logic-in-memory processing, where magnonic devices can be efficiently reconfigured via electrically controlled magnon spin currents within magnetoelectric channels.</p>

            <h2>Efficient defect healing of single-walled cabron nanotubes through $ \mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{2} $-assisted multiple-cycle treatment with air exposure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Man Shen, Taiki Inoue, Mengyue Wang, Yuanjia Liu, Yoshihiro Kobayashi</p>
            <p>Defects in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) degrade their mechanical,electrical, and thermal properties, limiting their potential applications. To realize the diverse applications of SWCNTs, it is essential to enhance their crystallinity through effective defect healing. However, traditional thermal treatments typically require temperatures above 1800°C, which can alter the nanotube structure. Previously, defect healing of SWCNTs was achieved at a relatively low temperature of 1100°C, using C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ assistance, but the efficiency was limited. In this study, we developed a C$_{2}$H$_{2}$-assisted multiple-cycle process at an even lower temperature of 1000°C combined with air exposure, achieving highly efficient defect healing while preserving the nanotube structure. The combination of multiple-cycle treatment and air exposure between cycles was found to promote defect activation, suppress the formation of amorphous carbon, and enhance the effectiveness of defect healing. Additionally, we successfully healed commercially available bulk-scale SWCNTs (super-growth SWCNTs), noting that their healing behavior differed from lab-grown SWCNTs with smaller diameters synthesized from nanodiamond. The efficient and structure-preserved healing process developed in this study broadens the potential applications of high-quality SWCNTs, including flexible electronics, high-performance composites, and energy storage devices.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-induced phase transitions for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toranosuke Matsubara, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-André-Harper model with hopping rate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory method, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy and demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a critical potential strength $V_c/J \sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the measurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law phase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V< V_c$, while any finite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V>V_c$. This result is distinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law and area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the phase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it shows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in the area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing quasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation number with an off-resonant probe light.</p>

            <h2>Two-electron edge states in a double SSH-chain of quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keyu Wang, Peihao Huang</p>
            <p>We study an interacting two-body model with adjustable spin tunneling in the context of the double SSH chains for a quantum dot system. We discovered that varying interaction strengths and spin tunneling significantly influence the properties of correlated edge states in the energy spectrum obtained through exact diagonalization. We observe that stronger interactions lead to longer decay lengths of these states. Conversely, the decay length decreases as the difference in intracell or intercell tunneling increases. Importantly, the decay length is strongly correlated with the dynamical behavior of two particles; specifically, an increase in decay length corresponds to a decrease in motion frequency. This conclusion is supported by the observation of the expectation value of coordinate operators of the particles.</p>

            <p>Selective manipulation of particles is crucial in many fields, ranging from chemistry to biology and physics. Dielectrophoresis stands out due to its high selectivity potential and the absence of need for labels. To fully understand and control the phenomenon, observation of the dynamic of nanoparticles under DEP needs to be performed in the three spatial dimensions. However, not many microscopy approaches offer such capability at fast frame rates (>100fps) and high resolution. Here, we used widefield microscopy, to follow the spatiotemporal dynamics of fluorescently labelled polystyrene nanoparticles of 200 nm under positive and negative dielectrophoresis conditions. This real-time 3D imaging technique allows for single particle tracking, enabling super-resolved reconstruction of the DEP force and electrokinetic flows with unprecedented detail. We compare the differences for positive and negative dielectrophoresis conditions and rationalize these by direct comparison with dynamic modeling results. The framework shown here shows great promise to elucidate the frequency-dependent DEP behavior of nanoparticle, crucial for particle manipulation and sorting.</p>

            <p>Coupled spins in semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile platform for quantum computing and simulations of complex many-body phenomena. However, on the path of scale-up, cross-talk from densely packed electrodes poses a severe challenge. While cross-talk onto the dot potentials is nowadays routinely compensated for, cross-talk on the exchange interaction is much more difficult to tackle because it is not always directly measurable. Here we propose and implement a way of characterizing and compensating cross-talk on adjacent exchange interactions by following the singlet-triplet avoided crossing in Ge. We show that we can easily identify the barrier-to-barrier cross-talk element without knowledge of the particular exchange value in a 2x4 quantum dot array. We uncover striking differences among these cross-talk elements which can be linked to the geometry of the device and the barrier gate fan-out. We validate the methodology by tuning up four-spin Heisenberg chains. The same methodology should be applicable to longer chains of spins and to other semiconductor platforms in which mixing of the singlet and the lowest-energy triplet is present or can be engineered. Additionally, this procedure is well suited for automated tuning routines as we obtain a stand-out feature that can be easily tracked and directly returns the magnitude of the cross-talk.</p>

            <h2>Theory of hydrodynamic forces in electric double layers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Cramail, R. Lhermerout, E. Charlaix</p>
            <p>We present a theory of the hydrodynamic forces in the drainage flow of an electrolyte between a sphere and a plane with charged surfaces. Our theory considers a thin electrolyte film which is at all times in local equilibrium across its thickness. In addition to the usual lubrication force, we explicit the electro-kinetic force due to the transport of the diffuse electrical charges as well as the diffusio-kinetic force due to the transport of the excess ion concentration in the Electrostatic Double Layers (EDLs). Our general formalism covers both the case of non-overlapping EDLs and of overlapping EDLs. We study more specifically the mechanical impedance induced by an oscillatory motion of small amplitude of the surfaces. Among our main results, we show that the increase in damping due to the electro-kinetic effect is not monotonic with the surface charge, and we predict a diffusio-kinetic stiffness with a long-range decay in power minus four of the sphere-plane gap susceptible to overcoming the stiffness of the equilibrium Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek force. The comparison of our results with experiments could allow one to confront the theories of electrolyte transport in the Electrostatic Double Layers without adjustable parameters.</p>

            <p>The polymorphism and mechanism of helium compounds is crucial for understanding the physical and chemical nature of He-bearing materials under pressures. Here, we predict two new types of He-bearing compounds, MgHe and MgnHe (n = 6, 8, 10, 15, 18), being formed above 750 GPa by unbiased ab initio structure search. An unexpected bandgap is opened up in MgHe at as low as around 200 GPa. This is the first case of noble gas driven metal-nonmetal transition in all elements. The same mechanism is demonstrated also being applicable to other metallic elements, and making beryllium transform into a non-metallic state, a triumph that is impossible otherwise. Furthermore, the stability of the simple cubic phase of Mg (Mg-sc) is greatly enhanced by mixing with He, which lowers the critical pressure of pure Mg-sc from about 1.1 TPa down to 750 GPa to form ordered substitutional alloying phase of MgnHe on a simple cubic lattice of Mg. This is the first report on Mg-based noble gas substitutional alloy, in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that He preferring interstitial sites. The observed striking influences of He demonstrate the rich physics and chemistry of He-bearing compounds under ultra-high pressures.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in silicon foundry-process compatible ferroelectric (FE) thin films have reinvigorated interest in FE-based non-volatile memory (NVM) devices. Ferroelectric diodes (FeDs) are two-terminal NVM devices exhibiting rectifying current-voltage hysteretic characteristics that enable self-selecting designs critical for high-density memory. We examine progress in FeDs based on CMOS-compatible HZO, AlScN, and emerging van der Waals ferroelectrics. While FeDs demonstrate promising ON/OFF ratios and rectification capabilities, they face persistent challenges including limited write-cycling endurance, elevated operating voltages, and insufficient read currents. We provide materials-focused strategies to enhance reliability and performance of FeDs for energy-efficient electronic memory applications, with emphasis on their unique self-rectifying capabilities that eliminate the need for selector elements in crossbar arrays for compute in memory applications.</p>

            <p>Chains of triangular nanographene (triangulene), recently identified as realizing the valence-bond solid phase of a spin-$1$ chain, offer a promising platform for quantum information processing. We propose a superconducting spin-singlet qubit based on these chains grown on a superconducting substrate. Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we find a manifold of two lowest-lying, isolated spin-singlet states that undergo an avoided crossing. A qubit utilizing these states is thus protected from random-field noise and quasi-particle poisoning. We also introduce a mesoscopic device architecture, based on a triple quantum dot coupled to a superconducting junction, that quantum simulates the spin chain and enables control and readout of the qubit. An effective two-level description of the device is validated using time-dependent NRG.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taehun Kim, E. H. Hwang, Hongki Min</p>
            <p>In multilayer structures, the coupling between layers gives rise to unique plasmon modes, but analytic solutions are typically available only for bilayers due to the increasing complexity as the number of layers increases. We investigate plasmons in multilayer structures, including the effects of interlayer tunneling. By introducing the Coulomb eigenvector basis for multilayer systems, which can be solved exactly using Kac-Murdock-Szegő Toeplitz matrices, we analytically derive the long-wavelength plasmon dispersions both with and without interlayer tunneling. In the $N$-layer systems, we find that, in the absence of interlayer tunneling, the out-of-phase acoustic or charge neutral plasmon modes with linear dispersions ($\omega_\alpha\propto q/\sqrt{{1-\cos{\left(\frac{\alpha-1}{N}\pi\right)}}}$ for $\alpha = 2, 3, \cdots, N$) exist, while the in-phase classical plasmon mode exhibits its conventional dispersion ($\omega_1\propto \sqrt{q}$). When interlayer tunneling is present, the out-of-phase modes develop plasmon gaps that are governed by specific interband transitions, whereas the classical mode remains unaffected. These findings have broad applicability to general coupled-layer structures.</p>

            <p>FAPbI$_3$ is a material of interest for its potential in solar cell applications, driven by its remarkable optoelectronic properties. However, the low-temperature phase of FAPbI$_3$ remains poorly understood, with open questions surrounding its crystal structure, octahedral tilting, and the arrangement of formamidinium (FA) cations. Using our trained machine-learned potential in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a detailed investigation of this phase, uncovering its structural characteristics and dynamical behavior. Our analysis reveals the octahedral tilt pattern and sheds light on the rotational dynamics of FA cations in the low temperature phase. Strikingly, we find that the FA cations become frozen in a metastable configuration, unable to reach the thermodynamic ground state. By comparing our simulated results with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra, we demonstrate good agreement, further validating our findings. This phenomenon mirrors experimental observations and offers a compelling explanation for the experimental challenges in accessing the true ground state. These findings provide critical insights into the fundamental physics of FAPbI$_3$ and its low-temperature behavior, advancing our understanding of this technologically important material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mike Winer, Boris Hanin</p>
            <p>Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters. Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.</p>

            <p>Understanding the coherent properties of electron spins driven by electric fields is crucial for their potential application in quantum-coherent nanoscience. In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in electric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single orbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage modulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master equation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two distinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity, electron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven mechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold spin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity drives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum spin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin accumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin resonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which driving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing quantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Weak ergodicity breaking, particularly through quantum many-body scars (QMBS), has become a significant focus in many-body physics. Krylov state complexity quantifies the spread of quantum states within the Krylov basis and serves as a powerful diagnostic for analyzing nonergodic dynamics. In this work, we study spin-one XXZ magnets and reveal nonergodic behavior tied to QMBS. For the XY model, the nematic Néel state exhibits periodic revivals in Krylov complexity. In the generic XXZ model, we identify spin helix states as weakly ergodicity-breaking states, characterized by low entanglement and nonthermal dynamics. Across different scenarios, the Lanczos coefficients for scarred states display an elliptical pattern, reflecting a hidden SU(2) algebra that enables analytical results for Krylov complexity and fidelity. These findings, which exemplify the rare capability to characterize QMBS analytically, are feasible with current experimental techniques and offer deep insights into the nonergodic dynamics of interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Uncovering the rules governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the membranes that define biological cells is of central importance to understanding the physics of living systems. We theoretically and computationally investigate the behavior of model protocells -- flexible quasispherical vesicles -- that exchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external reservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We identify an associated nonequilibrium morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. This transition emerges due to the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving. Further, using insights from stochastic thermodynamics we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law that remains robust even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.</p>

            <p>Controlled stacking of van der Waals materials is a powerful tool for exploring the physics of quantum condensed matter. Given the small binding between layers, exploitation for engineering will require a breakthrough in stacking methodology, or an ability to take advantage of thicker defective stacks.

Comparing recursive Hendricks-Teller calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to published X-ray diffraction data, we obtain the key parameters describing the random stacking in mesoscopic flakes. These then regulate the electronic structures via specification of the random stacks in dynamical mean-field theory simulations. Hubbard repulsion induces strongly correlated metallic, band and Mott insulating layers, providing compelling evidence that electronic properties follow from the coexistence of more than the metallic and insulating planes associated by ordinary band theory.</p>

We study this model with a rate $p$ of magnetic site vacancies through a numerical approach. First, we analyze the effect of few impurities on the ground state, favouring non-coplanar configurations. Second, for finite dilutions, we perform parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations in the $(T,p)$ plane, showing the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the $q=4$ Potts transition.

            <p>Low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) is a surface science method that works primarily in the UHV environment. It provides information complementary to the other established techniques: it extends the limited view of scanning probe microscopies from nanometers to micrometers and measurement time down to tens of milliseconds, enabling to visualize the changes during sample treatment, e.g., annealing, deposition, and gas or light exposure. From the point of structural analysis, it allows the measurement of diffraction patterns from an area of diameter below 200 nm and imaging of phase distribution on the surfaces either through dark-filed imaging or LEEM-I(V) fingerprinting. The advanced modes provide local angle-resolved photoelectron spectra and surface potential distribution. In this review, we aim to describe the utilization of LEEM to study self-assembled molecular structures on solid surfaces. We present the LEEM instrumentation and analysis of measured data in a tutorial way to provide the necessary background knowledge to enter the field. In the second part, we summarize the knowledge obtained by LEEM for several selected systems, which points to the strength of LEEM in understanding the self-assembled molecular systems and its synergy with other surface science techniques.</p>

            <p>Regulation of topological structures and pattern formation is attracting wide interest in the field of condensed matter. Liquid crystals (LCs) represent soft matter with a remarkable combination of fluidity and anisotropic properties. Topological defects may appear in confined LCs under external stimuli.

Polar properties of NF supply more variability to topological structures. In this research, we present tunable 2D topological defect arrays in NF compound, induced by an alternating (AC) electric field in simple sandwich cells without pre-patterning. The observed arrays of defects form pseudo-square lattices, which character and periodicity depend on the frequency of the applied field and partially on the cell thickness. The observed effect is explained to occur due to the competition between elastic and electrical forces.

            <p>The strong correlation effect in cuprate superconductors have greatly enriched the phase diagram showing the co-existence of superconductivity with many intertwined orders. One of the prominent issues concerning the superconductivity mechanism is about the pseudogap phase which behaves either as cooperator or competitor for superconductivity and its fundamental reason remains still elusive. Here we report the measurements of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) in the model superconducting system Bi2+xSr2-xCuO6+delta with a transition temperature Tc~7 K. Although this system is supposed to be slightly overdoped, a pseudogap feature can be easily observed in the energy region of about 20-60 meV. A modulation of local density of states (LDOS) with a periodicity of about 4a0/3 (a0: Cu-O-Cu bond length) can be easily observed, which is also supported by the Fourier transformation pattern with wavevectors at about (0,+-3pi/2a0) and (+-3pi/2a0,0). Surprisingly, we find that the LDOS exhibits a clear antiphase feature in the pseudogap energy region below and above the Fermi energy, indicating that it is an intrinsic feature of the pseudogap phase. We interpret this modulation and antiphase feature as a possible consequence of the pair density wave due to the Amperean pairing with finite momentum. Our results give a deep insight on the understanding of the pseudogap phase in cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Asymptotic Freedom and Finite-size Scaling of Two-dimensional Classical Heisenberg Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingyun Yao, Chao Zhang, Z. Y. Xie, Zhijie Fan, Youjin Deng</p>
            <p>The classical Heisenberg model is one of the most fundamental models in statistical and condensed matter physics. Extensive theoretical and numerical studies suggest that, in two dimensions, this model does not exhibit a finite-temperature phase transition but instead manifests asymptotic freedom. However, some research has also proposed the possibility of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition over the years. In this study, we revisit the classical two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg model through large-scale simulations with linear system sizes up to $L=16384$. Our Monte-Carlo data, without any extrapolation, clearly reveal an exponential divergence of the correlation length $\xi$ as a function of inverse temperature $\beta$, a hallmark of asymptotic freedom. Moreover, extrapolating $\xi$ to the thermodynamic limit in the low-temperature regime achieves close agreement with the three-loop perturbative calculations. We further propose a finite-size scaling (FSS) ansatz for $\xi$, demonstrating that the pseudo-critical point $\beta_L$ diverges logarithmically with $L$. The thermodynamic and finite-size scaling behaviors of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ are also investigated and corroborate the prediction of asymptotic freedom. Our work provides solid evidence for asymptotic freedom in the 2D Heisenberg model and advances understanding of finite-size scaling in such systems.</p>

            <p>A thorough study of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ single crystals, which were grown from Sn flux, was performed using both bulk (heat capacity, ac susceptibility, dc magnetization, electrical resistivitivity, magnetoresistance) and microscopic (Mössbauer spectroscopy) techniques. Electrical resistance and magnetic susceptibility were measured also under high pressure conditions (up to 19 GPa and 9.5 GPa, respectively). Further insight into electronic properties and phonons is provided by ab initio calculations. The results indicate that EuZn$_2$P$_2$ is an antiferromagnet with strong Eu-Eu exchange coupling of ferromagnetic type within the basal plane and weaker antiferromagnetic interaction along the c axis. The Eu magnetic moments are tilted from the basal plane. Hydrostatic pressure strongly affects both magnetic (increase of the Néel temperature) and electronic (suppression of the band gap and semi metallic behavior) properties, indicating a strong interplay of structure with magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase diagram of the extended spin-3/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg model: A DMRG study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gui-Xin Liu, Ting-Long Wang, Yi-Fan Jiang</p>
            <p>Recently there has been considerable excitement surrounding the promising realization of high-spin Kitaev material, such as the quasi-2D compound CrI$_3$ and CrGeTe$_3$. However, the stability of quantum spin liquids (QSL) against single ion anisotropy (SIA) in these materials and the global quantum phase diagram of the extended spin-3/2 Kitaev model with finite SIA remain unclear. In this study, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to explore the quantum phase diagram of the generalized spin-3/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg (K-H) model accompanied with SIA $A_c$. In the $A_c=0$ limit, the spin-3/2 K-H model exhibits a quantum phase diagram similar to that of a spin-1/2 system, including two QSLs around antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Kitaev models. For models with finite $A_c$, we map out the quantum phase diagram around two Kitaev points and observe distinct types of in-plane vortex orders developed from these two QSL phases. Interestingly, series of nearly degenerate vortex configurations are discovered in each vortex phases. Using linear spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that these vortex configurations can be understood as a consequence of the quantum correction on a continuous family of degenerate classical states.</p>

            <h2>Ranked percolation model for the caking time of amorphous molecular powders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasco C. Braz, Nuno A. M. Araújo</p>
            <p>When amorphous molecular powders are exposed to high humidity levels or temperatures, the particle viscosity increases due to plasticization, promoting the formation of sinter bridges between pairs of particles in contact. Over time, these bridges facilitate particle agglomeration, eventually leading to the formation of a macroscopic cake that alters the mechanical properties and affects product quality. In this work, we model the caking process of amorphous powders subjected to a temperature shock as a bond percolation problem and investigate how particle bed heterogeneities influence the percolation threshold and, consequently, the expected caking times. Our findings indicate that a slight dispersion in particle size lowers the percolation threshold compared to a monodisperse bed or random percolation in polydisperse systems. Furthermore, we show that the expected caking time exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with the size dispersion, initially decreasing for low dispersion values and increasing for higher values. These results provide insights into the role of the particle size distribution on the caking dynamics of amorphous molecular powders</p>

            <p>Superconducting high-entropy alloys (HEAs) present a unique platform for studying the effect of disorder, composition, and crystal structure on superconducting pairing. In this study, we present a comprehensive bulk and microscopic investigation of the rarely observed equiatomic hexagonal HEA Nb-Mo-Ru-Re-Ir using magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Our findings confirm bulk type-II superconductivity with a transition temperature of 4.63(2) K and a high upper critical field. Heat capacity and transverse-field $\mu$SR data reveal conventional s-wave superconductivity, while zero-field $\mu$SR results suggest the preservation of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. These findings provide valuable insights into the superconducting pairing mechanism in disordered multicomponent systems.</p>

            <p>Stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) many-particle systems are distinguished by a structure factor that vanishes not only at zero wavenumber (as in ``standard'' hyperuniform systems) but also across an extended range of wavenumbers near the origin. We generate disordered SHU packings of identical and `nonoverlapping' spheres in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space using a modified collective-coordinate optimization algorithm that incorporates a soft-core repulsive potential between particles in addition to the standard stealthy pair potential. These SHU packings are ultradense, spanning a broad spectrum of structures depending on the stealthiness parameter $\chi$. We consider two-phase media composed of hard particles derived from ultradense SHU packings embedded in a matrix phase, with varying stealthiness parameter $\chi$ and packing fractions $\phi$. Our main objective is the estimation of the dynamical physical properties of such two-phase media, namely, the effective dynamic dielectric constant and the time-dependent diffusion spreadability, which is directly related to nuclear magnetic relaxation in fluid-saturated porous media. We show through spreadability that two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit faster interphase diffusion due to the higher packing fractions achievable compared to media obtained without soft-core repulsion. The imaginary part of the effective dynamic dielectric constant of SHU packings vanishes at a small wavenumber, implying perfect transparency for the corresponding wavevectors. We also obtain cross-property relations between transparency characteristics and long-time behavior of the spreadability for such two-phase media. Our results demonstrate that disordered two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit advantageous transport and optical behaviors of both theoretical and experimental significance.</p>

Our framework integrates the Doob $h$-transformation with the Montroll defect theory, overcoming the strict constraints associated with each method alone. By combining these two approaches, we map random walks in simple potentials onto processes involving more general external potentials and metastable states. Explicit analytical expressions relate the transformed process to the original one, facilitating direct investigation of exponential decay rates and additional dynamical modes. As an illustrative example, we demonstrate our method by analyzing a random walker in a linear potential modified to include a metastable state, revealing distinct exponential decay regimes relevant to escape dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Sharma, Poulomi Sadhukhan</p>
            <p>Fibrinogen, the monomeric unit of fibrin, the main constituent of blood clot, has a very complex structure. The fibrinogen builds the fibrin fiber and network through the half-staggered packing via knob-hole interaction and the $\alpha$C crosslinkers. Due to its rich structure, the elastic behavior also shows a unique nature of very high stretchability and multiple regimes in stress-strain behaviour, which is not yet fully understood. We develop an Unfolding-incorporated Coarse-Grained Polymer (UCGP) model for fibrinogen to study the effect of domain unfolding on the mechanical behavior of fibrin fiber and network. Our model captures the stretching behavior of fibrinogen as observed in AFM and all-atom simulations. We further extend our model to fibrin fiber to study the effect of molecular unfolding at the fiber and network level. We anticipate that our model will be able to account for the nonlinear mechanical behavior of crosslinked fibrin gel. It is possibly the first model of this sort to consider the precise, controllable knowledge of the effects of domain unfolding in crosslinked proteins. This model can also be used to model systems that have sacrificial bonds.</p>

            <p>Europium-based materials are highly attractive due to their diverse range of physical properties. In these studies, we aimed to synthesize single crystals of the potentially topological semimetallic compound EuAgP, which up to this day has only been obtained in polycrystalline form. The flux method was employed for the syntheses, using fluxes such as: Bi, Sn, Pb, and In, in their various ratios. The purpose of using Bi flux was to try synthesizing an analog of EuAgAs single crystals, by fully substituting arsenic with phosphorus. The obtained crystals were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Despite many unsuccessful attempts to synthesize EuAgP single crystals, the study provides valuable insights into how different fluxes and their ratios influence the final synthesis product. It also underscores the complexity of designing analogs between arsenides and phosphides.</p>

            <p>This article reviews recent advances in low-temperature electronic thermal transport properties of thermally biased superconductor heterostructures focusing on the two-terminal transport. Since the last decade, ferromagnetism has been widely used to enhance the thermoelectricity in heterostructures based on ordinary superconductors. The possibility of getting giant thermoelectric effects with optimum thermal conductance by breaking the electron-hole symmetry of the ordinary superconductor boosted the research in this direction. Recently, attention has been paid to the role of triplet Cooper pairs that emerged in ferromagnetic junctions and the possibility of advanced applications. Other forms of magnetism, specifically antiferromagnetism and altermagnetism, have been investigated to unravel the behavior of the thermal and charge current in thermally biased junctions. In parallel to ordinary superconductors, junctions with unconventional superconductors have been explored for the same purpose. Thermal transport in superconducting bilayers has been studied using advanced materials like Dirac and topological materials, including Weyl semimetals. Significant attention has been paid to thermally biased topological Josephson junctions to explore the phase-tunable current in recent times. Weyl Josephson junctions, multi-terminal Josephson junctions, and various other multilayer junctions have also been studied to engineer large thermoelectric effects and various functionalities with potential applications in superconductor-based thermal device components.</p>

            <p>The discovery of correlated states in moire materials has challenged the established methods of projecting interactions into a local Wannier basis due to topological obstructions that manifest in extended interactions. This difficulty can sometimes be evaded by decomposing the band into a basis of extended itinerant states and a lattice of local states, using the heavy fermion prescription. We revisit this framework by systematically identifying the dominant interaction channels guided by the eigenvalues of the projected density operator. This approach can be applied both to tight-binding and continuum models, allowing us to identify a hierarchy in interaction scales that can be universally used to reduce the Hilbert space dimension and determine an appropriate local basis for modeling electronic correlations in interacting topological materials.</p>

In this work, we extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we find a clear evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by the dynamical quantum phase transition.</p>

            <p>Amorphous metal-organic frameworks are an important emerging materials class that combine the attractive physical properties of the amorphous state with the versatility of metal-organic framework (MOF) chemistry. The structures of amorphous MOFs have largely been inferred by drawing analogies to crystalline polymorphs and inorganic glasses, but ultimately the validity of such structural models has been challenging to establish either experimentally or computationally. Here we use a unified data-driven approach, combining experimental scattering data and active machine learning for interatomic potentials, to determine the structure of an amorphous zeolitic imidazolate framework (a-ZIF) -- the canonical amorphous MOF. Our results reveal clear differences between the structure of a-ZIF and that of other amorphous tetrahedral networks, allowing us to invalidate the long-standing assumption that these inorganic and hybrid glasses are topologically equivalent. To this end, we introduce a systematic notation for the network topology of amorphous solids, building a bridge to the successful use of topology analysis in crystalline MOFs and to materials informatics. Our work provides insights into the structure and topology of the archetypal amorphous MOF and opens up new avenues for modelling and understanding amorphous framework materials more generally.</p>

            <p>The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility edges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</p>

            <p>The innate tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a primary manifestation of quantum statistics. This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into already occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of light scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\rm f}$, where $N_{\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state. Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have a dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local) beyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can completely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive ones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of magnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics. Its extreme sensitivity to dynamical beyond-mean-field effects makes off-resonant light scattering a simple and powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic gases.</p>

            <p>UTe$_2$ has been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies in recent years, as it is recognized as an odd-parity bulk superconductor. Its surface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density wave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we propose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface and in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual features detected by surface probes in this material. Through a phenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental signatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of CDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii) the magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the CDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature and its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental checks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.</p>

            <p>Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a supervised learning algorithm that trains network parameters using local neuronal activity. This is in stark contrast to backpropagation, where updating the parameters of the network requires significant data shuffling. Avoiding data movement makes EP particularly compelling as a learning framework for energy-efficient training on neuromorphic systems. In this work, we assess the ability of EP to learn on hardware that contain physical uncertainties. This is particularly important for researchers concerned with hardware implementations of self-learning systems that utilize EP. Our results demonstrate that deep, multi-layer neural network architectures can be trained successfully using EP in the presence of finite uncertainties, up to a critical limit. This limit is independent of the training dataset, and can be scaled through sampling the network according to the central limit theorem. Additionally, we demonstrate improved model convergence and performance for finite levels of uncertainty on the MNIST, KMNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Optimal performance is found for networks trained with uncertainties close to the critical limit. Our research supports future work to build self-learning hardware in situ with EP.</p>

The Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for such finite-temperature systems exhibits a symmetry group $G_1 \times G_2$ weakly broken to its diagonal subgroup $G_{\text{diag}}$, which we systematically describe using spurion techniques. For $G = U(1)$, we calculate leading-order corrections to correlation functions in both diffusive and spontaneously broken phases. Unlike systems with approximate symmetries where both real and imaginary parts of dispersion relations receive corrections, ajar systems modify only the imaginary part -- preserving gapless modes while adding finite damping.</p>

            <p>Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.</p>

            <p>Twin photons and triple photons generations require pump laser intensities of several hundred Mega Watts per square centimeter. Micrometer sized crystalline waveguides allow such interactions to be achieved at relatively low energies by taking advantage of the confinement of light. The materials selected to achieve these phenomena in the present work are from the titanyl phosphate family. The chosen architecture is a micrometric layer of KTA grown on a KTP substrate forming a planar waveguide in a first step. These two isostructural materials have a low lattice parameter mismatch, making it possible to achieve high quality epitaxial growth. The refractive index of KTA being higher than that of KTP, this couple of materials could allow light to be guided in the deposited layer. To grow the KTA film, the chosen technique is pulsed laser deposition (PLD) that allows nonlinear complex oxides layer of optical quality to be grown. In this study, we show that the growth is well oriented for layers with a thickness up to 200 nm after deposition. Then, after annealing, the crystal state is improved as well as the surface. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of KTA epitaxy over KTP by PLD with good epitaxial quality, good orientation and theoretical phase-matching conditions for a planar KTA waveguide.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yagya Woli, Bryson Krause, Thang Hoang</p>
            <p>Random lasing occurs as the result of coherent optical feedback from random scattering centers. Plasmonic nanostructures, such as silver or gold nanoparticles, efficiently scatter light due to the formation of hot spots and optical confinement at the nanoscale. In this work, using silver nanocubes as highly efficient light scattering centers, a broad band plasmon assisted lasing action of halide perovskite materials is demonstrated. By embedding silver nanocubes in CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 solutions, narrow bandwidth lasing modes with a full width at half-maximum of approximately 1 nm are supported. It is observed that the lasing thresholds of perovskites are different for glass and gold substrates, and for different nanocube concentrations. Results of time-resolved measurements indicate a significant shortening in the decay time of the emission at above the lasing threshold, implying a stimulated emission process. The results of this work thus provide a pathway to generate coherent light sources from widely studied perovskite materials.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Many-Body Linear Algebra, Hamiltonian Moments, and a Coupled Cluster Inspired Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhang Ai, Huanchen Zhai, Johannes Tölle, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan</p>
            <p>We propose a general strategy to develop quantum many-body approximations of primitives in linear algebra algorithms. As a practical example, we introduce a coupled-cluster inspired framework to produce approximate Hamiltonian moments, and demonstrate its application in various linear algebra algorithms for ground state estimation. Through numerical examples, we illustrate the difference between the ground-state energies arising from quantum many-body linear algebra and those from the analogous many-body perturbation theory. Our results support the general idea of designing quantum many-body approximations outside of perturbation theory, providing a route to new algorithms and approximations.</p>

            <h2>Concept and Demonstration of a Low-cost Compact Electron Microscope Enabled by a Photothermionic Carbon Nanotube Cathode</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Casimir Kuzyk, Alexander Dimitrakopoulos, Alireza Nojeh</p>
            <p>The scanning electron microscope (SEM) delivers high resolution, high depth of focus and an image quality as if microscopic objects are seen by the naked eye. This makes it not only a powerful scientific instrument, but a tool inherently applicable to nearly all fields of study and curiosity involving the small scale. However, SEMs have remained complex, expensive, and beyond the reach of many. To broaden access, we demonstrate an SEM using simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf components, and hobby-level electromechanics; this has been enabled by a unique thermionic electron source based on a carbon nanotube array excited by low optical power. The instrument offers sub-micrometer resolution, a depth of focus of several hundred micrometers, and an image quality comparable to commercial SEMs; it also tolerates poor vacuum and moist specimens, making it broadly applicable. It has a flexible design that lends itself to easy customization for different use scenarios. We provide the conceptual approach and high-level design in this paper; the detailed blueprints of our specific implementation will be provided separately online. We hope that specialists and non-specialists alike will build variations that fit their own needs and interests, helping electron microscopy expand into diverse new sectors of society and industry.</p>

            <h2>Multimodal machine learning with large language embedding model for polymer property prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianren Zhang, Dai-Bei Yang</p>
            <p>Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.</p>

            <h2>Structural Boundary State Transitions in Turbulent Pipe Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Moriconi, G. Saisse</p>
            <p>Extensive optical measurements of canonical turbulent pipe flows have revealed the existence of structural boundary states (SBSs) -- near-wall low-speed streaks strongly correlated with pairs of counter-rotating quasi-streamwise vortices. In this study, we investigate the number fluctuations of these structures within the framework of statistical mechanics. Specifically, we introduce reduced degrees of freedom to model the low-speed streaks as a dilute lattice gas of hard-core particles. The Metropolis stochastic evolution provides, furthermore, a simple yet effective two-parameter model for describing SBS transitions. The lattice gas approach enables us to derive both the probability of SBS occurrence and the peculiar self-similar correlations that these structures exhibit along the streamwise direction. Our findings give additional support to the idea that the statistically stationary regimes of wall-bounded turbulent flows can be understood as Markov chains of coherent dynamical states in reduced-dimensional phase spaces.</p>

            <h2>Momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum of electromagnetic, acoustic, and water waves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantin Y. Bliokh</p>
            <p>Waves of various types carry momentum, which is associated with their propagation direction, i.e., the phase gradient. The circulation of the wave momentum density gives rise to orbital angular momentum (AM). Additionally, for waves described by vector fields, local rotation of the wavefield produces spin AM (or simply, spin). These dynamical wave properties become particularly significant in structured (i.e., inhomogeneous) wavefields. Here we provide an introduction and overview of the momentum and AM properties for a variety of classical waves: electromagnetic, sound, elastic, plasma waves, and water surface waves. A unified field-theory approach, based on Noether's theorem, offers a general framework to describe these diverse physical systems, encompassing longitudinal, transverse, and mixed waves with different dispersion characteristics. We also discuss observable manifestations of the wave momentum and AM providing clear physical interpretations of the derived quantities.</p>

            <h2>Simulating cell populations with explicit cell cycle length -- implications to cell cycle dependent tumour therapy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Boldog, Gergely Röst</p>
            <p>In this study, we present a stochastic simulation model designed to explicitly incorporate cell cycle length, overcoming limitations associated with classical compartmental models. Our approach employs a delay mechanism to represent the cell cycle, allowing the use of arbitrary distributions for cell cycle lengths. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model by fitting it to experimental data from melanoma cell lines previously studied by Vittadello et al. Notably, our model successfully replicates experimentally observed synchronization phenomena that multi-stage models could not adequately explain. By using a gamma distribution to model cell cycle lengths, we achieved excellent agreement between our simulations and empirical data, while significantly reducing computational complexity and parameter estimation challenges inherent in multi-stage approaches. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating cell cycle lengths in modeling cell populations, with potential implications for optimizing cell cycle-dependent tumor therapies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahshid Iraniparast, Nishant Kumar, Igor Sokolov</p>
            <p>Optical-based nanothermometry represents a transformative approach for precise temperature measurements at the nanoscale, which finds versatile applications across biology, medicine, and electronics. The assembly of ratiometric fluorescent 40 nm nanoparticles designed to serve as individual nanothermometers is introduced here. These nanoparticles exhibit unprecedented sensitivity (11% /K) and temperature resolution 128 \, \mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2} \cdot \mathrm{W} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-2}, outperforming existing optical nanothermometers by factors of 2-6 and 455, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the encapsulation of fluorescent molecules with high density inside the mesoporous matrix. It becomes possible after incorporating hydrophobic groups into the silica matrix, which effectively prevents water ingress and dye leaking. A practical application of these nanothermometers is demonstrated using confocal microscopy, showcasing their ability to map temperature distributions accurately. This methodology is compatible with any fluorescent microscope capable of recording dual fluorescent channels in any transparent medium or on a sample surface. This work not only sets a new benchmark for optical nano-thermometry but also provides a relatively simple yet powerful tool for exploring thermal phenomena at the nanoscale across various scientific domains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moniellen Pires Monteiro, Juan Pablo Carrillo-Mora, Nahuel Gutiérrez, Sofía Montagna, Aníbal R. Lodeiro, María Luisa Cordero, V. I. Marconi</p>
            <p>Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens is a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, worldwide used as biofertilizer. This soil bacterium possesses two flagellar systems enabling it to swim in water-saturated soils. However, the motility in soil pores, which may be crucial for competitiveness for root nodulation, is difficult to predict. To address this gap, we fabricated microfluidic devices with networks of connected microchannels surrounding grains. In them, we directly visualise bacterial behaviour in transparent geometries mimicking minimalist soils-on-a-chip (SOCs). We measured the population velocities and changes of direction for two strains: the wild-type and a mutant with only a subpolar flagellum. A detailed statistical analysis revealed that both strains exhibited reduced speeds and increased changes of direction of 180$^\circ$, in channels of decreasing cross sectional area, down to a few microns in width. Interestingly, while the wild-type strain displayed faster swimming in unconfined spaces, this advantage was negated in the SOCs with the narrowest microchannels. We employed the measured motility parameters to propose a realistic model and simulate B. diazoefficiens confined dynamics being able to reproduce their behaviour, which additionally can be extended enabling further predictions for long time and macro scales. This multidisciplinary work, combining design, microfabrication, microbiology and modelling, offers useful methods to study soil bacteria and may be readily extended to other beneficial/harmful soil species.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo de Souza Oliveira, Xin Li, Johannes Frey, Edoardo Milana</p>
            <p>The nonlinear mechanical response of soft materials and slender structures is purposefully harnessed to program functions by design in soft robotic actuators, such as sequencing, amplified response, fast energy release, etc. However, typical designs of nonlinear actuators - e.g. balloons, inverted membranes, springs - have limited design parameters space and complex fabrication processes, hindering the achievement of more elaborated functions. Mechanical metamaterials, on the other hand, have very large design parameter spaces, which allow fine-tuning of nonlinear behaviours. In this work, we present a novel approach to fabricate nonlinear inflatables based on metamaterials and origami (Meta-Ori) as monolithic parts that can be fully 3D printed via Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) commercial filaments. Our design consists of a metamaterial shell with cylindrical topology and nonlinear mechanical response combined with a Kresling origami inflatable acting as a pneumatic transmitter. We develop and release a design tool in the visual programming language Grasshopper to interactively design our Meta-Ori. We characterize the mechanical response of the metashell and the origami, and the nonlinear pressure-volume curve of the Meta-Ori inflatable and, lastly, we demonstrate the actuation sequencing of a bi-segment monolithic Meta-Ori soft actuator.</p>

            <p>The technological transition from soft machines to soft robots necessarily passes through the integration of soft electronics and sensors. This allows for the establishment of feedback control systems while preserving the softness of the robot embodiment. Multistable mechanical metamaterials are excellent building blocks of soft machines, as their nonlinear response can be tuned by design to accomplish several functions. In this work, we present the integration of soft capacitive sensors in a multistable mechanical metamaterial, to enable proprioceptive sensing of state changes. The metamaterial is a periodic arrangement of 4 bistable unit cells. Each unit cell has an integrated capacitive sensor. Both the metastructure and the sensors are made of soft materials (TPU) and are 3D printed. Our preliminary results show that the capacitance variation of the sensors can be linked to state transitions of the metamaterial, by capturing the nonlinear deformation.</p>

            <p>Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, the demonstrated structures are relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the previously unknown coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of top-down nanofabrication techniques.</p>

            <p>The maximum spreading of an impacting liquid drop is a key metric for characterizing the fundamental fluid process of drop impact. While extensively studied for Newtonian liquids, how far a non-Newtonian drop can spread upon impacting a solid substrate remains an open question. Here, by combining simulations, experiments, and scaling analyses, we establish a general framework for predicting the maximum spreading of drops of generalized Newtonian liquids, encompassing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening behaviors. Through an analysis of the energy budget at maximum spreading, we identify a characteristic shear rate that governs the viscous dissipation during drop impact. The finding allows us to map the spreading of non-Newtonian drops onto that of Newtonian drops, revealing the quantitative dependence of the maximum spreading diameter on various impact parameters and rheological properties of liquids. Our study addresses the long-standing challenge of understanding the impact dynamics of non-Newtonian drops, and provides valuable guidance for designing non-Newtonian liquids to achieve desired impact outcomes.</p>

Through a single tomography experiment, we infer all the relevant spin dynamics timescales, including precession, decoherence and relaxation times. We also demonstrate and quantify the measurement back-action induced, on the embedded spin qubit, by the detection of a single reflected photon. We show that the induced population and coherence of the spin state can be tuned by the chosen polarization basis of the measurement. The control of the photon-induced back-action on the embedded spin qubit constitutes a crucial requirement for the use of spin-photon interfaces as quantum receivers.</p>

            <p>The Haldane model is the simplest yet most powerful topological lattice model exhibiting various phases, including the Dirac semimetal phase and the anomalous quantum Hall phase (also known as the Chern insulator). Although considered unlikely to be physically directly realizable in condensed matter systems, it has been experimentally demonstrated in other physical settings such as cold atoms, where Hermiticity is usually preserved. Extending this model to the non-Hermitian regime with energy non-conservation can significantly enrich topological phases that lack Hermitian counterparts; however, such exploration remains experimentally challenging due to the lack of suitable physical platforms. Here, based on electric circuits, we report the experimental realization of a genuine non-Hermitian Haldane model with asymmetric next-nearest-neighbor hopping. We observe two previously uncovered phases: a non-Hermitian Chern insulator and a non-Hermitian semimetal phase, both exhibiting boundary-dependent amplifying or dissipative chiral edge states. Our work paves the way for exploring non-Hermiticity-induced unconventional topological phases in the Haldane model.</p>

The equation describing the time evolution of a probability coefficient of finding an electron in a subband is derived using the Krieger-Iafrate theory in the effective mass approximation. It is shown that an electron can change subbands during free flight due to the ODEM-induced inter-subband transitions. By introducing an effective dispersion defined as a weighted average of the subband dispersions, it is also shown that the initial acceleration of an electron effectively follows the bulk dispersion relation. The results obtained suggest that the transport properties of the quantized systems when many subbands are occupied in the weak confinement limit approach the values one would find without considering the quantization.</p>

            <p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in scientific research. Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system sizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on reducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for solving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In this work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework based on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly updates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by traditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various systems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural, dynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows for forecast intervals up to $30\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps, generating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than 4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended timescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments.

            <p>Skyrmions are topological structures defined by a winding vector configuration that yields a quantized topological charge. In magnetic materials, skyrmions manifest as stable, mobile spin textures, positioning them at the forefront of spintronics research. Meanwhile, their optical counterparts unlock new possibilities for manipulating and directing light at the nanoscale. Exploring the territories where magnetism and optics meet therefore holds immense promise for ultrafast control over magnetic processes. Here, we report the generation of a skyrmion-topological lattice through the inverse Faraday effect in a plasmonic metasurface. Specifically, a hexagonal array of gold nanodisks induces unidirectional drift photocurrents in each nanodisk, while counterpropagating phantom currents arise in the hexagonal interstices. This interplay creates a lattice of skyrmionic magnetic textures. Crucially, the all optical, large scale formation of skyrmions potentially at ultrafast timescales offers a pathway for integrating these topological spin textures into magnetic materials, laying the groundwork for next-generation data storage and processing technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabiola Ricci, Lorenzo Bardone, Sebastian Goldt</p>
            <p>Deep neural networks learn structured features from complex, non-Gaussian inputs, but the mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood. Our work is motivated by the observation that the first-layer filters learnt by deep convolutional neural networks from natural images resemble those learnt by independent component analysis (ICA), a simple unsupervised method that seeks the most non-Gaussian projections of its inputs. This similarity suggests that ICA provides a simple, yet principled model for studying feature learning. Here, we leverage this connection to investigate the interplay between data structure and optimisation in feature learning for the most popular ICA algorithm, FastICA, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is used to train deep networks. We rigorously establish that FastICA requires at least $n\gtrsim d^4$ samples to recover a single non-Gaussian direction from $d$-dimensional inputs on a simple synthetic data model. We show that vanilla online SGD outperforms FastICA, and prove that the optimal sample complexity $n \gtrsim d^2$ can be reached by smoothing the loss, albeit in a data-dependent way. We finally demonstrate the existence of a search phase for FastICA on ImageNet, and discuss how the strong non-Gaussianity of said images compensates for the poor sample complexity of FastICA.</p>

            <p>The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness, bonding strength, and scalability. In this study, we investigate strain effects in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near the diamond-SiO2/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain component increase of ~0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of ~0.71 MHz between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.</p>

This study proposes a post-processing method for constructing feasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained through CG.

Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.</p>

            <h2>Mitigation of correlated readout errors without randomized measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Skasberg Aasen, Andras Di Giovanni, Hannes Rotzinger, Alexey V. Ustinov, Martin Gärttner</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated in data post-processing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We present a readout error mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keshav Das Agarwal, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian transverse XY model with Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interaction having RT-symmetry, referred to as iKSEA model, possesses both an exceptional point at which eigenvectors coalesce and a quantum critical point where gap-closing occurs. To precisely estimate the magnetic field of the system, we prove that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the ground state of the iKSEA model, which is a lower bound of the precision quantified by the root mean square error, scales as $N^2$, with N being the system-size. This provides Heisenberg scaling both at the quantum critical point and the exceptional point in the thermodynamic limit. It indicates that when the system is in contact with the bath, resulting in this non-Hermitian model, reservoir engineering can provide enhanced precision of system parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate analytically that, in contrast to Hermitian systems, QFI surpasses the Heisenberg limit and achieves super-Heisenberg scaling ($\sim N^6$), when the strength of the KSEA interaction approaches the anisotropy parameter, permitting competition between non-hermiticity and hermiticity features, as long as the system size is moderate.</p>

Our results provide a plausible explanation for this scale-spanning signature and put in more firm grounds recent findings that indicate that traffic congestion at the aggregate level can be modeled by simple contagion dynamics.</p>

            <p>We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th Rényi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>XY models with continuous spin orientation play a pivotal role in understanding topological phase transitions and emergent frustration phenomena, such as superconducting and superfluid phase transitions. However, the complex energy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin interactions make these models computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of emulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings, allowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We experimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately determining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we implement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering sophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing unexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction schemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and machine learning problems.</p>

            <p>We present a combined oxygen $K$-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of the bilayer ruthenate Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Our RIXS experiments on Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ were carried out on the overlapping planar and inter-planar oxygen resonances, which are distinguishable from the apical one. Comparison to equivalent oxygen $K$-edge spectra recorded on band-Mott insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ is made. In contrast to Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ spectra, which contain excitations linked to Mott physics, Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ spectra feature only intra-$t_{2g}$ ones that do not directly involve the Coulomb energy scale. As found in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we resolve two intra-$t_{2g}$ excitations in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Moreover, the lowest lying excitation in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ shows a significant dispersion, revealing a collective character differently from what is observed in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Theoretical modelling supports the interpretation of this lowest energy excitation in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ as a magnetic transverse mode with multi-particle character, whereas the corresponding excitation in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ is assigned to combined longitudinal and transverse spin modes. These fundamental differences are discussed in terms of the inequivalent magnetic ground-state manifestations in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ and Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <p>The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase this http URL further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately this http URL constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.</p>

            <h2>Resolving the Corbino Shockley-Ramo Paradox for Hydrodynamic Current Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Hui</p>
            <p>Johnson noise thermometry enables direct measurement of the electron temperature, a valuable probe of many-body systems. Practical use of this technique calls for non-equilibrium generalizations of the Johnson-Nyquist theorem. For a hydrodynamic Corbino device, however, a naïve use of the Shockley-Ramo theorem alongside the "Corbino paradox" leads to yet another paradox: bulk velocity fluctuations cannot be measured by the contacts. In this work, we resolve the unphysical "Corbino Shockley-Ramo paradox" by correctly formulating the hydrodynamic Shockley-Ramo problem. This allows us to properly formulate the problem of current noise in an hydrodynamic multi-terminal device of arbitrary geometry, as well as validate a previously unjustified assumption for rectangular geometry results. As an example, we compute the Johnson noise in a hydrodynamic Corbino device, where we find a suppression of Johnson noise with magnetic field. This unusual characteristic serves as a strong signature of viscous hydrodynamic behavior.</p>

            <p>Solute segregation at low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) critically affects the microstructure and mechanical properties of magnesium (Mg) alloys. In modern alloys containing multiple substitutional elements, understanding solute-solute interactions at microstructural defects becomes essential for alloy design. This study investigates the co-segregation mechanisms of calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), and aluminum (Al) at a LAGB in a dilute AZX010 Mg alloy by combining atomic-scale experimental and modeling techniques. Three-dimensional atom probe tomography (3D-APT) revealed significant segregation of Ca, Zn, and Al at the LAGB, with Ca forming linear segregation patterns along dislocation arrays characteristic of the LAGB. Clustering analysis showed increased Ca-Ca pairs at the boundary, indicating synergistic solute interactions. Atomistic simulations and elastic dipole calculations demonstrated that larger Ca atoms prefer tensile regions around dislocations, while smaller Zn and Al atoms favor compressive areas. These simulations also found that Ca-Ca co-segregation near dislocation cores is energetically more favorable than other solute pairings, explaining the enhanced Ca clustering observed experimentally. Thermodynamic modeling incorporating calculated segregation energies and solute-solute interactions accurately predicted solute concentrations at the LAGB, aligning with experimental data. The findings emphasize the importance of solute interactions at dislocation cores in Mg alloys, offering insights for improving mechanical performance through targeted alloying and grain boundary engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilad Kishony, Mark S. Rudner, Achim Rosch, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>Simulated cooling is a robust method for preparing low-energy states of many-body Hamiltonians on near-term quantum simulators. In such schemes, a subset of the simulator's spins (or qubits) are treated as a ``bath,'' which extracts energy and entropy from the system of interest. However, such protocols are inefficient when applied to systems whose excitations are highly non-local in terms of the microscopic degrees of freedom, such as topological phases of matter; such excitations are difficult to extract by a local coupling to a bath. We explore a route to overcome this obstacle by encoding of the microscopic degrees of freedom into those of the quantum simulator in a non-local manner. To illustrate the approach, we show how to efficiently cool the ferromagnetic phase of the quantum Ising model, whose excitations are domain walls, via a ``gauged cooling'' protocol in which the Ising spins are coupled to a $Z_2$ gauge field that simultaneously acts as a reservoir for removing excitations. We show that our protocol can prepare the ground states of the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases equally efficiently. The gauged cooling protocol naturally extends to (interacting) fermionic systems, where it is equivalent to cooling by coupling to a fermionic bath via single-fermion hopping.</p>

            <h2>Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an advancing solidification front</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jochem G. Meijer, Vincent Bertin, Detlef Lohse</p>
            <p>Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing with gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a good agreement between mean dwell times measured in 50~nm diameter, perpendicularly magnetized superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (SMTJ), and theoretical predictions based on Langer's theory. Due to a large entropic contribution, the theory yields Arrhenius prefactors in the femtosecond range for the measured junctions, in stark contrast to the typically assumed value of 1~ns. Thanks to the low prefactors, and fine-tuning of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, we report measured mean dwell times as low as 2.7~ns under an in-plane applied field at negligible bias voltage. Under a perpendicular applied field, we predict a Meyer-Neldel compensation phenomenon, whereby the prefactor scales like an exponential of the activation energy, in line with the exponential dependence of the measured dwell time on the field. We further predict the occurrence of (sub)nanosecond dwell times as a function of effective anisotropy and junction diameter at zero bias voltage. These findings pave the way towards the development of ultrafast, low-power, unconventional computing schemes operating by leveraging thermal noise in perpendicular SMTJs, which can be scaled down below 20~nm.</p>

            <p>Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of a given outcome out of competitive events. This key observable of random walk theory, historically introduced as the gambler's ruin problem, is well understood for memoryless (Markovian) processes. However, in complex systems such as polymer fluids, the motion of a particle should typically be described as a process with memory, for which splitting probabilities are much less characterized analytically. Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out of equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids. These results are extended to $d$-dimensional processes in large confining volumes, opening a path towards the study of competitive events in complex media.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mauricio J. del Razo, Margarita Kostré</p>
            <p>Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</p>

            <p>Bilayers, soft substrates coated with stiff films, are commonly found in nature with examples including skin tissue, vesicles, and organ membranes. They exhibit different types of instabilities when subjected to compression, depending on the contrast in material properties between the two components. In this work, we unravel the mechanisms behind wrinkling instabilities in auxetic bilayer systems under uniaxial tension. We find that a soft bilayer in tension can experience significant lateral contraction, and with sufficient contrast in Poisson ratios, compressive stresses may induce wrinkles aligned with the tensile direction. We analytically model the onset of wrinkles and validate our predictions using Finite Element simulations in ABAQUS. Our findings reveal that wrinkles occur when the Poisson ratio of the substrate is greater than that of the film. As the two Poisson ratios converge to a common value, the critical stretch for instability shoots up rapidly and the wrinkles disappear. We also confirm these results through asymptotic analysis. Using inverse analysis, we design film microstructures to achieve desired effective Poisson ratios and further validate the effective properties with the Finite Element code FEAP. We show that the critical stretch ratio for buckling in auxetic structures with microstructural patterns is in strong agreement with the homogenized model predictions. The proposed method has significant potential for controlling surface patterns in auxetic skin grafts and hydrogel organ patches under mechanical loads. Moreover, the asymptotic expressions for compressible bilayers developed in this work can also be applied under finite strain for buckling-based metrology.</p>

            <p>In a multiply hydrogenated polymer of phenalenyl tessellation molecules (PTMs), spatially overlapping zero modes appear, and three spin-aligned electron spins per PTM are generated through direct exchange interactions in the strongly correlated electron system. This interaction was used to design a two-dimensional (2D) $S = 3/2$ Heisenberg spin system on a honeycomb lattice. Simulations of the electronic structure using density functional theory with the Wannierization method revealed an array of nonbonding molecular orbitals (zero modes) in the hydrogenated nanographene structure. Our analysis of the onsite interaction strength indicated that each zero mode was half-filled with a spin-active electron owing to electron correlation effects. The low-energy subspace of the resulting zero mode-tight-binding model suggests the formation of a 2D antiferromagnetic $S = 3/2$ Heisenberg system with an entangled quantum spin ground state.</p>

The model consists of the time-dependent GinzburgLandau equation and the thermal/spin diffusion equation whose transport coefficients (the thermal/spin conductivity and the spin relaxation time) depend on the order parameter, interpolating the values for the superconducting and the normal states. Numerical and analytical calculations show that the domain wall moves toward the higher temperature/spin-density region where the order parameter is suppressed. We can understand the motions of the domain walls as dynamical processes reducing the loss of condensation energy. We also analyze the driving force, the viscous force, the thermal force, and the force due to the spin accumulation gradient, on the basis of the momentum balance relations.</p>

            <p>In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction, Energy Windows Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW), we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Kohn Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate solve the KS equations till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the Muffin Tin (MT) sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the linearization energy of the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed, to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at the linearization energy relevant to that window) so that the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration of the solution of the KS equations. For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the implicit energy dependence of the basis of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW).</p>

            <p>We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved vertices and an interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments, charge carriers are injected into the material and the time until they reach a collecting electrode is recorded. Our approach allows direct evaluation of the expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in terms of a sparse, linear system, avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional Master Equation or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach by numerical studies of charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in diffusive and drift-diffusive regimes using a surrogate lattice model of a realistic material whose properties have been simulated within a multiscale model framework combining quantum-mechanical and molecular-mechanics methods. The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder from the reference baseline. Comparison with results from the Master Equation confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical implementations. We further show that KMC results show substantial deviations due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues and with the benefit of making use of sparse matrix methods.</p>

            <h2>Monopole magnetohydrodynamics on a plane: Magnetosonic waves and dynamo instability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debarghya Banerjee, Roderich Moessner, Piotr Surówka</p>
            <p>Condensed matter systems can host emergent `vacua' with particles, fields and dimension different from that of the universe we inhabit. Motivated by the appearance of emergent gauge fields with both electric and magnetic charges, we consider the fate of electromagnetism in two dimensions in the presence of magnetic monopoles. We find that generically electromagnetic fields are damped due to resistive effects. However, we can still identify a magnetohydrodynamic regime. It exhibits magnetosonic waves which, unlike in $d=3$, are isotropic, to which there is a contribution from the odd viscosity coefficient present in the system. Further, we find a dynamo action, which unlike in $d=3$ requires compressibility of the flow.</p>

            <h2>Ranking nodes in bipartite systems with a non-linear iterative map</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Mazzolini, Michele Caselle, Matteo Osella</p>
            <p>Ranking nodes in networks according to a defined measure of importance is an extensively studied task, with applications in ecology, economic trade networks, and social networks. This paper introduces a method based on a non-linear iterative map to evaluate node relevance in bipartite networks. By tuning a single parameter $\gamma$, the method captures different concepts of node importance, including established measures like degree centrality, eigenvector centrality and the fitness-complexity ranking. The algorithm's flexibility allows for efficient ranking optimization tailored to specific tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. We apply this method to ecological mutualistic networks, where ranking quality can be assessed by the extinction area - the rate at which the system collapses when species are removed in a certain order. The map with the optimal $\gamma$ value surpasses existing ranking methods on this task. Additionally, our method excels in evaluating nestedness, another crucial structural property of ecological systems, requiring specific node rankings. Finally, we explore theoretical aspects of the map, revealing a phase transition at a critical $\gamma$ dependent on the data structure that can be characterized analytically for random networks. Near the critical point, the map exhibits unique features and a distinctive "triangular" packing pattern of the incidence matrix.</p>
