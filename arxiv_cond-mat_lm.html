            <h2>Polarons and Exciton-Polarons in Two-Dimensional Polar Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Shahnazaryan, A. Kudlis, I. V. Tokatly</p>
            <p>We propose a macroscopic theory of optical phonons, Fr{öh}lich polarons, and exciton-polarons in two-dimensional (2D) polar crystalline monolayers. Our theory extends the classical macroscopic formulation of the electron-phonon problem in three-dimensional (3D) polar crystals to the new generation of 2D materials. Similarly to the 3D case, in our approach, the effective electron-phonon Hamiltonian is parametrized solely in terms of macroscopic experimentally accessible quantities -- 2D polarizabilities of the monolayer at low and high frequencies. We derive the dispersion of long wave length longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, which can be viewed as a 2D form of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation, and study the formation of 2D Fr{öh}lich polarons by adopting the intermediate coupling approximation. Finally, we apply this approach to excitons in polar 2D crystals and derive an effective potential of the electron-hole interaction dressed by LO phonons. Due to the specific dispersion of LO phonons, the polarons and exciton-polarons in 2D materials exhibit unique features not found in their 3D counterparts. As an illustration, the polaron and exciton-polaron binding energies are computed for a representative set of 2D polar crystals, demonstrating the interplay between dimensionality, polarizability of materials, and electron-phonon coupling.</p>

            <h2>Co-existing topological and Volkov-Pankratov plasmonic edge states in magnetized graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samyobrata Mukherjee, Viktoriia Savchuk, Jeffery W. Allen, Monica S. Allen, Gennady Shvets</p>
            <p>Graphene placed in a perpendicular magnetic field supports optical modes known as magnetoplasmons which are transversally confined to the graphene layer. Unlike ordinary graphene plasmons, these magnetoplasmonic surface waves are characterized by a band gap corresponding to the cyclotron frequency. In addition, these magnetoplasmon bands are topological, characterized by a non-zero Chern number. This leads to the existence of topologically protected edge states at domain edges where the Chern number changes. Since the Chern number is dependent on the direction of the magnetic field, edge states exist at domain edges across which the magnetic field flips direction. Physically, the magnetic field can only flip direction at gradual domain edges with finite width creating topological heterojunctions. These topological heterojunctions support extra edge states known as Volkov-Pankratov edge states which can enter the band gap and support propagation in both directions. The number of Volkov-Pankratov states at a heterojunction varies as a function of the width of the gradual domain edge.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-breaking induced surface magnetization in non-magnetic RuO$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dai Q. Ho, D. Quang To, Ruiqi Hu, Garnett W. Bryant, Anderson Janotti</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism is a newly identified phase of magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been considered a prototypical metallic altermagnet with a critical temperature higher than room temperature. Previous interpretations of the unusual magnetic properties of RuO$_2$ relied on the theoretical prediction that local moments on two Ru sublattices, which are connected by four-fold rotational symmetry, are quite significant (approximately 1 $\mu_B$), leading to long-range antiferromagnetic order. However, accumulated experimental data suggest that local moments on Ru in RuO$_2$ are vanishingly small, indicating that the bulk material is likely non-magnetic. This observation is consistent with the delocalized nature of the 4$d$ electrons of Ru and the strong screening effect in the metallic state. In this work, we show that despite the non-magnetic bulk, the RuO$_2$(110) surface exhibits spontaneous magnetization. We attribute this effect to the breaking of local symmetry, which results in electronic redistribution and magnetic moment enhancement. The emergence of surface magnetism gives rise to interesting spectroscopic phenomena, including spin-polarized surface states, spin-polarized scanning probe microscopy images, and potentially spin-dependent transport effects. These findings highlight the important role of surface magnetic structures in the otherwise non-magnetic bulk RuO$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Out-of-phase Plasmon Excitations in the Trilayer Cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Nakata, M. Bejas, J. Okamoto, K. Yamamoto, D. Shiga, R. Takahashi, H. Y. Huang, H. Kumigashira, H. Wadati, J. Miyawaki, S. Ishida, H. Eisaki, A. Fujimori, A. Greco, H. Yamase, D. J. Huang, H. Suzuki</p>
            <p>Within a homologous series of cuprate superconductors, variations in the stacking of CuO$_2$ layers influence the collective charge dynamics through the long-range Coulomb interactions. We use O $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to reveal plasmon excitations in the optimally-doped trilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$. The observed plasmon exhibits nearly $q_z$-independent dispersion and a large excitation gap of approximately 300 meV. This mode is primarily ascribed to the $\omega_{-}$ mode, where the charge density on the outer CuO$_2$ sheets oscillates out of phase while the density in the inner sheet remains unaltered at $q_z=0$. The intensity of the acoustic $\omega_3$ mode is relatively weak and becomes vanishingly small near $(q_x, q_y)=(0, 0)$. This result highlights a qualitative change in the eigenmode of the dominant low-energy plasmon with the number of CuO$_2$ layers.</p>

            <h2>Electric field tunable bands in doubly aligned bilayer graphene hBN moire superlattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priya Tiwari, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Aveek Bid</p>
            <p>In this letter, we demonstrate electric field-induced band modification of an asymmetrically twisted hBN/BLG/hBN supermoire lattice. Distinct from unaligned BLG/hBN systems, we observe regions in the density-displacement field (n-D) plane where the device conductance is independent of n and decreases as |D| increases. This distinction arises due to the angle asymmetry between the layers, which induces field-controlled layer polarization. We identify D-dependent additional band gaps near the charge neutrality point that appear in the conduction (valence) band for negative (positive) D values. In the quantum Hall regime, new 6-fold degenerate Landau levels are observed. Our findings establish that in an asymmetric supermoire heterostructure, an external vertical displacement field affects the valence and conduction bands very differently and sheds light on the asymmetric conductance patterns noted in previous studies.</p>

            <h2>Boosting superconductivity: how nanofaceted surfaces transform the ground state of ultrathin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Wahlberg, R. Arpaia, D. Chakraborty, A. Kalaboukhov, D. Vignolles, C. Proust, A. M. Black-Shaffer, G. Seibold, T. Bauch, F. Lombardi</p>
            <p>In the cuprate high-temperature superconductors doping is fixed during synthesis and the charge carrier density per CuO$_2$ plane cannot be easily tuned by conventional gating, unlike 2D materials. Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{on}}$ and the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c,2}$ in nanometer-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.</p>

            <h2>Non-renormalization of the fractional quantum Hall conductivity by interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Selch, M.A.Zubkov, Souvik Pramanik, M.Lewkowicz</p>
            <p>We investigate the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) proposed a long time ago by Lopez and Fradkin \cite{Fradkin1991chern}. The magnetic fluxes of the statistical gauge field attached to electrons remain at rest in the reference frame moving together with the electron liquid. In the laboratory reference frame the electric field of the statistical gauge field forms and screens the external electric field. The fractional QHE conductivity appears as a consequence of this screening already on the mean field theory level. We consider a relativistic extension of the model, and propose an alternative description of the fractional QHE based on macroscopic motion of the electron liquid within the Zubarev statistical operator approach. It is this macroscopic motion of electrons which in this pattern gives rise to the fractional QHE. Within this approach we propose the proof to all orders of perturbation theory that the interaction corrections cannot change the above mentioned mean field theory result for the QHE conductivity.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling three types of fermions in a nodal ring topological semimetal through magneto-optical transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiwon Jeon, Taehyeok Kim, Jiho Jang, Hoil Kim, Mykhaylo Ozerov, Jun Sung Kim, Hongki Min, Eunjip Choi</p>
            <p>We investigate the quasiparticles of a single nodal ring semimetal SrAs$_3$ through axis-resolved magneto-optical measurements. We observe three types of Landau levels scaling as $\varepsilon \sim \sqrt{B}$, $\varepsilon \sim B^{2/3}$, and $\varepsilon \sim B$ that correspond to Dirac, semi-Dirac, and classical fermions, respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we identify the distinct origins of these three types of fermions present within the nodal ring. In particular, semi-Dirac fermions--a novel type of fermion that can give rise to a range of unique quantum phenomena--emerge from the endpoints of the nodal ring where the energy band disperses linearly along one direction and quadratically along the perpendicular direction, a feature not achievable in nodal point or line structures. The capacity of the nodal ring to simultaneously host multiple fermion types, including semi-Dirac fermions, establishes it as a valuable platform to expand the understanding of topological semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Light-matter correlations in Quantum Floquet engineering of cavity quantum materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatriz Pérez-González, Gloria Platero, Álvaro Gómez-León</p>
            <p>Quantum Floquet engineering (QFE) seeks to generalize the control of quantum systems with classical external fields, widely known as Semi-Classical Floquet engineering (SCFE), to quantum fields. However, to faithfully capture the physics at arbitrary coupling, a gauge-invariant description of light-matter interaction in cavity-QED materials is required, which makes the Hamiltonian highly non-linear in photonic operators. We provide a non-perturbative truncation scheme of the Hamiltonian, which is valid or arbitrary coupling strength, and use it to investigate the role of light-matter correlations, which are absent in SCFE. We find that even in the high-frequency regime, light-matter correlations can be crucial, in particular for the topological properties of a system. As an example, we show that for a SSH chain coupled to a cavity, light-matter correlations break the original chiral symmetry of the chain, strongly affecting the robustness of its edge states. In addition, we show how light-matter correlations are imprinted in the photonic spectral function and discuss their relation with the topology of the bands.</p>

            <h2>Three-dimensional mapping of the altermagnetic spin splitting in CrSb</h2>

            <p>Altermagnetism, a kind of collinear magnetism that is characterized by a momentum-dependent band and spin splitting without net magnetization, has recently attracted considerable interest. Finding altermagnetic materials with large splitting near the Fermi level necessarily requires three-dimensional k-space mapping. While this is crucial for spintronic applications and emergent phenomena, it remains challenging. Here, using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and model calculations, we uncover a large altermagnetic splitting, up to ~1.0 eV, near the Fermi level in CrSb. We verify its bulk-type g-wave altermagnetism through systematic three-dimensional k-space mapping, which unambiguously reveals the altermagnetic symmetry and associated nodal planes. Spin-resolved ARPES measurements further verify the spin polarizations of the split bands near Fermi level. Tight-binding model analysis indicates that the large altermagnetic splitting arises from strong third-nearest-neighbor hopping mediated by Sb ions. The large band/spin splitting near Fermi level in metallic CrSb, together with its high TN (up to 705 K) and simple spin configuration, paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena and spintronic applications based on altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>Correlation Effects in a Simplified Bilayer Two-Orbital Hubbard Model at Half Filling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Jian Yang, Dao-Xin Yao, Han-Qing Wu</p>
            <p>Motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram and correlation effects using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a simplified bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model at half filling. Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <p>Adiabatic passage in systems of interacting bosons is substantially affected by interactions and inter-particle entanglement. We consider STIRAP-like schemes in Bose-Hubbard chains that exhibit low-dimensional chaos (a 3 site chain), and high-dimensional chaos (more than 3 sites).

            <h2>The study of the energy spectrum of a system of quantum micro-vortices in a bounded spatial domain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.V. Talalov</p>
            <p>This study focuses on microscopic-sized quantum vortex filaments that are shaped like a circle. The model we considered examines loops with different radii and a small but non-zero core diameter. These loops are located in a bounded domain $D$. The quantization scheme of the classical vortices is based on the new approach proposed by the author \cite{Tal22_1,Tal24_2}. For these loops, we calculate both the quantized circulation and the energy spectrum, which are perfectly non-trivial. To understand how the results we have obtained can be used to describe the initial stage of turbulence in a quantum fluid, we study a system of $K$ random, non-interacting vortices. We explain how specific energy and circulation spectra lead to the occurrence of turbulence in the context of the developed approach.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics and lifetime of geometric excitations in moir\'e systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhu Wang, Joe Huxford, Dung Xuan Nguyen, Guangyue Ji, Yong Baek Kim, Bo Yang</p>
            <p>We show that spin-2 geometric excitations, known as graviton modes, generally exhibit vanishing lifetimes in lattice Chern bands, including in moiré systems. In contrast to the Landau levels, we first numerically demonstrate that the prominent graviton peaks in spectral functions diminish rapidly with increasing system sizes. We explore how the choice of interaction affects the strength of these peaks, with short-ranged interactions pushing the graviton mode far into the continuum of excitations, where it can be significantly scattered due to the increased density of states. We also analytically investigate the short lifetime of the graviton mode. In lattice systems, continuous rotational symmetry is broken, leading to highly anisotropic gapped excitations that mix different angular momentum or "spins''. This is despite the surprising emergence of a "guiding center" continuous rotational symmetry in the ground state, which is shared by the graviton mode. Consequently, the graviton mode in Chern bands can be strongly scattered by the anisotropic gapped excitations. However, the emergent rotational symmetry implies that gravitons can be robust in principle, and we propose experimental tuning strategies to lower the graviton mode energy below the continuum. We argue this is a necessary condition enabling the observation of graviton modes and geometric excitations in realistic moiré systems.</p>

            <h2>Monitored interacting Dirac fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Martin Müller, Michael Buchhold, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>We analytically study interacting Dirac fermions, described by the Thirring model, under weak local particle number measurements with monitoring rate $\gamma$. This system maps to a bosonic replica field theory, analyzed via the renormalization group. For a nonzero attractive interaction, a phase transition occurs at a critical measurement strength $\gamma_c$. When $\gamma>\gamma_c$, the system enters a localized phase characterized by exponentially decaying density-density correlations beyond a finite correlation length; for $\gamma<\gamma_c$, the correlations decay algebraically. The transition is of BKT-type, reflected by a characteristic scaling of the correlation length. In the non-interacting limit, $\gamma_c\to0$ shifts to zero, reducing the algebraic phase to a single point in parameter space. This identifies weak measurements in the free case as an implicit double fine-tuning to the critical endpoint of the BKT phase transition. Along the non-interacting line, we compute the entanglement entropy from density-density correlation functions and find no entanglement transition at nonzero measurement strength in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing the hyperpolarizability of crystals with quantum geometry</h2>

            <p>We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of non-linear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced non-linear optical properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masoud Mohammadi-Arzanagh, Andrey Grankin, Victor Galitski, Mohammad Hafezi</p>
            <p>Nano-patterning has been shown to be a powerful tool for manipulating the vibrational modes of elastic structures, with applications such as optical-mechanical mode coupling. Inspired by these recent developments in phononic band engineering, we propose a nano-patterning scheme to enhance the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in phonon-mediated nano-film superconductors, such as aluminum. Using the finite element method, we simulate the lattice vibrational modes of nano-patterned films within the Debye model. Our results show that periodic nano-patterning softens the lattice vibrational modes compared to bulk films. It also increases the density of states at high energies, resulting in a couple of percent enhancement in $T_c$. Moreover, we investigate connections to random matrix theory and provide an experimental design prescription to optimize nano-patterning for further enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature.</p>

            <h2>Dispersion of neutral collective modes in partonic fractional quantum Hall states and its applications to paired states of composite fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koyena Bose, Ajit C. Balram</p>
            <p>The Moore-Read Pfaffian (Pf) state exhibits two distinct neutral excitation modes, the bosonic magnetoroton mode, and the neutral fermion mode. These two modes have been conjectured to be supersymmetric (SUSY) partners in the long-wavelength limit. Previous studies on these neutral excitations of the Pf state have shown evidence in favor of SUSY in the vicinity of the second Landau level (SLL) Coulomb interaction. Inspired by that, using the framework of parton theory, we test the SUSY conjecture for a state that lies in the same universality class as the particle-hole conjugate of the Pf, namely the anti-Pf (aPf) state, by constructing explicit wave functions for its magnetoroton and neutral fermion excitations and evaluating them for very large system sizes. As with the previous studies on the Pf state, we find that the long-wavelength gaps of the neutral modes of the parton state belonging to the same topological class as the aPf are close to each other for the SLL Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using the parton wave functions, we compute the dispersion of various neutral collective excitations, including the magnetoroton, neutral fermion, and parton-excitons, for several notable non-Abelian and Abelian states. Finally, we propose a parton-exciton ansatz for the gapped neutral excitation of the composite fermion Fermi liquid at quarter filling and compute its dispersion for the Coulomb interaction in the lowest Landau level.</p>

            <h2>Effects of rotation on the thermodynamic properties of a quantum dot</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luís Fernando C. Pereira, Edilberto O. Silva</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the effects of rotation on the physical properties of a quantum dot described by a radial potential and subjected to a rotating reference frame. The interplay between rotation and confinement is analyzed by solving the Schrödinger equation for the system, yielding energy levels and wavefunctions as functions of angular velocity. We compute key thermodynamic properties, including the density of states, magnetization, entropy, and heat capacity, in the absence of an external magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that rotation induces significant modifications to the energy spectrum, removing degeneracies and generating oscillatory behaviors in magnetization akin to de Haas-van Alphen and Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations. Furthermore, we observe an effect analogous to the magnetocaloric effect, where an increase in angular velocity leads to a decrease in temperature during adiabatic processes. These results reveal the potential of rotational effects to influence quantum systems and provide insights for future studies in mesoscopic physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zuzanna Werner, Andrzej Frączak, Valtýr Kári Daníelsson, Jacek Szczytko, Barbara Piętka, Helgi Sigurðsson</p>
            <p>Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light appears when the phase of an electromagnetic wavefront winds around its direction of propagation, also known as optical vorticity. Contrary to the binary-valued photon spin, the integer-valued optical vortex charge is unbounded with many advantages in optical communication and trapping and enhancing the capacity of data encoding and multiplexing. Singular optoelectronic and chiroptic quantum technologies rely on the development of coherent and compact light sources of well-defined and reconfigurable OAM. We propose an optically tunable discrete chiral exciton-polariton microlaser that leverages strong spin-dependent polariton interactions, structured pumping, and inherent cavity photon spin-to-angular momentum conversion to emit coherent nonlinear light of variable OAM. By choosing pumping patterns with broken inversion symmetry in the microcavity plane we invoke geometric frustration between spinor ballistic condensates which spontaneously obtain a high-charge circulating current locked with the pump polarization. Our optically configurable system requires only a planar cavity thus avoiding the need for specialized irreversible cavity patterning or metasurfaces.</p>

            <p>The multiband kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 exhibits complex orbital textures on the Fermi surface, making the orbital origins of its cascade of correlated electronic states and superconductivity a major scientific puzzle. Chemical doping of the kagome plane can simultaneously tune the exotic states and the Fermi-surface orbital texture, and thus offers a unique opportunity to correlate the given states with specific orbitals. In this Letter, by substituting V atoms with Ti in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, we reveal the orbital origin of a cascade of its correlated electronic states through the orbital-resolved quasiparticle interference (QPI). We analyze the QPI changes associated with different orbitals, aided by first-principles calculations. We have observed that the in-plane and out-of-plane vanadium 3d orbitals cooperate to form unidirectional coherent states in pristine CsV3Sb5, whereas the out-of-plane component disappears with doping-induced suppression of charge density wave and global electronic nematicity. In addition, the Sb pz orbital plays an important role in both the pseudo-gap and superconducting states in CsV3Sb5. Our findings offer new insights into multiorbital physics in quantum materials which are generally manifested with intriguing correlations between atomic orbitals and symmetry-encoded correlated electronic states.</p>

The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Significant Chiral Magnetotransport Magnified by Multiple Weyl Nodes</h2>

            <p>The intertwining of magnetism with topology is known to give rise to exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we explore the magnetotransport properties of NdAlSi, a magnetic Weyl semimetal that spontaneously breaks inversion and time-reversal symmetries and hosts a large number of Weyl nodes. We observe a significant negative magnetoresistance, which we attribute to the chiral anomaly associated with multiple Weyl nodes. Remarkably, the extracted chiral coefficient reaches approximately $52~\mathrm{m\Omega}^{-1}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}~\mathrm{T}^{-2}$, larger than many other topological materials. Additionally, we observe an exotic anomalous Hall effect with an out-of-sync behavior, where the anomalous Hall resistance does not exactly follow the field dependence of the magnetization, in contrast to that in conventional ferromagnets. These rich quantum transport phenomena, driven by the interplay between magnetism and Weyl nodes, establish NdAlSi as a prime platform for exploring the intricate topological behaviors of magnetic Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <p>We report on the influence of a photochemical doping method on the spin-valley polarization degree ($P_{c}$) of excitons in WSe$_2$ monolayers. By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p>

            <p>Confining electromagnetic fields inside an optical cavity can enhance the light-matter coupling between quantum materials embedded inside the cavity and the confined photon fields. When the interaction between the matter and the photon fields is strong enough, even the quantum vacuum field fluctuations of the photons confined in the cavity can alter the properties of the cavity-embedded solid-state materials at equilibrium and room temperature. This approach to engineering materials with light avoids fundamental issues of laser-induced transient matter states. To clearly differentiate this field from phenomena in driven systems, we call this emerging field cavity materials engineering. In this review, we first present theoretical frameworks, especially, ab initio methods, for describing light-matter interactions in solid-state materials embedded inside a realistic optical cavity. Next, we overview a few experimental breakthroughs in this domain, detailing how the ground state properties of materials can be altered within such confined photonic environments. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art theoretical proposals for tailoring material properties within cavities. Finally, we outline the key challenges and promising avenues for future research in this exciting field.</p>

            <h2>Strong Long-Wave Infrared Optical Response in a Topological Semiconductor with a Mexican Hat Band Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark J. Polking, Haowei Xu, Raman Sankar, Kevin Grossklaus, Ju Li</p>
            <p>Light sources and photodetectors operating in the far- to mid-infrared (FIR/MIR) band ($8$-$12~\rm \mu m$, $0.1$-$0.15~\rm eV$) remain relatively poorly developed compared to their counterparts operating in the visible and near-infrared ranges, despite extensive application potential for thermal imaging, standoff sensing, and other technologies. This is attributable in part to the lack of narrow-gap materials ($<0.1~\rm eV$) with high optical gain and absorption. In this work, a narrow-gap semiconductor, $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$, is demonstrated to exhibit an optical response $>10\times$ larger than that of $\rm Hg_{x}Cd_{1-x}Te$ (MCT), the dominant material for FIR/MIR photodetectors. A previous theoretical investigation indicated that chalcogen $p$ and metal $d$ band inversion in this material creates a Mexican hat band structure (MHBS), which results in a dramatic increase in the joint density of states at the optical transition edge compared to typical semiconductors. This prediction is experimentally validated here using single-crystal specimens of $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$ measured using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry over a wavelength range of $1.7$-$20~\rm \mu m$ ($0.73$-$0.062~\rm eV$). These measurements demonstrate a large enhancement in extinction coefficient and refractive index characteristic of a MHBS in the vicinity of the absorption edge, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The realization of topological semiconductors with a MHBS is expected to lead to high-efficiency detectors operating in the FIR/MID range.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Reitz, Stephan van den Wildenberg, Arghadip Koner, George C. Schatz, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>P-wave superconductors hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and practical applications due to their unusual pairing symmetry and potential topological superconductivity. However, the exploration of the p-wave superconductors has proved to be a complex endeavor. Not only are they rare in nature but also the identification of p-wave superconductors has been an arduous task in history. For example, phase-sensitive measurement, an experimental technique which can provide conclusive evidence for unconventional pairing, has not been implemented successfully to identify p-wave superconductors. Here, we study a recently discovered family of superconductors, A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), which were proposed theoretically to be a candidate of p-wave superconductors. We fabricate superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) on exfoliated K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$, and perform the phase-sensitive measurement. We observe that such SQUIDs exhibit a pronounced second-order harmonic component sin(2$\pi$) in the current-phase relation, suggesting the admixture of 0- and $\pi$-phase. By carefully examining the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation patterns of critical current and Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation, we reveal a crossover from 0- to $\pi$-dominating phase state and conclude that the existence of the $\pi$-phase is in favor of the p-wave pairing symmetry in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$.</p>

            <h2>Fermi-liquid corrections to the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of topological metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Pasqua, Michele Fabrizio</p>
            <p>We show that topological metals lacking time-reversal symmetry have an intrinsic non-quantized component of the anomalous Hall conductivity which is contributed not only by the Berry phase of quasiparticles on the Fermi surface, but also by Fermi-liquid corrections due to the residual interactions among quasiparticles, the Landau f-parametes. These corrections pair up with those that modify the optical mass with respect to the quasiparticle effective one, or the charge compressibility with respect to the quasiparticle density of states. Our result supports recent claims that the correct expressions for topological observables include vertex corrections besides the topological invariants built just upon the Green's functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such corrections are naturally accounted for by Landau's Fermi liquid theory, here extended to the case in which coherence effects between bands crossing the chemical potential and those that are instead away from it play a crucial role, as in the anomalous Hall conductivity, and have important implications when those metals are on the verge of a doping-driven Mott transition, as we discuss.</p>

            <p>Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Pichler, Wilhelm Kadow, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall states are the most prominent example of states with topological order, hosting excitations with fractionalized charge. Recent experiments in twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ and graphene-based heterostructures provided evidence of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, which spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and persist even without an external magnetic field. Understanding the unique properties of these states requires the characterization of their low-energy excitations. To that end, we construct a parton theory for the energy and momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of FQAH states. We explicitly consider several experimentally observed filling fractions as well as a composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled Chern band. The parton description qualitatively captures our numerical exact diagonalization results. Additionally, we discuss how the finite bandwidth of the Chern band and the non-ideal quantum geometry affect the fractionalized excitations. Our work demonstrates that the energy and momentum-resolved electronic single-particle spectral function provides a valuable tool to characterize fractionalized excitations of FQAH states in moiré lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Maeda, Yuri Fukaya, Keiji Yada, Bo Lu, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>We consider superconductors with unconventional magnetism and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductors under the influence of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.</p>

            <h2>Circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection from chiral superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyeong Ahn, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Integrating mirrors with magnetic components is crucial for constructing chiral optical cavities, which provide tunable platforms for time-reversal-asymmetric light-matter interactions. Here, we introduce single-crystal circular-polarization-selective mirrors based on chiral superconductors, which break time-reversal symmetry by themselves eliminating the need for additional components. We show that a circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection (CSPR) occurs for strong-coupling superconductors in the BCS-BEC crossover regime or beyond if the optical Hall conductivity is significant in the unit of conductivity quantum per unit layer, $e^2/ha_z$, where $a_z$ is the lattice constant along the surface normal. While the optical Hall conductivity in chiral superconductors is typically tiny, we classify three routes to obtain a large value. We demonstrate the significant optical Hall conductivity and the resulting CSPR with two examples: (1) superconductivity in doped quantum Hall insulators and (2) chiral pairing that preserves the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in the weak-pairing limit. We also discuss the application of our theory to the recently discovered chiral superconducting phase in rhombohedral graphene. Our theory reveals the potential of these classes of chiral superconductors as promising elements for building high-quality-factor terahertz chiral cavities.</p>

Our findings are corroborated by excitation-dependent Raman experiments. Additionally, we explore the anti-Stokes Raman spectra and observe an anomalously high anti-Stokes to Stokes intensity ratio of up to 0.8, which varies significantly with excitation laser power and crystallographic orientation relative to the polarization of the scattered light. This ratio is notably higher than that observed in graphene ($\approx$ 0.1) and MoS$_2$ ($\approx$ 0.4), highlighting the unique vibrational and electronic interactions in CrSBr. Lastly, we examine stimulated Raman scattering and calculate the Raman gain in CrSBr, which attains a value of 1 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ cm/GW, nearly four orders of magnitude higher than that of previously studied three-dimensional systems.</p>

However, nature normally does not allow SC and FM to coexist without significant degradation. Here, we introduce the first fully iron-based SC/FM heterostructures, composed of Fe(Te,Se) and Fe3GeTe2, and show that in this platform strong FM and high-temperature SC robustly coexist. We subsequently discover that chemical proximity effect from neighboring layers can universally drive the otherwise non-superconducting FeTe films into a SC state. This suggests that the ground state of FeTe is so close to the SC state that it could be driven in and out of the SC state with various other perturbations. Altogether, this shows that Fe-Te-based heterostructures provide a unique opportunity to manipulate magnetism, superconductivity and topological physics, paving the way toward new superconducting technologies.</p>

            <p>We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties with electronic band structure calculation of the Bi square net system PrAgBi$_2$. The magnetization and heat capacity data confirm the presence of a crystalline electric field (CEF) effect in PrAgBi$_2$. Analysis of the CEF effect using a multilevel energy scheme reveals that the ground state of PrAgBi$_2$ consists of five singlets and two doublets. The de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillations data show a single frequency with a very small cyclotron effective mass of approximately 0.11 $m_e$. A nontrivial Berry phase is also observed from the quantum oscillations data. The magnetotransport data shows linear and unsaturated magnetoresistance, reaching up to 1060\% at 2 K and 9 T. Notably, there is a crossover from a weak-field quadratic dependence to a high-field linear dependence in the field-dependent magnetoresistance data. The crossover critical field $B^*$ follows the quadratic temperature dependence, indicating the existence of Dirac fermions. The band structure calculation shows several Dirac-like linear band dispersions near the Fermi level and a Dirac point close to the Fermi level, located at the Brillouin zone boundary. \textit{Ab inito} calculations allowed us to ascribe the observed dHvA oscillation frequency to a particular feature of the Fermi surface. Our study suggests layered PrAgBi$_2$ is a plausible candidate for hosting the CEF effect and Dirac fermion in the Bi square net.</p>

            <p>In light of breakthroughs in superconductivity under high pressure, and considering that record critical temperatures (T$_c$s) across various systems have been achieved under high pressure, the primary challenge for higher Tc should no longer solely be to increase T$_c$ under extreme conditions but also to reduce, or ideally eliminate, the need for applied pressure in retaining pressure-induced or -enhanced superconductivity. The topological semiconductor Bi$_{0.5}$Sb$_{1.5}$Te$_3$ (BST) was chosen to demonstrate our approach to addressing this challenge and exploring its intriguing physics. Under pressures up to ~ 50 GPa, three superconducting phases (BST-I, -II, and -III) were observed. A superconducting phase in BST-I appears at ~ 4 GPa, without a structural transition, suggesting the possible topological nature of this phase. Using the pressure-quench protocol (PQP) recently developed by us, we successfully retained this pressure-induced phase at ambient pressure and revealed the bulk nature of the state. Significantly, this demonstrates recovery of a pressure-quenched sample from a diamond anvil cell at room temperature with the pressure-induced phase retained at ambient pressure. Other superconducting phases were retained in BST-II and -III at ambient pressure and subjected to thermal and temporal stability testing. Superconductivity was also found in BST with T$_c$ up to 10.2 K, the record for this compound series. While PQP maintains superconducting phases in BST at ambient pressure, both depressurization and PQP enhance its T$_c$, possibly due to microstructures formed during these processes, offering an added avenue to raise T$_c$. These findings are supported by our density-functional theory calculations.</p>

            <p>Transition metal oxides are a platform for exploring strain-engineered intriguing physical properties and developing spintronic or flexible electronic functionalities owing to strong coupling of spin, charge and lattice degrees of freedom. In this study, we exemplify the strain-engineered magnetism of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ in freestanding and rippled membrane forms without and with process-induced strain, respectively, prepared by epitaxial lift-off technique. We find that the deposition of Pt/Ti stressor suppresses the crack formation in the lift-off process and induces a ripple structure in the La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane. Laser micrograph and Raman spectroscopy show a ripple period of about 30 um and a height of a few um, where alternating convex and concave structures are subjected to tensile strain of 0.6% and compressive strain of 0.5%, respectively. While the freestanding La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, the macroscopic magnetic transition temperature (TC) of the rippled membrane is reduced by as large as 27%. Temperature-variable Kerr microscopy observation in the rippled membrane reveals that the spatial variation of TC to be approximately 4% of the macroscopic TC, which coincides with the local strains at convex and concave structures. The large reduction of macroscopic TC in the rippled membrane may be ascribed to the lattice disorders due to strain gradient. Our demonstration of tuning ferromagnetism by the ripple structure validates the high potential of the process-induced strain in epitaxial lift-off technique and paves the way for strain-mediated emerging physical properties in various transition metal oxides.</p>

It is found that metastable b-As transforms into gray arsenic (g-As) phase at a critical pressure of 1.51 GPa, followed by subsequent transitions to simple cubic arsenic (c-As) and incommensurate host-guest arsenic (hg-As) phases at 25.9 and 44.8 GPa, respectively. Superconductivity emerges above 25 GPa in the c-As phase, with the superconducting transition temperature ($T$$\rm_c$) remaining nearly a constant of 3 K. Upon further compression, $T$$\rm_c$ steeply increases to a higher value around 4.5 K in the incommensurate hg-As phase above 43 GPa. We use our results to update the structural and superconducting phase diagrams under pressure for the novel semiconductor, black arsenic.</p>

            <h2>Majorana flat bands and anomalous proximity effects in $p$-wave magnet--superconductor hybrid systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yutaro Nagae, Leo Katayama, Satoshi Ikegaya</p>
            <p>Flat-band Majorana bound states of nodal $p$-wave superconductors give rise to striking electromagnetic anomalies, reflecting their high degree of degeneracy at the Fermi level. However, experimental investigations of these states have been hindered by the scarcity of materials exhibiting intrinsic $p$-wave superconductivity. In this Letter, we show that Majorana flat bands can emerge in a hybrid system consisting of a conventional superconductor and a $p$-wave magnet, a recently proposed class of unconventional magnets that possess a unique composite symmetry known as the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry. The degeneracy of the flat-band Majorana bound states is protected by chiral symmetry from the BDI symmetry class, which originates from the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry of the $p$-wave magnet. Furthermore, we predict the robust appearance of a zero-bias conductance peak in a dirty normal-metal--superconductor junction containing a $p$-wave magnet, which serves as an unambiguous signature of anomalous proximity effects associated with the Majorana flat bands.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R.M. Lukmanova, I.A. Cohn, V.E. Minakova, S.V. Zaitsev-Zotov</p>
            <p>The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows stepwise resistance dependencies on an applied magnetic field. These resistance steps result from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, exhibit unusual dependence on the magnitude of uniaxial strain $\epsilon$. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal -- strong topological insulator -- trivial dielectric and proves the appearance of the surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 1\%$.</p>

            <p>Dielectric structures can support low-absorption optical modes, which are attractive for engineering light-matter interactions with excitonic resonances in two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, the coupling strength is often limited by the electromagnetic field being confined inside the dielectric, reducing spatial overlap with the active excitonic material. Here, we demonstrate a scheme for enhanced light-matter coupling by embedding excitonic tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) within dielectric hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), forming a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that optimizes the field overlap and alignment between excitons and optical waveguide modes. To tailor diffractive coupling between free-space light and the waveguide modes in the vdW heterostructure, we fabricate Fourier surfaces in the top hBN layer using thermal scanning-probe lithography and etching, producing sinusoidal topographic landscapes with nanometer precision. We observe the formation of exciton-polaritons with a Rabi splitting indicating that the system is at the onset of strong coupling. These results demonstrate the potential of Fourier-tailored vdW heterostructures for exploring advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>We report the first observation of a pressure-induced transition from a superconducting (SC) to an insulating (I) phase in single-crystal Ba1-xKxBiO3 (x = 0.4, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.58) superconductors. X-ray diffraction measurements conducted at 20 K reveal a direct relationship between this SC-I transition and a pressure-induced distortion of crystal structure. With increasing pressure, the lattice parameters a and c of the ambient-pressure superconducting tetragonal (T) phase are compressed continuously below a critical pressure (Pc1), wherein the pressure (P) dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) displays a small variation. However, upon further compression, the lattice of the compressed T phase displays an anisotropic change, and Tc shows a monotonous decrease. When the pressure reaches Pc2 (Pc2 > Pc1), the compressed T phase collapses along the c axis, followed by the disappearance of superconductivity and the appearance of the insulating phase. This SC-I transition is fully reversible, with the critical pressure increasing alongside K doping concentration. These findings are strikingly similar to the SC-I transition observed in hole-doped high-Tc cuprate superconductors under pressure. Identifying their commonalities could deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie high- Tc superconductivity in these two oxide superconductors with a perovskite structure.</p>

            <p>Previous studies on natural samples of pampaloite (AuSbTe) revealed the crystal structure of a potentially cleavable and/or exfoliable material, while studies on natural and synthetic montbrayite (Sb-containing Au$_2$Te$_3$) claimed various chemical compositions for this low symmetry compound. Few investigations of synthetic samples have been reported for both materials, leaving much of their chemical, thermal and electronic characteristics unknown. Here, we investigate the stability, electronic properties and synthesis of the gold antimony tellurides AuSbTe and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ (montbrayite). Differential thermal analysis and $\textit{in situ}$ powder x-ray diffraction revealed that AuSbTe is incongruently melting, while Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ is congruently melting. Calculations of the band structures and four-point resistivity measurements showed that AuSbTe is a semiconductor and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ a metal. Various synthesis attempts confirmed the limited stable chemical composition of Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$, identified successful methods to synthesize both compounds, and highlighted the challenges associated with single crystal synthesis of AuSbTe.</p>

            <p>We report the synthesis and properties of (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$, which is shown to be a $J_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{2}$ system made out of Ru$^{3+}$ moments in a honeycomb geometry. Bulk magnetization, heat capacity, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) rule out the presence of static moments or any spin glass phase down to 500 mK. All techniques suggest a crossover to a liquid-like state below about 40 K. The $^{7}$Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shift data suggest a non-zero $T$-independent spin susceptibility at low $T$. In zero field, $C_m/T$ shows $T^{-1}$ divergence which is consistent with vacancy-induced effects on low-energy excitations of the pristine Kitaev spin liquid. With field, power-law variations in the $^{7}$Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T$_{1}$ and magnetic heat capacity $C_{m}$ show quantitatively new scaling behaviors. A two-step entropy release in heat capacity is also observed putatively from $Z_{2}$ flux (low-$T$ step) and itinerant Majorana fermions (high-$T$ step). Based on these findings, we propose that (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ realizes a Kitaev spin liquid with no evidence of inherent magnetic ordering in zero field unlike $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ where approximately $8$ Tesla field is required to suppress magnetic order.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnetism, initially considered interesting but useless, recently emerged as one of the most promising magnetic phases for technology. Recently, a low symmetry antiferromagnetic phase, known as altermagnetic phase, have been discovered, where no time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry is observed in spite of a vanishing net magnetization, leading to non-degenerate bands from the opposite magnetic sublattices. In this work, we consider two representatives of orthorhombic $Pnma$ space group, namely, BiFeO$_3$ and CaMnO$_3$ and find altermagnetic lowest energy phase in both from our density functional theory calculations. We find a substantial spin-splitting in both systems along a high-symmetry path in the Brillouin zone without considering the spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Detailed features of the band dispersion obtained from our calculation confirm the lifting of sublattice spin degeneracy only in the $k_y$-$k_z$ plane while preserving the spin degeneracy in the other planes of the Brillouin zone. We provide a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on the magnetic space group (MSG) to explain our DFT findings and an insightful symmetry-allowed model Hamiltonian, which qualitatively agrees with our results. Additionally, we extend our symmetry analysis to encompass two other potential MSGs within the $Pnma$ space group that may host the spin-splitting phenomenon without considering SOI and the likely form of their Hamiltonian. These detailed studies pave the way for a deeper understanding of the spin-splitting phenomena within the $Pnma$ space group, offering insights into the intricate interplay between symmetry and electronic as well as magnetic properties.</p>

            <p>We present a theory of magnonic thermal Hall transport driven by many-body skew scattering. In field-polarized chiral magnets, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces three-magnon interactions that violate time-reversal symmetry and interfere with the four-magnon scattering, thereby breaking microscopic detailed balance and causing thermal Hall currents. This mechanism operates without disorder or Berry curvature and is intrinsic to interacting spin systems. We argue that it can be as significant as the band-geometric anomalous velocity, highlighting the importance of magnon interactions in thermal Hall physics.</p>

            <p>Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex networks.</p>

            <p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Identification of isolated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is a key step towards the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Here we show how the $T_1$-based noise magnetormetry of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center qubit can reveal the unique signatures of Majorana fermions attached to vacancies in a non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL). The $1/T_1$ of the NV center is found to be increased significantly when the working frequency of the NV center matches the energy difference between a MZM and a low-energy hybridized mode involving dangling Majorana fermions adjacent to vacancies. In experiments, this energy difference can be tuned by an external Zeeman field. Because of the large excitation gap of flipping a local $Z_2$ gauge field, the $1/T_1$ spectrum is robust against other fluctuations in KQSLs. Our study presents a promising pathway for identifying the non-Abelian phase in Kitaev materials.</p>

            <p>T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important role in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field model and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell undergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial distribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell shape. T1 transitions have a dual effect. Cells losing neighbours tend to relax their shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the statistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find asymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours. These asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell migration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.</p>

            <p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p>

            <p>Ab initio downfolding describes the electronic structure of materials within a low-energy subspace, often around the Fermi level. Typically starting from mean-field calculations, this framework allows for the calculation of one- and two-electron interactions, and the parametrization of a many-body Hamiltonian representing the active space of interest. The subsequent solution of such Hamiltonians can provide insights into the physics of strongly-correlated materials. While phonons can substantially screen electron-electron interactions, electron-phonon coupling has been commonly ignored within ab initio downfolding, and when considered this is done only for short-range interactions. Here we propose a theory of ab initio downfolding that accounts for all mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling on equal footing, regardless of the range of the interactions. Our practical computational implementation is readily compatible with current downfolding approaches. We apply our approach to polar materials MgO and GeTe, and we reveal the importance of both short-range and long-range electron-phonon coupling in determining the magnitude of electron-electron interactions. Our results show that in the static limit, phonons reduce the on-site repulsion between electrons by 40% for MgO, and by 79% for GeTe. Our framework also predicts that overall attractive nearest-neighbor interactions arise between electrons in GeTe, consistent with superconductivity in this material.</p>

            <p>We report on an integrated semiconductor chip where a single quantum dot (QD) is excited in-plane via a photonic-crystal waveguide through its nearest p-shell optical transition. The chirality of the waveguide mode is exploited to achieve both directional absorption and directional emission, resulting in a substantial enhancement in directional contrast, as measured for the Zeeman components of the waveguide-coupled QD. This remote excitation scheme enables high directionality (greater than or equal to 0.95) across approximately 56% of the waveguide area, with significant overlap with the Purcell-enhanced region, where the electric field intensity profile is near its peak. In contrast, local excitation methods using an out-of-plane excitation beam focused directly over the area of the QD achieve only approximately 25% overlap. This enhancement increases the likelihood of locating Purcell-enhanced QDs in regions that support high directionality, enabling the experimental demonstration of a six-fold enhancement in the decay rate of a QD with greater than 90% directionality. The remote p-shell excitation protocol establishes a new benchmark for waveguide quantum optics in terms of the combination of Purcell enhancement and high directionality, thereby paving the way for on-chip excitation of spin-based solid-state quantum technologies in regimes of high beta-factor.</p>

            <p>In easy-plane magnets, the spin-superfluid phase was predicted to facilitate coherent spin transport. So far, experimental evidence remains elusive. In this letter, we propose an indirect way to sense this effect via the spin-superfluid quantum interference device (spin SQUID) -- inspired by its superconducting counterpart (rf SQUID). The spin SQUID is constructed as a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) magnetic ring with a single Josephson weak link, functioning as an isolated device with a microwave response. The spin current is controlled by an in-plane electric field through Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This interaction can be interpreted as a gauge field that couples to the spin supercurrent through the Aharonov-Casher effect. By investigating the static and dynamic properties of the device, we show that the spin current and the harmonic frequencies of the spin superfluid are periodic with respect to the accumulated Aharonov-Casher phase and are, therefore, sensitive to the radial electric flux through the ring in units of the electric flux quantum, suggesting a potential electric-field sensing functionality. For readout, we propose to apply spectroscopic analysis to detect the frequency of the harmonic modes.</p>

Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases with strongly interacting bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments.</p>

            <p>Due to the lack of a net magnetic moment, antiferromagnets possess a unique robustness to external magnetic fields and are thus predicted to play an important role in future magnetic technologies. However, this robustness also makes them quite difficult to control, and the development of novel methods to manipulate these systems with external stimuli is a fundamental goal of antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we report evidence for a metastable reorientation of the order parameter in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor triggered by an ultrafast quench of the equilibrium order via photoexcitation above the band gap. The metastable state forms less than 10 ps after the excitation pulse, and persists for longer than 150 ps before decaying to the ground state via thermal fluctuations. Importantly, this transition cannot be induced thermodynamically, and requires the system to be driven out of equilibrium. Broadly speaking, this phenomenology is ultimately the result of large magnetoelastic coupling in combination with a relatively low symmetry of the magnetic ground state. Since neither of these properties are particularly uncommon in magnetic materials, the observations presented here imply a generic path toward novel device technology enabled by ultrafast dynamics in antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaobo Zhou, Sangeeta Sharma, John Kay Dewhurst, Junjie He</p>
            <p>Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This polarization arises from the momentum-dependent spin splitting, which is unique to altermagnets, and which induces a momentum-dependent optical intersite spin transfer effect. Furthermore, the ferrimagnetic polarization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. The excitation along the spin-polarized planes breaks the symmetry of the momentum-space magnetization distribution, leading to inequivalent spin-resolved charge transfer between sublattices across both momentum and real space. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferri-magnetic state.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Qi Wang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the reinforcement learning part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through reinforcement learning, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.</p>

            <h2>(Anti-)Altermagnetism from Orbital Ordering in the Ruddlesden-Popper Chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quintin N. Meier, Alberto Carta, Claude Ederer, Andrés Cano</p>
            <p>Altermagnets form a subclass of collinear antiferromagnets with spin-split electronic states. Here, we introduce the Ruddlesden-Popper chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ (including the perovskite SrCrO$_3$) as candidates for antiferromagnetic materials in which altermagnetism emerges from spontaneous orbital ordering, rather than crystal symmetry. Using first-principles calculations, we identify a layer-dependent spin splitting of the electronic states, driven by the interplay between spin and orbital order. We show that if the spin and orbital orders align in adjacent layers, the system exhibits a net spin splitting, and thus altermagnetism. In contrast, if either the spin or the orbital order is reversed in adjacent layers, we observe an anti-altermagnetic state where layerwise compensation leads to net zero spin splitting. We find that for odd $n$, altermagnetic and anti-altermagnetic phases can coexist, whereas for even $n$ and in the perovskite limit, the system remains strictly anti-altermagnetic. In both cases, increasing $n$ favors metallicity. Finally, we indicate that in odd $n$ compounds, epitaxial strain can promote the altermagnetic phase.</p>

            <p>We report the magnetic, magnetodielectric, and electric polarization properties of single crystals of the Co-based Kitaev Spin Liquid (KSL) candidate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ (NCTO). The sample shows magnetic transitions at 26 K, 16 K, and 5 K, consistent with the literature. The magnetic measurements along and perpendicular to the Co-honeycomb planes show a strong anisotropy in susceptibility and in Curie-Weiss (C-W) temperatures. The experimental anisotropic C-W temperatures of NCTO qualitatively match with the theoretical C-W temperatures, calculated using the HKTF model [C. Kim \textit{et al.}, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter \textbf{34}, 045802 (2021)]. We find from our temperature- and field-dependent dielectric and pyroelectric ($I_p$) current studies ($H\parallel ab$ and $E\perp ab$) that our single crystal NCTO samples do not have a finite electric polarization below 100 K. These $I_p$ studies confirm the absence of a magnetoelectric coupling and electric polarization properties in the title compound and suggest that the zig-zag AFM structure is more favorable than the triple-$Q$ structure with AFM Kitaev interactions.</p>

            <p>We study the particle-scale motion of highly polydisperse hard disks flowing in a two-dimensional bent channel. We use various size distributions of particles, in which the largest particles are up to five times larger than the smallest. The disks are pushed through an L-shaped channel to drive the particle rearrangements. Although the mean flow is essentially independent of the polydispersity, the motion of individual particles becomes more nonaffine on average for higher polydispersity samples. We characterize the nonaffine motion, finding a qualitative difference in the behavior of small and larger particles: the smaller disks have more nonaffine motion, induced by the larger particles.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing lossy state preparation for quantum sensing using Hamiltonian engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bharath Hebbe Madhusudhana</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent platforms for demonstrating quantum sensing below the standard quantum limit is the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. While a quantum advantage using several tens of thousands of atoms has been demonstrated in this platform, it faces an important challenge: atom loss. Atom loss is a Markovian error process modelled by Lindblad jump operators, and a no-go theorem, which we also show here, stating that the loss of atoms in all spin components reduces the quantum advantage to a constant factor. Here, we show that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if we constrain atom losses to a single spin component. Moreover, we show that in this case, the maximum quantum Fisher information with $N$ atoms scales as $N^{3/2}$, establishing that a scalable quantum advantage can be achieved despite atom loss. Although Lindblad jump operators are generally non-Hermitian and non-invertible, we use their Moore-Penrose inverse to develop a framework for constructing several states with this scaling of Fisher information in the presence of losses. We use Hamiltonian engineering with realistic Hamiltonians to develop experimental protocols for preparing these states. Finally, we discuss possible experimental techniques to constrain the losses to a single spin mode.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Mohammadagha, Mohammad Najafi, Vinayak Kaushal, Ahmad Mahmoud Ahmad Jibreen</p>
            <p>The aging sewer infrastructure in the U.S., covering 2.1 million kilometers, encounters increasing structural issues, resulting in around 75,000 yearly sanitary sewer overflows that present serious economic, environmental, and public health hazards. Conventional inspection techniques and deterministic models do not account for the unpredictable nature of sewer decline, whereas probabilistic methods depend on extensive historical data, which is frequently lacking or incomplete. This research intends to enhance predictive accuracy for the condition of sewer pipelines through machine learning models artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multiple linear regression (MLR) by integrating factors such as pipe age, material, diameter, environmental influences, and PACP ratings. ANNs utilized ReLU activation functions and Adam optimization, whereas MLR applied regularization to address multicollinearity, with both models assessed through metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R2. The findings indicated that ANNs surpassed MLR, attaining an R2 of 0.9066 compared to MLRs 0.8474, successfully modeling nonlinear relationships while preserving generalization. MLR, on the other hand, offered enhanced interpretability by pinpointing significant predictors such as residual buildup. As a result, pipeline degradation is driven by pipe length, age, and pipe diameter as key predictors, while depth, soil type, and segment show minimal influence in this analysis. Future studies ought to prioritize hybrid models that merge the accuracy of ANNs with the interpretability of MLR, incorporating advanced methods such as SHAP analysis and transfer learning to improve scalability in managing infrastructure and promoting environmental sustainability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V.I. Yukalov, S. Gluzman</p>
            <p>One of the most often used methods of summing divergent series in physics is the Borel-type summation with control parameters improving convergence, which are defined by some optimization conditions. The well known annoying problem in this procedure is the occurrence of multiple solutions for control parameters. We suggest a method for resolving this problem, based on the minimization of cost functional. Control parameters can be introduced by employing the Borel-Leroy or Mittag-Leffler transforms. Also, two novel transformations are proposed using fractional integrals and fractional derivatives. New cost functionals are advanced, based on lasso and ridge selection criteria, and their performance is studied for a number of models. The developed method is shown to provide good accuracy for the calculated quantities.</p>

            <p>We review the condensation completion of a modular tensor category, which yields a fusion 2-category of codimension-1 and higher defects in a $2+1$D topological order. We apply the condensation completion to $2+1$D topological order with $\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_4$ fusion rules. In these cases, we explicitly enumerate the $1$d and $0$d defects present in these topological orders, along with their fusion rules. We also talk about other applications of condensation completion: alternative interpretations of condensation completion of a braided fusion category; condensation completion of the category of symmetry charges and its correspondence to gapped phases with symmetry; for a topological order $\mathcal{C}$, one can also find all gapped boundaries of the stacking of $\mathcal{C}$ with its time-reversal conjugate through computing the condensation completion of $\mathcal{C}$.</p>

            <p>Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) based on spin-1/2 fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States (fPEPS) are considered on the square lattice. First, fPEPS approximants of Gutzwiller-projected Chern insulators (GPCI) are investigated by Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) techniques on finite size tori. We show that such fPEPS of finite bond dimension can correctly capture the topological properties of the chiral spin liquid, as the exact GPCI, with the correct topological ground state degeneracy on the torus. Further, more general fPEPS are considered and optimized (on the infinite plane) to describe the CSL phase of a chiral frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The chiral modes are computed on the edge of a semi-infinite cylinder (of finite circumference) and shown to follow the predictions from Conformal Field Theory. In contrast to their bosonic analogs the (optimized) fPEPS do not suffer from the replication of the chiral edge mode in the odd topological sector.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reko P. S. Penttilä, Kukka-Emilia Huhtinen, Päivi Törmä</p>
            <p>Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the bands as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter, critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature are calculated within dynamical mean-field theory. We find that for isolated flat bands, the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are in general good indicators of superconductivity even at finite temperatures. For non-isolated flat bands, a good guideline of the BKT temperature is provided by the zero-temperature superfluid weight and the flat-band ratio.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional metals, such as graphene, have undergone extensive exploration, with graphene exhibiting a metallic response limited to the infrared spectral range. Overcoming the challenge of extending the electron mobility in two-dimensional metals to achieve plasmonic behaviors in the visible range necessitates innovative synthesis procedures.

Leveraging first-principle density-functional theory alongside advanced deep-subwavelength cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, we reveal the extreme anisotropic response of this material in the visible range, transitioning from hyperbolic polaritonic to an elliptic wavefront. Our calculations substantiate the experimental findings, positioning borophene as an unprecedented candidate for the in-plane hyperbolic response in the visible range. These results open avenues for pioneering optoelectronic applications in the visible spectrum, particularly through the incorporation of borophene into hybrid metallic-semiconducting heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</p>

            <p>In unconventional high-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors, the pair density wave state, an exotic superconducting order showing spatially periodic order parameter modulations with the period of several unit cells and translational symmetry breaking, has attracted broad attention. However, the superconducting pair density modulation within a single unit cell (PDM) has never been carefully investigated before. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the observation of PDM in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001). The superconductivity modulations are characterized by the superconducting gap size and the coherence peak sharpness. Further analysis shows that the local maxima and minima in the superconducting gap modulation are centered at the crystallographic locations of the chalcogen atoms, revealing the breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry of the chalcogen atoms in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films grown on SrTiO3(001). Our findings provide precise microscopic information on superconductivity within the lattice unit cell and may promote the understanding of unconventional high-Tc superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Hierarchical tree structures are common in many real-world systems, from tree roots and branches to neuronal dendrites and biologically inspired artificial neural networks, as well as in technological networks for organizing and searching complex datasets of high-dimensional patterns. Within the class of hierarchical self-organized systems, we investigate the interplay of structure and function, associated with the emergence of complex tree structures in disordered environments. Using an algorithm that creates and searches trees of real-world patterns, our work stands at the intersection of statistical physics, machine learning, and network theory. We resolve the network properties over multiple phase transitions and across a continuity of scales, using the von Neumann entropy, its generalized susceptibility, and the recent definition of thermodynamic-like quantities, such as work, heat, and efficiency. We show that scale-invariance, i.e. power-law Laplacian spectral density, is a key feature to construct trees capable of combining fast information flow and sufficiently rich internal representation of information, enabling the system to achieve its functional task efficiently. Moreover, the complexity of the environmental conditions the system has adapted to is encoded in the value of the exponent of the power-law spectral density, inherently related to the network spectral dimension, and directly influencing the traits of those functionally efficient networks. Thereby, we provide a novel metric to estimate the complexity of high-dimensional datasets.</p>

The observed weak temperature dependence of the detector's performance in the sub-kelvin range fully confirms its phase-diffusion mode of operation. On the other hand, these results show that inevitable thermal fluctuations are not the main source of the detector noise. Consequently, there is still a room to optimize the detector's performance. These results are important for axion search experiments in the range of 5-25 GHz (20-100 $\mu$eV).</p>

            <p>Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit unique properties, expanding opportunities in material design. We investigate MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) in homo- and heterobilayers with different stacking and twist angles. Twisted bilayers introduce Moiré patterns, significantly altering electronic properties. Using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) with range-separated hybrid functionals, we examine 30 MX$_2$ combinations, revealing how stacking and composition influence stability and band gap energy (E$_g$). Notably, the MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure with a 60\textdegree~shift maintains a direct band gap, highlighting its potential for applications. Homobilayers under low-strain conditions exhibit diverse stacking-dependent electronic behaviors, where MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$ transition between direct and indirect band gaps at specific twist angles. MoS$_2$ can even switch between semiconductor and metallic states. Critical twist angles (17.9\textdegree, 42.1\textdegree, 77.9\textdegree, and 102.1\textdegree) in twisted WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ bilayers yield symmetric Moiré patterns with tunable band gaps. Our findings emphasize that controlling heterostructures and twist angles is a powerful strategy for engineering electronic properties, offering a pathway for next-generation materials.</p>

Our measurements are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model that allows us to develop a detailed understanding of the correlated tunneling events. We also demonstrate that the degree of correlations can be controlled by the drive.

            <h2>Emergence of Newtonian Deterministic Causality from Stochastic Motions in Continuous Space and Time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing Miao, Hong Qian, Yong-Shi Wu</p>
            <p>Since Newton's time, deterministic causality has been considered a crucial prerequisite in any fundamental theory in physics. In contrast, the present work investigates stochastic dynamical models for motion in one spatial dimension, in which Newtonian mechanics becomes an emergent property: We present a coherent theory in which a Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE) emerges in a description of the evolution of entropy $-\phi(x,t)=\epsilon \log$(Probability) of a system under observation and in the limit of large information extent $\epsilon^{-1}$ in homogeneous space and time. The variable $\phi$ represents a non-random high-order statistical concept that is distinct from probability itself as $\epsilon=0$; the HJE embodies an emergent law of deterministic causality in continuous space and time with an Imaginary Scale symmetry $(t,x,\phi)\leftrightarrow (it,ix,-i\phi)$. $\phi(x,t)$ exhibits a nonlinear wave phenomenon with a mathematical singularity in finite time, overcoming which we introduce viscosity $\epsilon(\partial^2\phi/\partial x^2)$ and wave $i\epsilon(\partial^2 \phi/\partial x^2)$ perturbations, articulating dissipation and conservation, which break the Imaginary Scale symmetry: They lead to the Brownian motion and Schrödinger's equation of motion, respectively. Last but not least, Lagrange's action in classical mechanics acquires an entropic interpretation and Hamilton's principle is established.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moritz Eissler, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo</p>
            <p>The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable \textit{unraveling parameter} -- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators -- the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.</p>

This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in benchmarked materials and layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</p>

            <p>The major difference between percolation and other phase transition models is the absence of an Hamiltonian and of a partition function. For this reason it is not straightforward to identify the corresponding field theory to be used as starting point of Renormalization Group computations. Indeed, it could be identified with the field theory of $n+1$ states Potts model in the limit of $n \to 0$ only by means of the mapping discovered by Kasteleyn and Fortuin for bond percolation. In this paper we show that it is possible to recover the epsilon expansion for critical exponents in finite dimension directly using the $M$-layer expansion, without the need to perform any analytical continuation. Moreover, we also show explicitly that the critical exponents for site and bond percolation are the same. This computation provides a reference for applications of the $M$-layer method to systems where the underlying field theory is unknown or disputed.</p>

            <h2>Long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Mattes, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo</p>
            <p>Enhanced experimental capabilities to control nonlocal and power-law decaying interactions are currently fuelling intense research in the domain of quantum many-body physics. Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent non-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.</p>

            <h2>Mixing by squirmers in stratified fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaseem A. Shaik, Gwynn J. Elfring</p>
            <p>We find the mixing induced by a small swimming organism in a density stratified fluid. We model the swimmer as a spherical squirmer and quantify mixing through a mixing efficiency that is the ratio of rate of change of potential energy of fluid to the total work done by the swimmer. Assessing mixing in the near field and far field of the swimmer separately, we find that the near-field mixing aligns with past work, but the overall mixing is much larger than that caused by a point-sized swimmer (like force-dipole), although still small in weak stratification. Equivalent results are also obtained for a homogeneous dilute suspension of non-interacting swimmers. Our study highlights the impact of swimmer size on mixing, revealing that small-sized swimmers cannot induce substantial mixing. However, we propose few (unexplored) pathways through which small swimmers could induce significant mixing, ultimately contributing towards oceanic mixing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michał Balcerek, Adrian Pacheco-Pozo, Agnieszka Wyłomanska, Krzysztof Burnecki, Diego Krapf</p>
            <p>Brownian motion in one or more dimensions is extensively used as a stochastic process to model natural and engineering signals, as well as financial data. Most works dealing with multidimensional Brownian motion consider the different dimensions as independent components. In this article, we investigate a model of correlated Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not necessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the process under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the second moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of turning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting characteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to applications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the financial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's 500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the model can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change over time.</p>

            <h2>Information-entropy-driven generation of material-agnostic datasets for machine-learning interatomic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aparna P. A. Subramanyam, Danny Perez</p>
            <p>In contrast to their empirical counterparts, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) promise to deliver near-quantum accuracy over broad regions of configuration space. However, due to their generic functional forms and extreme flexibility, they can catastrophically fail to capture the properties of novel, out-of-sample configurations, making the quality of the training set a determining factor, especially when investigating materials under extreme conditions. We propose a novel automated dataset generation method based on the maximization of the information entropy of the feature distribution, aiming at an extremely broad coverage of the configuration space in a way that is agnostic to the properties of specific target materials. The ability of the dataset to capture unique material properties is demonstrated on a range of unary materials, including elements with the fcc (Al), bcc (W), hcp (Be, Re and Os), graphite (C), and trigonal (Sb, Te) ground states. MLIAPs trained to this dataset are shown to be accurate over a range of application-relevant metrics, as well as extremely robust over very broad swaths of configurations space, even without dataset fine-tuning or hyper-parameter optimization, making the approach extremely attractive to rapidly and autonomously develop general-purpose MLIAPs suitable for simulations in extreme conditions.</p>

            <h2>Minimal work protocols for inertial particles in non-harmonic traps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Sanders, Marco Baldovin, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi</p>
            <p>Progress in miniaturized technology allows us to control physical systems at nanoscale with remarkable precision. Experimental advancements have sparked interest in control problems in stochastic thermodynamics, typically concerning a time-dependent potential applied to a nanoparticle to reach a target stationary state in a given time with minimal energy cost. We study this problem for a particle subject to thermal fluctuations in a regime that takes into account the effects of inertia, and, building on the results of a previous work, provide a numerical method to find optimal controls even for non-Gaussian initial and final conditions, corresponding to non-harmonic confinements. The control protocol and the time-dependent position distribution are qualitatively different from the corresponding overdamped limit: in particular, a symmetry of the boundary conditions, which is preserved in the absence of inertia, turns out to be broken in the underdamped regime. We also show that the momentum mean tends to a constant value along the trajectory, except close to the boundary, while the evolution of the position mean and of the second moments is highly non-trivial. Our results also support that the lower bound on the optimal entropy production computed from the overdamped case is tight in the adiabatic limit.</p>

            <p>Machine Learning (ML) is accelerating the progress of materials prediction and classification, with particular success in CGNN designs. While classical ML methods remain accessible, advanced deep networks are still challenging to build and train. We introduce two new adaptations and refine two existing ML networks for generic crystalline quantum materials properties prediction and optimization. These new models achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting TQC classification and strong performance in predicting band gaps, magnetic classifications, formation energies, and symmetry group. All networks easily generalize to all quantum crystalline materials property predictions. To support this, full implementations and automated methods for data handling and materials predictions are provided, facilitating the use of deep ML methods in quantum materials science. Finally, dataset error rates are analyzed using an ensemble model to identify and highlight highly atypical materials for further investigations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zebedeus Osseweijer, Lumen Eek, Anouar Moustaj, Mikael Fremling, Cristiane Morais Smith</p>
            <p>We investigate the topological phases of the Haldane model on the Sierpiński gasket. As a consequence of the fractal geometry, multiple fractal gaps arise. Additionally, a flat band appears, and due to a complex next-nearest neighbour hopping, this band splits and multiple topological flux-induced gaps emerge. Owing to the fractal nature of the model, conventional momentum-space topological invariants cannot be used. Therefore, we characterise the system's topology in terms of a real-space Chern number. In addition, we verify the robustness of the topological states to disorder. Finally, we present phase diagrams for both a fractal gap and a flux-induced gap. Previous work on a similar system claims that fractality "squeezes" the well-known Haldane phase diagram. However, this result arises because a doubled system was considered with two Sierpiński gaskets glued together. We consider only a single copy of the Sierpiński gasket, keeping global self-similarity. In contrast with these previous results, we find intricate and complex patterns in the phase diagram of this single fractal. Our work shows that the fractality of the model greatly influences the phase space of these structures, and can drive topological phases in the multitude of fractal and flux-induced gaps, providing a richer platform than a conventional integer dimensional geometry.</p>

            <h2>Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Friedrich Hübner, Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</p>

            <p>Lanthanum-hydrogen system and its derivatives remain among the most promising for achieving room-temperature superconductivity. In this study, we examined the formation of ternary lanthanum-scandium superhydrides at pressures up to 220 GPa. The primary product of the LaSc alloy's reaction with hydrogen is newly discovered cubic (La,Sc)H$_{12}$, demonstrating clear superconducting transition in all six channels of the van der Pauw scheme below 244-248 K. In this compound with an unusually large unit cell volume, virtually no magnetoresistance was observed in fields up to 68 Tesla. Synthesized samples of (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ demonstrate pronounced superconducting diode and SQUID-like effects at a record high temperature of 233 K. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the formation of lower hexagonal polyhydrides (La,Sc)H$_{6-7}$, which could potentially account for the anomaly in electrical resistance observed near 274 K. This anomaly between 265-290 K also appears in the radio-frequency transmission measurements and may be of a superconducting nature.</p>

            <p>Synthesizing distinct phases and controlling the crystalline defects in them are key concepts in materials and process design. These approaches are usually described by decoupled theories, with the former resting on equilibrium thermodynamics and the latter on nonequilibrium kinetics. By combining them into a holistic form of defect phase diagrams, we can apply phase equilibrium models to the thermodynamic evaluation of defects such as vacancies, dislocations, surfaces, grain boundaries, and phase boundaries, placing the understanding of material imperfections and their role on properties on solid thermodynamic and theoretical grounds. In this study, we characterize an interface-stabilized phase between Fe and Fe3O4 (magnetite) with differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This method uniquely enables the simultaneous imaging of both heavy Fe atoms and light O atoms, providing precise mapping of the atomic structure and chemical composition at this heterogeneous metal-oxide interface. We identify a well-ordered two-layer interface-stabilized phase state (referred to as complexion) at the Fe[001]/Fe3O4[001] interface. Using density-functional theory (DFT), we not only explain the observed complexion but also map out various interface-stabilized phases as a function of the O chemical potential. We show that the formation of complexions influences the properties of the interface, increasing its adhesion by 20 % and changing the charge transfer between adjacent materials, also leveraging impact on the transport properties across such interfaces. Our findings highlight the potential of tunable phase states at defects as a new asset in advanced materials design, paving the way for knowledge-based and optimized corrosion protection, catalysis, magnetism, and redox-driven phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has played an important role in many topological and correlated electron materials. In graphene-based systems, SOC induced by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) at proximity was shown to drive topological states and strengthen superconductivity. However, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a robust platform for electron correlation and topology, superconductivity and the role of SOC remain largely unexplored. Here we report transport measurements of TMD-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG). We observed a new hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with Tc = 230 mK. On the electron-doped side, we identified a new isospin-symmetry breaking three-quarter-metal (TQM) phase and observed the nearby weak superconducting state SC3 is significantly enhanced. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare RTG is strongly suppressed in the presence of TMD - opposite to the effect of SOC on all other graphene superconductivities. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices.</p>

            <p>We introduce a family of (semi) bold-line series, assisted with $1/\text{N}_{f}$ expansions, with $\text{N}_{f}$ being the number of fermion flavours. If there is no additional $\mathrm{N}_{f}$ cut, the series reduces to the RPA series in the density-density channel, complementary to the particle-hole and particle-particle channels introduced in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{102}, 195122]. We performed extensive benchmarks for density, energy and pressure with $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{t}'$ $\mathrm{SU}(\mathrm{N}_{f})$ Hubbard model on square lattice and honeycomb lattices over a wide range of numerical methods. For benchmark purposes, we also implement bare-$\mathrm{U}$ symmetry-broken perturbation series for the 2D SU(2) Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. We find difficulties simulating grand potentials with different shift parameters even at high temperatures and weak interactions, while in general find encouraging results for density simulations. We believe the search for optimal shift parameters is feasible, while we leave this problem for future studies. Nevertheless, the $1/\mathrm{N}_{f}$ series could proves efficacious for grand potential computations where symmetry broken bare-U expansion grapples with considerable challenges.</p>

            <p>Stabilizing $Z_2$ fluxes in Kitaev spin liquids (KSLs) is crucial for both characterizing candidate materials and identifying Ising anyons. In this study, we investigate the effects of spin-$S$ magnetic impurities embedded in the spin-1/2 KSL. Utilizing exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods, we examine the impurity magnetization and ground-state flux sector with varying impurity coupling and spin size. Our findings reveal that impurity magnetization exhibits an integer/half-integer spin dependence, which aligns with analytical predictions, and a flux-sector transition from bound-flux to zero-flux occurs at low coupling strengths, independent of the impurity spin. Notably, for spin-3/2 impurities, we observe a reentrant bound-flux sector, which remains stable under magnetic fields. By considering fermionic representations of our spin Hamiltonian, we provide phenomenological explanations for the transitions. Our results suggest a novel way of binding a flux in KSLs, beyond the proposals of vacancies or Kondo impurities.</p>

            <p>Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently large.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armin Aminimajd, Joao Maia, Abhinendra Singh</p>
            <p>Dense suspensions often exhibit shear thickening, characterized by a dramatic increase in viscosity under large external forcing. This behavior has recently been linked to the formation of a system-spanning frictional contact network (FCN), which contributes to increased resistance during deformation. However, identifying these frictional contacts poses experimental challenges and is computationally expensive. This study introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to accurately predict FCNs in two dimensional simulations of dense shear thickening suspensions. The results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the GNN model across various stress levels $(\sigma)$, packing fractions$(\phi)$, system sizes, particle size ratios$(\Delta)$, and amount of smaller particles. The model is further able to predict both the occurrence and structure of the FCN. The presented model is accurate and interpolates and extrapolates to conditions far from its control parameters. This machine learning approach provides an accurate, lower cost, and faster predictions of suspension properties compared to conventional methods, while it is trained using only small systems. Ultimately, the findings in this study pave the way for predicting frictional contact networks in real-life large-scale polydisperse suspensions, for which theoretical models are largely limited owing to computational challenges.</p>

            <p>We unravel the existence and stability properties of one-dimensional droplets arising in genuine two-component particle imbalanced bosonic mixtures under the influence of a weak harmonic confinement. A plethora of miscible droplet phases is found with the majority component atoms in the vicinity of the minority ones assembling in a droplet configuration while the remaining excess atoms being in the gas state. Our computations identify a transition from a bound to a trapped gas many-body state for increasing total atom number and fixed interactions, with the bound character being prolonged for stronger intercomponent attractions. Spectral stability of these two-component droplets is revealed by examining their underlying Bogoliubov-de-Gennes excitation spectrum. Furthermore, the collective dynamics associated with the fundamental dipole and breathing modes of the system is monitored by suddenly shifting the trap's center or quenching the trap's frequency, respectively. There, a back action of the significantly localized minority component is imprinted in the majority cloud. The present findings can be simulated in recent cold-atom experiments, thus setting the stage for probing the complex nonequilibrium dynamics of two-component droplets.</p>

            <p>Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</p>

            <p>This article studies the dynamics of the mean-field approximation of continuous random networks. These networks are stochastic integrodifferential equations driven by Gaussian noise. The kernels in the integral operators are realizations of generalized Gaussian random variables. The equation controls the time evolution of a macroscopic state interpreted as neural activity, which depends on position and time. The position is an element of a measurable space. Such a network corresponds to a statistical field theory (STF) given by a momenta-generating functional. Discrete versions of the mentioned networks appeared in spin glasses and as models of artificial neural networks (NNs). Each of these discrete networks corresponds to a lattice SFT, where the action contains a finite number of neurons and two scalar fields for each neuron. In this article, we develop mathematically rigorous, continuous versions of the mean-field theory approximation and the double-copy system that allow us to derive a condition for the criticality of continuous stochastic networks via the largest Lyapunov exponent. We use two basic architectures; in the first one, the space of neurons is the real line, and then the neurons are organized in one layer; in the second one, the space of neurons is the p-adic line, and then the neurons are organized in an infinite, fractal, tree-like structure. We also studied a toy model of a continuous Gaussian network with a continuous phase transition. This behavior matches the critical brain hypothesis, which states that certain biological neuronal networks work near phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Point processes have broad applications in science and engineering. In physics, their use ranges from quantum chaos to statistical mechanics of many-particle systems. We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. As a physical application, we describe the spontaneous vortex formation during Bose-Einstein condensation in finite time recently studied in ultracold atom experiments and use the SFF to reveal the stochastic geometry of the resulting vortex patterns. In closing, we also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.</p>

            <p>It is well-known that the proximity effect at superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) interfaces produces damped oscillatory behavior of the Cooper pair wave function within the ferromagnetic regions, which is analogous to the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity. It is often called the mesoscopic FFLO state and gives rise to $0-\pi$-transitions in S/F/S Josephson junctions. This paper offers an analysis of the proximity effect at interfaces between superconductors and magnetic van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. The specific feature of the proximity effect in the vdW bilayer systems is the presence of non-local Cooper pairs. We predict that the mesoscopic FFLO state formed by such pairs is sensitive to the difference between on-site energies of the monolayers composing the bilayer and, thus, can be controlled by applying a gating potential to one of the monolayers. This opens the possibility of implementing gate-controlled $0-\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions through the magnetic vdW bilayer weak links.</p>

We construct the network of domain walls using the spectral localizer as a ``topological landscape function'', and obtain the thermal metal--insulator phase diagram from the percolation transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Behjatian, Ralf Blossey, Madhavi Krishnan</p>
            <p>Electrostatics in the solution phase is governed by free electrical charges such as ions, as well as by bound charges that arise when a polarizable medium responds to an applied field. In a local medium, described by a constant dielectric permittivity, the sign of the far-field electrostatic potential distribution around an object is governed by its electrical charge. We demonstrate significant departures from this expectation in a nonlocal medium characterized by a wave vector-dependent dielectric function. Here, surface polarization due to the solvent, or indeed non-solvent dipoles, may wield significant influence at large distances. The polarization correlation length may not only significantly augment the effective screening length, but we also show that the electrical contribution from polarization can compete with and even invert the sign of the electrical potential and the field arising from charge alone. These results hold ramifications for a range of apparently anomalous electrically governed observations such as underscreening, electrophoretic mobilities of charge-neutral objects, and long-ranged attraction between like-charged entities in water and other solvents.</p>

            <p>The control of wave scattering in complex non-Hermitian settings is an exciting subject -- often challenging the creativity of researchers and stimulating the imagination of the public. Successful outcomes include invisibility cloaks, wavefront shaping protocols, active metasurface development, and more. At their core, these achievements rely on our ability to engineer the resonant spectrum of the underlying physical structures which is conventionally accomplished by carefully imposing geometrical and/or dynamical symmetries. In contrast, by taking active control over the boundary conditions in complex scattering environments which lack artificially-imposed geometric symmetries, we demonstrate via microwave experiments the ability to manipulate the spectrum of the scattering operator. This active control empowers the creation, destruction and repositioning of exceptional point degeneracies (EPD's) in a two-dimensional (2D) parameter space. The presence of EPD's signifies a coalescence of the scattering eigenmodes, which dramatically affects transport. The scattering EPD's are partitioned in domains characterized by a binary charge, as well as an integer winding number, are topologically stable in the two-dimensional parameter space, and obey winding number-conservation laws upon interactions with each other, even in cases where Lorentz reciprocity is violated; in this case the topological domains are destroyed. Ramifications of this understanding is the proposition for a unique input-magnitude and phase-insensitive 50:50 in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) power splitter. Our study establishes an important step towards complete control of scattering processes in complex non-Hermitian settings.</p>

            <h2>Universally optimizable strategy for magnetic gaps towards high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall states via magnetic-insulator/topological-insulator building-blocks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Li, Feng Xue, Xin-Yi Tang, Xiyu Hong, Yang Chen, Xiao Feng, Ke He</p>
            <p>Optimizing the magnetic Zeeman-splitting term, specifically the magnetic gap of the topological surface states (TSSs), is a crucial issue and central challenge in advancing higher-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In this work, we demonstrate a counterintuitive, nonmonotonic relationship between the magnetic gap and the hybridization strength in ferromagnetic-insulator (FMI)/topological-insulator (TI) sandwich structures. Concretely, insufficient hybridization strength fails to induce a substantial magnetic gap; while excessive hybridization incandesces the competition between kinetic and Coulomb exchange interactions, thereby reducing the gap. Strong hybridization strength also spatially delocalizes the TSSs, diminishing the effective orbital coupling between TSS-based p and magnetic d orbitals, which further weakens kinetic and Coulomb exchange interaction strength. Moreover, modifying the stacking order offers an experimentally viable approach to optimizing magnetic gaps, enabling the tunability of Chern numbers, chirality and maximizing global gaps. These findings unveil a universal guiding principle for optimizing magnetic gaps in FMI-TI proximity-based QAH systems, offering valuable insights for advancing experimental implementations in this field.</p>

            <h2>Objective Moir\'e Pattern</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Feng</p>
            <p>Moiré patterns, typically formed by overlaying two layers of two-dimensional materials, exhibit an effective long-range periodicity that depends on the short-range periodicity of each layer and their spatial misalignment. Here, we study moiré patterns in objective structures with symmetries different from those in conventional patterns such as twisted bilayer graphene. Specifically, the mathematical descriptions for ring patterns, 2D Bravais lattice patterns, and helical patterns are derived analytically as representative examples of objective moiré patterns, using an augmented Fourier approach. Our findings reveal that the objective moiré patterns retain the symmetries of their original structures but with different parameters. In addition, we present a non-objective case, conformal moiré patterns, to demonstrate the versatility of this approach. We hope this geometric framework will provide insights for solving more complex moiré patterns and facilitate the application of moiré patterns in X-ray diffractions, wave manipulations, molecular dynamics, and other fields.</p>

            <p>We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger--Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the convergence in the number of form factors depends on the channel representation of the SDE. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling, the pseudogap opening driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations is captured already by a single ($s$-wave) form factor in the magnetic channel representation, differently to the density and superconducting channels.</p>

            <h2>Structure of Quantum Mean Force Gibbs States for Coupled Harmonic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joonhyun Yeo, Haena Shim</p>
            <p>An open quantum system interacting with a heat bath at given temperature is expected to reach the mean force Gibbs (MFG) state as a steady state. The MFG state is given by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom from the equilibrium Gibbs state of the total system plus bath. When the interaction between the system and the bath is not negligible, it is different from the usual system Gibbs state obtained from the system Hamiltonian only. Using the path integral method, we present the exact MFG state for a coupled system of quantum harmonic oscillators in contact with multiple thermal baths at the same temperature. We develop a nonperturbative method to calculate the covariances with respect to the MFG state. By comparing them with those obtained from the system Gibbs state, we find that the effect of coupling to the bath decays exponentially as a function of the distance from the system-bath boundary. This is similar to the skin effect found recently for a quantum spin chain interacting with an environment. Using the exact results, we also investigate the ultrastrong coupling limit where the coupling between the system and the bath gets arbitrarily large and make a connection with the recent result found for a general quantum system.</p>

            <p>Nano-constriction spin-Hall nano-oscillators (NC-SHNOs) have garnered considerable interest due to their potential use as efficient and adjustable nano-sized sources of microwave signals, with high-frequency tunability, adaptable design layout, and CMOS compatibility. In order to facilitate system- and circuit-level designs based on the NC-SHNOs, it is essential to have an analytical model capable of predicting the behavior of the NC-SHNO. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model to describe the frequency behavior of a single NC-SHNO in an in-plane magnetic field while considering the Oersted field. The model is divided into two regions based on the direct current value: the "linear-like" and "bullet" modes. Each region is characterized by distinct concepts and equations. The first region, the "linear-like mode," emerges from the nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area of the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized "bullet mode," exhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a decrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO, and the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Giant Nonvolatile Multistate Resistance with Fully Magnetically Controlled in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Yan, Xujin Zhang, Jianhua Xiao, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu</p>
            <p>Ferroelectric polarization switching in electrically controlled van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) causes atomic migration, compromising device stability and fatigue resistance. Here we propose a fully magnetically controlled vdW-MFTJ based on a \(\mathrm{CrBr_3/MnPSe_3/CrBr_3}\) vertical heterostructure, which achieves ferroelectric polarization reversal without relying on atomic migration driven by inversion symmetry breaking. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Orientation-dependent transport in junctions formed by $d$-wave altermagnets and $d$-wave superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjun Zhao, Yuri Fukaya, Pablo Burset, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu</p>
            <p>We investigate de Gennes-Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. Even though these states are associated to long junctions, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet in a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction forms de Gennes-Saint-James states in a short junction due to an enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors. As a result, the zero-bias conductance peak vanishes and pronounced resonance spikes emerge in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the $d_{xy}$-altermagnet only features de Gennes-Saint-James states in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I(\varphi)$ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi$ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.</p>

            <h2>Selective enhancement of Coulomb interactions in planar Weyl fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vadym Apalkov, Wenchen Luo, Tapash Chakraborty</p>
            <p>We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.</p>

            <p>We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</p>

            <h2>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The field theory for FL*-FL quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder is mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations. The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</p>

            <p>Titanium nitride (TiN) is widely used as a protective coating due to its high hardness, but suffers from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting its applicability. The layering of TiN films with metallic titanium (Ti) improves the overall fracture behaviour of the architecture by modifying the crack driving force due to elastic-plastic mismatch between the layers. Microcantilever fracture tests were carried out on bilayer (Ti-TiN, TiN-Ti) and trilayer (Ti-TiN-Ti) architectures to determine the fracture toughness and study the fundamental crack growth behaviour. The initiation fracture toughness in bilayer architecture with crack in Ti layer is almost 70% higher, when compared to crack in TiN layer. In Ti-TiN bilayer the crack propagated catastrophically post linear elastic deformation, whereas the crack was arrested at the TiN/Ti interface in both TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures due to plastic energy dissipation in the Ti layer. Crack tip plasticity originated in the metallic Ti layer in TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures increased the total fracture resistance by more than eight-fold compared to the Ti-TiN bilayer.</p>

In particular, we show (a) how to combine neural networks (NNs), trained with data from MC simulations of Ising-type spin models on finite lattices, with FSS to obtain both thermal magnetic exponents $y_t = 1/\nu$ and $y_h$, respectively, at both critical and tricritical points, (b) how to obtain the NN counterpart of two-scale-factor universality at an Ising-type critical point, and (c) FSS at a first-order transition.

            <p>The breaking of detailed balance in fluids through Coriolis forces or odd-viscous stresses has profound effects on the dynamics of surface waves. Here we explore both weakly and strongly non-linear waves in a three-dimensional fluid with vertical odd viscosity with and without the Coriolis effect. Our model describes the free surface of a shallow fluid composed of nearly vertical vortex filaments, which all stand perpendicular to the surface. We find that the odd viscosity in this configuration induces previously unexplored non-linear effects in shallow-water waves, arising from both stresses on the surface and stress gradients in the bulk. By assuming weak nonlinearity, we find reduced equations including Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Ostrovsky, and Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli (KP) equations with modified coefficients. At sufficiently large odd viscosity, the dispersion changes sign, allowing for compact two-dimensional solitary waves. We show that odd viscosity and surface tension have the same effect on the free surface, but distinct signatures in the fluid flow. Our results describe the collective dynamics of many-vortex systems, which can also occur in oceanic and atmospheric geophysics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Suzuki, Jonas Haferkamp, Jens Eisert, Philippe Faist</p>
            <p>Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>One of the demanding frontiers in ultracold quantum science is identifying laser cooling schemes for complex atoms and molecules out of their vast spectra of internal states. Motivated by the prospect of expanding the set of available ultracold molecules for applications in fundamental physics, chemistry, astrochemistry, and quantum simulation, we propose and demonstrate an automated graph-based search approach for viable laser cooling schemes. The method is time efficient, reproduces the results of previous manual searches, and reveals a plethora of new potential laser cooling schemes. We discover laser cooling schemes for YO, C$_2$, OH$^+$, CN, and CO$_2$, including surprising schemes that start from highly excited states or do not rely on a strong main transition. A central insight of this work is that the reinterpretation of quantum states and transitions between them as a graph can dramatically enhance the ability to identify new quantum control schemes for complex quantum systems. As such, this approach will also apply to complex atoms and, in fact, any complex many-body quantum system with a discrete spectrum of internal states.</p>

            <h2>Making Sense of Gravitational Thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Lorenzetti</p>
            <p>The use of statistical methods to model gravitational systems is crucial to physics practice, but the extent to which thermodynamics and statistical mechanics genuinely apply to these systems is a contentious issue. This paper provides new conceptual foundations for gravitational thermodynamics by reconsidering the nature of key concepts like equilibrium and advancing a novel way of understanding thermodynamics. The challenges arise from the peculiar characteristics of the gravitational potential, leading to non-extensive energy and entropy, negative heat capacity, and a lack of standard equilibrium. Hence it has been claimed that only non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is warranted in this domain, whereas thermodynamics is inapplicable. We argue instead that equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to self-gravitating systems at the relevant scale, as they display equilibrium in the form of metastable quasi-equilibrium states. We then develop a minimal framework for thermodynamics that can be applied to these systems and beyond. Thermodynamics applies in the sense that we can devise macroscopic descriptions and explanations of the behaviour of these systems in terms of coarse-grained quantities like energy and temperature within equilibrium statistical mechanics.</p>

            <p>In a physical system with conformal symmetry, observables depend on cross-ratios, measures of distance invariant under global conformal transformations (conformal geometry for short). We identify a quantum information-theoretic mechanism by which the conformal geometry emerges at the gapless edge of a 2+1D quantum many-body system with a bulk energy gap. We introduce a novel pair of information-theoretic quantities $(\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}, \eta)$ that can be defined locally on the edge from the wavefunction of the many-body system, without prior knowledge of any distance measure. We posit that, for a topological groundstate, the quantity $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is stationary under arbitrary variations of the quantum state, and study the logical consequences. We show that stationarity, modulo an entanglement-based assumption about the bulk, implies (i) $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is a non-negative constant that can be interpreted as the total central charge of the edge theory. (ii) $\eta$ is a cross-ratio, obeying the full set of mathematical consistency rules, which further indicates the existence of a distance measure of the edge with global conformal invariance. Thus, the conformal geometry emerges from a simple assumption on groundstate entanglement. We show that stationarity of $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is equivalent to a vector fixed-point equation involving $\eta$, making our assumption locally checkable. We also derive similar results for 1+1D systems under a suitable set of assumptions.</p>

            <p>Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anh Q. Nguyen, Junxiang Huang, Dapeng Bi</p>
            <p>During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.</p>

            <p>The inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity in the BPS limit is studied for both relativistic and nonrelativistic regimes. Though the symmetry of spatial translation is broken by inhomogeneity, extension to an $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theory is admitted. The quartic scalar potential has minimum value depending on strength of the impurity but possesses broken phase at spatial asymptote. The vacuum configuration of broken phase can be neither a constant nor the minimum of the scalar potential, but is found as a nontrivial solution of the Bogomolny equations. While its energy density and magnetic field are given by the function of spatial coordinates, the energy and magnetic flux remain zero. The sign of the magnetic impurity term allows either a BPS sector or anti-BPS sector but not both. Thus the obtained solution is identified as the new inhomogeneous broken vacuum of minimum zero energy. In the presence of rotationally symmetric Gaussian type inhomogeneity, topological vortex solutions are also obtained and the effects of the impurity to the vortex are numerically analyzed.</p>

            <h2>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolyn Zhang, Yichen Xu, Jian-Hao Zhang, Cenke Xu, Zhen Bi, Zhu-Xi Luo</p>
            <p>Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a Rényi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, & Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite Rényi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</p>

            <h2>High-performance conditional-driving gate for Kerr parametric oscillator qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroomi Chono, Hayato Goto</p>
            <p>Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonators, can stably hold coherent states with opposite-sign amplitudes and are promising devices for quantum computing. Recently, we have theoretically proposed a two-qubit gate $R_{zz}$ for highly detuned KPOs and called it a conditional-driving gate [Chono $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Res. $\textbf{4}$, 043054 (2022)]. In this study, analyzing its superconducting-circuit model and deriving a corresponding static model, we find that an AC-Zeeman shift due to the flux pulse for the gate operation largely affects the gate performance. This effect becomes a more aggravating factor with shorter gate times, leading to an increase in the error rate. We thus propose a method to cancel this undesirable effect. Furthermore, through the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity and the optimization of flux pulses, we numerically demonstrate a conditional-driving gate with average fidelity exceeding 99.9$\%$ twice faster than that without the proposed method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bijit Mukherjee, Jeremy M. Hutson</p>
            <p>We investigate the prospect of using ultracold alkali diatomic molecules to implement many-body quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry. Experimentally accessible molecules offer large $N$ for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with both attractive and repulsive interactions. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations on pairs of NaK, NaRb and NaCs molecules that are shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields. We develop new methods to handle the very large basis sets required to include nuclear spins. We show that all the molecules studied have the properties required for SU($N$) symmetry: the collisions are principally elastic, and the scattering lengths depend only weakly on the spin states of the molecules. The rates of spin-changing inelastic collisions are very low. We develop and test a semiclassical model of the spin dependence and find that it performs well.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Sanders, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi</p>
            <p>Optimal control theory aims to find an optimal protocol to steer a system between assigned boundary conditions while minimizing a given cost functional in finite time. Equations arising from these types of problems are often non-linear and difficult to solve numerically. In this note, we describe numerical methods of integration for two partial differential equations that commonly arise in optimal control theory: the Fokker-Planck equation driven by a mechanical potential for which we use Girsanov theorem; and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman, or dynamic programming, equation for which we find the gradient of its solution using the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. The computation of the gradient is necessary to specify the optimal protocol. Finally, we give an example application of the numerical techniques to solving an optimal control problem without spacial discretization using machine learning.</p>

            <p>In this work, we develop an analytical framework to understand quantum friction across distinct stability regimes, providing approximate expressions for frictional forces both in the deep stable regime and near the critical threshold of instability. Our primary finding is analytical proof that, near the instability threshold, the quantum friction force diverges logarithmically. This result, verified through numerical simulations, sheds light on the behavior of frictional instabilities as the system approaches criticality. Our findings offer new insights into the role of instabilities, critical divergence and temperature in frictional dynamics across quantum and classical regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui-Huang Chen, Zi-Jun Tang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time (the time when the vanishing entanglement asymmetry begins to grow). This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanishing entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyun-Sik Jeong, Arnab Kundu, Juan F. Pedraza</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</p>

            <p>Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model refines itself from its own predictions, has garnered attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD in binary classification tasks with noisy labeled Gaussian mixture data, utilizing a replica theory. Our findings reveals that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate the efficacy of practical heuristics, such as early stopping for extracting meaningful signal and bias fixation for imbalanced data. These results provide both theoretical guarantees and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</p>

            <p>We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Succi, M. Lauricella, A. Tiribocchi</p>
            <p>Recent experiments of fluid transport in nano-channels have shown evidence of a dramatic reduction of friction due to the coupling between charge-fluctuations in polar fluids and electronic excitations in graphene solids, a phenomenon dubbed "negative quantum friction". In this paper, we present a semi-classical mesoscale Boltzmann-Wigner lattice kinetic model of quantum-nanoscale transport and perform a numerical study of the effects of the quantum interactions on the evolution of a one-dimensional nano-fluid subject to a periodic external potential. It is shown that the effects of quantum fluctuations become visible once the quantum length scale (Fermi wavelength) of the quasiparticles becomes comparable to the wavelength of the external potential. Under such conditions, quantum fluctuations are mostly felt on the odd kinetic moments, while the even ones remain nearly unaffected because they are "protected" by thermal fluctuations. It is hoped that the present Boltzmann-Wigner lattice model and extensions thereof may offer a useful tool for the computer simulation of quantum-nanofluidic transport phenomena.</p>

We present a hybrid approach combining EOM-CCSD with the computationally efficient $GW$ approximation to estimate thermodynamic limit band gaps for several insulators and semiconductors. Our method substantially reduces required cell sizes while maintaining accuracy. Comparisons with experimental gaps and self-consistent $GW$ calculations reveal that deviations in EOM-CCSD predictions correlate with reduced single excitation character of the excited many-electron states. Our work not only provides a computationally tractable approach to EOM-CC calculations in solids but also reveals fundamental insights into the role of single excitations in electronic-structure theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Boesl, Yu-Jie Liu, Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Phases with topological order exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: States with the same topological order are distinguished by how their anyonic excitations transform under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological phases. In this work, we develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune between wavefunctions of different symmetry fractionalization. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are completely immobile as individual particles. By deforming the local tensors that describe the ground state of the fixed point model, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions have non-vanishing correlation lengths and are non-stabilizer states. At the critical points between the phases, power-law correlations are supported in certain spatial directions. Furthermore, based on the isoTNS description of the wavefunction, we determine a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme for which a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays suffices to encode the three-dimensional state using measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order based on the language of tensor networks and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order with quantum processors.</p>

The unique properties of polar metals challenge expectations, making way for the exploration of exotic phenomena such as unconventional magnetism, hyperferroelectric multiferroicity and developing multifunctional devices that can leverage both the materials electric polarization and its asymmetry in the spin conductivity, that arises due to the Rashba effect. Here, via a high pressure single crystal diffraction study, we report the pressure-induced enhancement of polar distortions in such a metal, Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Our DFT calculations highlight that naive assumptions about the linear dependency between polar distortion amplitudes and the magnitude of the Rashba spin splitting may not be generally valid.</p>

            <p>Artificial magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry in engineered materials--also known as metamaterials, enabling robust, topological transport of neutral excitations, much like electronic conduction edge channels in the integer quantum Hall effect. We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of quantum-Hall-like chiral edge states in optomechanical resonator networks. Synthetic magnetic fields for phononic excitations are induced through laser drives, while cavity optomechanical control allows full reconfigurability of the effective metamaterial response of the networks, including programming of magnetic fluxes in multiple resonator plaquettes. By tuning the interplay between network connectivity and magnetic fields, we demonstrate both flux-sensitive and flux-insensitive localized mechanical states. Scaling up the system creates spectral features that are precursors to Hofstadter butterfly spectra. Site-resolved spectroscopy reveals edge-bulk separation, with stationary phononic distributions signaling chiral edge modes. We directly probe those edge modes in transport measurements to demonstrate a unidirectional acoustic channel.

            <p>The interaction between intense light-matter not only promotes emerging applications in quantum and nonlinear optics but also facilitates changes in material properties. Plasmons can significantly enhance not only molecular chirality but also the coupling strength. In this study, we investigate the coupling dichroism in a strongly coupled chiral molecule-plasmonic nanoparticle system using RT-TDDFT. By simulating the interaction between L/D- Phenylglycinol molecules and chiral aluminum clusters (Na-doped Al197Na4), we examine the effects of molecular chirality, cluster chirality, and the coupled effect in the system. Our results demonstrate that the achiral/chiral clusters induce significant spectral shifts and enhance molecular CD signals due to strong plasmon-molecule coupling. The electric-field distribution and transition contribution maps (TCMs) reveal the formation of bonding and antibonding polaritonic modes, modulated by molecular proximity to the cluster. Both of the coupling factor and decay rate of the coupled system will be modulated by the chirality of the molecules and the cluster. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of coupled molecules leads to a substantial increase in the intensity of lower polaritonic modes, highlighting the collective behavior in multi-molecule systems due to the modal crosstalk or resonance between cluster chirality and molecular chirality. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing plasmon-enhanced chirality at the atomic scale, which have implications for the design of highly sensitive chiral sensors and optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</p>

            <p>Time reversal symmetry breaking is an important piece in controlling nonreciprocal responses which are crucial in advancing the utility of quantum materials in device operations. Here, we propose cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonreciprocities where time reversal breaking is achieved via chirality of the cavity modes. With twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as an example, we demonstrate the general principles of cavity control of band dispersion and geometry using chiral microwave photons which are valid for modes in a split-ring resonator or for modes emulated on a qubit lattice. In particular, we show that time reversal breaking by chiral modes enables superconducting diode-like nonlinearities in TBG by valley polarized states and their skewed quantum geometry. Strikingly, we find sizeable nonreciprocities at par with those obtained in magnetic field trained TBG Jospephson junction devices. The cavity control of superconducting nonreciprocities offers non-invasive means of exploring new functionalities in quantum circuits with in-situ implementation. This can serve as an important contribution to the toolbox for nonreciprocal models in circuit quantum electrodynamics to be harnessed for quantum computing and sensing.</p>

            <p>The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.</p>

Based on electron-hole bilayers made of MoSe2/hBN/WSe2 heterostructures, here we study the behavior of excitonic insulators in a perpendicular magnetic field. We report the observation of excitonic quantum oscillations in both Coulomb drag signals and electrical resistance at low to medium magnetic fields. Under a strong magnetic field, we identify multiple quantum phase transitions between the excitonic insulator phase and the bilayer quantum Hall insulator phase. These findings underscore the interplay between the electron-hole interactions and Landau level quantization that opens new possibilities for exploring quantum phenomena in composite bosonic insulators.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals magnets are an emergent material class of paramount interest for fundamental studies in coupling light with matter excitations, which are uniquely linked to their underlying magnetic properties. Among these materials, the magnetic semiconductor CrSBr is possibly a first playground where we can study simultaneously the interaction of photons, magnons, and excitons at the quantum level. Here we demonstrate a coherent macroscopic quantum phase, the bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons, which emerges in a CrSBr flake embedded in a fully tunable cryogenic open optical cavity. The Bose condensate is characterized by a highly non-linear threshold-like behavior, and coherence manifests distinctly via its first and second order quantum coherence. We find that the condensate's non-linearity is highly susceptible to the magnetic order in CrSBr, and encounters a sign change depending on the antiferro- and ferromagnetic ordering. Our findings open a route towards magnetically controllable quantum fluids of light, and optomagnonic devices where spin magnetism is coupled to on-chip Bose-Einstein condensates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miklós Antal Werner, Andor Menczer, Örs Legeza</p>
            <p>A brief pedagogical overview of recent advances in tensor network state methods are presented that have the potential to broaden their scope of application radically for strongly correlated molecular systems. These include global fermionic mode optimization, i.e., a general approach to find an optimal matrix product state (MPS) parametrization of a quantum many-body wave function with the minimum number of parameters for a given error margin, the restricted active space DMRG-RAS-X method, multi-orbital correlations and entanglement, developments on hybrid CPU-multiGPU parallelization, and an efficient treatment of non-Abelian symmetries on high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures. Scaling analysis on NVIDIA DGX-A100 platform is also presented.</p>

            <h2>Transverse spin photocurrents in ultrathin topological insulator films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahrzad Movafagh, Predrag Nikolic</p>
            <p>Nonlinear helicity-dependent photocurrents have been reported in 3D topological materials lacking inversion symmetry. Here, we theoretically study the charge and spin photocurrents generated by linear and circularly polarized radiation in ultrathin topological insulator films. Using time-dependent perturbation theory and detailed balance equations, we find that helical transverse spin currents are generated when the symmetry between the top and bottom film surfaces is disturbed. Such spin currents are invariant under in-plane mirror transformations but have $s$-wave and $d$-wave components in regard to transformations under $\pi/2$ rotations. Spin current photo-transistors and amplifiers can be based on these effects.</p>

            <p>Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter - they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems [1-5], that are generically difficult to simulate classically due to their high entanglement. Using an array of superconducting qubits, we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in Ref. [6], image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes, and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>Correlated topological materials often maintain a delicate balance among physical symmetries: many topological orders are symmetry protected, while most correlated phenomena arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is rare to find cases where symmetry breaking induces a non-trivial topological phase. Here, we present the discovery of such a phase in Ta2Pd3Te5, where Coulomb interactions form excitons, which condense below 100 K, opening a topological gap and creating a topological excitonic insulator. Our spectroscopy reveals the full spectral bulk gap stemming from exciton condensation. This excitonic insulator state spontaneously breaks mirror symmetries but involves a very weak structural coupling, as indicated by photoemission spectroscopy, thermodynamic measurements, and a detailed structural analysis. Notably, scanning tunneling microscopy uncovers gapless boundary modes in the bulk insulating phase. Their magnetic field response, together with theoretical modeling, suggests a topological origin. These observations establish Ta2Pd3Te5 as the first confirmed topological excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional crystal. This allows to access the associated physics through bulk-sensitive techniques. Furthermore, we uncover another surprising aspect of the topological excitonic insulator, a secondary excitonic instability near 5 K that breaks the translational symmetry. The wavevector of this state shows an unprecedented magnetic field tunability. Thus, we unveil a unique sequence of topological exciton condensations in a bulk crystal, offering new opportunities to study critical behavior and excitations.</p>

            <p>The back-action damping of mechanical motion by electromagnetic radiation is typically overwhelmed by internal loss channels unless demanding experimental ingredients such as superconducting resonators, high-quality optical cavities, or large magnetic fields are employed. Here we demonstrate the first room temperature, cavity-free, all-electric device where back-action damping exceeds internal loss, enabled by a mechanically compliant parallel-plate capacitor with a nanoscale plate separation and an aspect ratio exceeding 1,000. The device has four orders of magnitude lower insertion loss than a comparable commercial quartz crystal and achieves a position imprecision rivaling optical interferometers. With the help of a back-action isolation scheme, we observe radiative cooling of mechanical motion by a remote cryogenic load.

            <h2>Towards optimization of the Josephson diode effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michiyasu Mori, Wataru Koshibae, Sadamichi Maekawa</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the Josephson diode effect in the junction of singlet superconductors separated by the Rashba system in the in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the bias current. The coupling energy of two superconductors is formulated under the bias current using a tunneling Hamiltonian with a one-dimensional model. The bias current shifts the Fermi momentum in the Rashba system due to the continuity of the electronic current. Including the shift of Fermi momentum in the coupling energy, it is found that the critical current is asymmetric with respect to the current and the magnetic field, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Depending on a distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the Josephson diode effect changes its magnitude and sign. The magnitude is inversely proportional to a band split caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Since $d$ is experimentally controllable, the Josephson diode effect can be optimized by tuning of $d$. Our theory develops a new guiding principle to design the Josephson diode device.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takato Yoshimura, Lucas Sá</p>
            <p>We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

            <p>Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism behind electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that long-range electron-phonon interactions described by a generalized multi-phonon Fröhlich mechanism result in phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broader range of materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mewael Isiet, Mauricio Ponga</p>
            <p>Spall failure, a complex failure mechanism driven by tensile stress wave interactions, has been extensively studied in single-crystal FCC metals, revealing a precursor stage involving dislocation emission along closed-packed directions. Here we investigate the photo-induced spall failure of Ni bicrystals under a two-pulse laser configuration, exploring various misorientation angles through two-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including electronic effects to simulate light-matter interaction. Our findings demonstrate that light-matter interactions can induce spall failure at the sample center, similar to conventional plate-impact methods, when two laser-pulses are applied to the front and back surfaces of the sample. The study reveals the significant influence of misorientation angles on dislocation activity and spall behavior, where grain boundaries (GBs) play pivotal roles, either promoting or impeding dislocation interactions. Furthermore, our work highlights the potential for enhancing spall resistance by tailoring materials through misorientation angle variation.</p>

            <p>Spin-forbidden ($\Delta S \neq 0$) multiplet excitations and their coupling to magnetic properties are of increasing importance for magneto-optical studies of correlated materials. Nonetheless, the mechanisms for optically brightening these transitions and their generality remain poorly understood. Here, we report magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy on the van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet (FM) CrI$_3$. Previously unreported spin-forbidden ($\Delta S = 1$) ${}^4A_{2\mathrm{g}} \to{}^2E_\mathrm{g}/{}^2T_{1\mathrm{g}}$ Cr${}^{3+}$ $dd$ excitations are observed near the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excitation threshold. The assignment of these excitations and their Cr$^{3+}$ multiplet character is established through complementary Cr $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements along with charge transfer multiplet (CTM) calculations and chemical trends in the chromium trihalide series (CrX$_3$, X = Cl, Br, I). We utilize the high sensitivity of MCD spectroscopy to study the thickness dependent optical response. The spin-forbidden excitations remain robust down to the monolayer limit and exhibit a significant magnetic field tunability across the antiferromagnetic to FM transition in few-layer samples. This behavior is associated to changes in the metal-ligand covalency with magnetic state, as supported by our CTM analysis. Our results clarify the magneto-optical response of CrI$_3$ and identify covalency as a central mechanism for the brightening and field-tunability of spin-forbidden multiplet excitations.</p>

            <p>We investigated the pressure effects of a superconductivity on thin films of Sn. Elemental superconductor Sn with a body-centered tetragonal structure, $\beta$-Sn, exhibits superconductivity below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}=3.72$ K) at ambient pressure. $T_{\rm c}$ of Sn increases with lowering dimension such as in thin film and nanowire growth, or by high-pressure application. For thin films, $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits a slight increase up to approximately 4 K compared to the bulk value, attributable to the crystalline size and lattice disorder. By applying pressure on a bulk Sn, $T_{\rm c}$ decreases with increasing pressure from 3.72 K to 5.3 K with the structural transformation into $\gamma$-Sn around 10 GPa. However, the combination of these effects on thin films of Sn, namely, thin-film growth and pressure effects, remains underexplored. In this study, we combined film-growth and pressure-application techniques to further increase $T_{\rm c}$ using a diamond anvil cell with boron-doped diamond electrodes. The drop of the electrical resistance suggesting the onset of $T_{\rm c}$ on the thin film reached above 6 K in $\gamma$-Sn phase. Further, the upper critical magnetic field was drastically enhanced. Atomic force microscopy suggests that the refinement of the grain size of the thin film under the non-hydrostatic pressure conditions contributes to stabilizing the higher $T_{\rm c}$ of $\gamma$-Sn.</p>

            <p>Quantized vortices in type-II superconductors provide insights into the mechanisms of superconductivity. However, the generation of antivortices, characterized by magnetization antiparallel to the external magnetic field, remains less understood. In this study, we investigate Sn-Pb solder, a superconductor with phase-separated Sn and Pb phases, and report the observation of both vortices and antivortices. Scanning SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) microscopy revealed the presence of both vortices and antivortices, while magneto-optical imaging demonstrated flux avalanches. Our results demonstrate that Sn in Sn-Pb solder behaves as a type-II superconductor when magnetic fluxes are trapped, despite bulk Sn being a type-I superconductor with a transition temperature (TcSn) of 3.7 K. Our findings suggest that the size effect and proximity effect with Pb contribute synergistically to induce type-II superconductivity in Sn Notably, vortices were observed at temperatures as high as 5 K, exceeding the bulk TcSn. Furthermore, the interplay between the type-I superconducting Pb phase and the type-II superconducting Sn phase results in the generation of antivortices, providing a mechanism to accommodate excess magnetic flux. This study shed light on new research on composites combining type-I and type-II superconductors.</p>

            <p>Quantum matter phases may co-exist microscopically even when they display competing tendencies. A fundamental question is whether such a competition can be avoided through the elimination of one phase while the other one condenses into the ground state. Here, we present a high-resolution neutron spectroscopy study of the low-energy spin excitations in the high-temperature superconductor La1.855Sr0.145CuO4. In the normal state, we find low-energy magnetic fluctuations at incommensurate reciprocal lattice positions where spin-density-wave order emerges at lower Sr concentration or at high magnetic fields. While these spin excitations are largely suppressed by the emergence of the superconducting spin gap, some low-energy magnetic fluctuations persist deep inside the superconducting state. We interpret this result in terms of a dynamic competition between superconductivity and magnetism, where superconductivity impedes the condensation of low-energy magnetic fluctuations through the formation of magnetically-mediated Cooper pairs.</p>

            <p>Quantum oscillations in magnetization or resistivity are a defining feature of metals subject to an external magnetic field. The phenomenon is generally not expected in insulators without a Fermi surface. The observations of quantum oscillations in Kondo insulating materials have provided a rare counterexample and attracted much theoretical interest. However, the magnetic oscillations in correlated insulators remain poorly understood. Here we report the observations of resistivity quantum oscillations in an excitonic insulator realized in Coulomb-coupled electron-hole double layers with gate-tunability that allows the phenomenon to be explored in a more controllable fashion than in bulk materials. When the cyclotron energy of the electrons or holes is tuned to be comparable to or larger than the exciton binding energy, recurring transitions between excitonic insulators and electron-hole decoupled quantum Hall states are observed. Compressibility measurements show an oscillatory exciton binding energy as a function of magnetic field and electron-hole pair density. Coulomb drag measurements further reveal the formation of excitons with finite angular momentum. Our results are qualitatively captured by mean-field theory calculations. The study demonstrates a new platform for studying quantum oscillations in correlated insulators.</p>

            <p>We study the behavior of Ising spins on Euclidean spacetime backgrounds to determine which properties of the background - curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature - play a role in phase transitions. We construct Ising-like models on Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-Nördstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS) backgrounds. Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature - or Euclidean gravity - increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature.</p>

In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of charged scalar field against a charged black hole background and derives an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordström black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.</p>

            <p>We propose a non-volatile memory element based on a lateral ferromagnetic Josephson junction with spin-orbit coupling and out-of-plane magnetization. The interplay between the latter and the intrinsic exchange field of the ferromagnet leads to a magnetoelectric effect that couples the charge current through the junction and its magnetization, such that by applying a current pulse the direction of the magnetic moment in F can be switched. The two memory states are encoded in the direction of the out-of-plane magnetization. With the aim to determine the optimal working temperature for the memory element, we explore the noise-induced effects on the averaged stationary magnetization by taking into account thermal fluctuations affecting both the Josephson phase and the magnetic moment dynamics. We investigate the switching process as a function of intrinsic parameters of the ferromagnet, such as the Gilbert damping and strength of the spin-orbit coupling, and proposed a non-destructive readout scheme based on a dc-SQUID. Additionally, we analyze a way to protect the memory state from external perturbations by voltage gating in systems with a both linear-in-momentum Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Brian Winkler, Marijan Beg, Martin Lang, Mathias Kläui, Hans Fangohr</p>
            <p>Magnetic Bloch points (BPs) are highly confined magnetization configurations, that often occur in transient spin dynamics processes. However, opposing chiralities of adjacent layers for instance in a FeGe bilayer stack can stabilize such magnetic BPs at the layer interface. These BPs configurations are metastable and consist of two coupled vortices (one in each layer) with same circularity and opposite polarity. Each vortex is stabilized by opposite sign Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This stabilization mechanism potentially opens the door towards BP-based spintronic applications. An open question, from a methodological point of view, is whether the Heisenberg (HB) model approach (atomistic model) as to be used to study such systems or if the -- computationally more efficient -- micromagnetic (MM) models can be used and still obtain robust results. We are modelling and comparing the energetics and dynamics of a stable BP obtained using both HB and MM approaches. We find that an MM description of a stable BP leads qualitatively to the same results as the HB description, and that an appropriate mesh discretization plays a more important role than the chosen model. Further, we study the dynamics by shifting the BP with an applied in-plane field and investigating the relaxation after switching the filed off abruptly. The precessional motion of coupled vortices in a BP state can be drastically reduced compared to a classical vortex, which may be also an interesting feature for fast and efficient devices. A recent study has shown that a bilayer stack hosting BPs can be used to retain information [1].</p>

            <h2>Omnidirectional domain wall modes protected by fragile topological states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pegah Azizi, Siddhartha Sarkar, Kai Sun, Stefano Gonella</p>
            <p>So-called fragile topological states of matter challenge our conventional notion of topology by lacking the robustness typically associated with topological protection, thereby displaying elusive manifestations that are difficult to harness for wave control. In this Letter, we leverage the recent discovery of fragile topological states in special classes of structural kagome lattices to document the availability of domain wall elastic wave modes that are directly traceable to fragile topology and, yet, exhibit remarkably strong signatures that support omni-directionality. We design twisted kagome bi-domains comprising two topologically distinct sublattices - one trivial and the other fragile topological - sharing a common bandgap and meeting at a domain wall. The two phases are achieved via carefully engineered surface cut patterns that modify the band landscape of the underlying lattices in complementary fashions, leading to dichotomous irreps landscapes. Under these circumstances, a domain wall-bound mode emerges within the shared bandgap and displays remarkable stability against domain wall orientation and introduced defects. We corroborate these findings via $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian and Jackiw-Rabbi analysis and validate them experimentally through laser vibrometry tests on a prototype endowed with water jet-induced perforation patterns.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocity of supercurrent along applied magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Gaggioli, Yasen Hou, Jagadeesh S. Moodera, Akashdeep Kamra</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocal current responses arise in a broad range of systems, from magnons and phonons to supercurrents, due to an interplay between spatial and temporal symmetry breakings. These find applications in devices, such as circulators and rectifiers, as well as in probing the interactions and states that underlie the nonreciprocity. An established symmetry argument anticipates emergence of nonreciprocal currents along a direction perpendicular to the applied magnetic field that breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Here, motivated by recent experiments, we examine the emergence of nonreciprocity in vortex-limited superconducting critical currents along an applied magnetic field. Employing London's equations for describing the Meissner response of a superconducting film, we find that an additional symmetry breaking due to a preferred vortex axis enables nonreciprocal critical currents along the applied magnetic field, consistent with the so far unexplained experimental observation. Building on our concrete theoretical model for supercurrents, we discuss a possible generalization of the prevailing symmetry consideration to encompass nonreciprocal currents along the time-reversal symmetry breaking direction.</p>

The lattices are passive materials so no driving torques are needed to obtain transverse flow. A method for determination of the length scale associated with chirality is provided.

            <h2>Quantum transport theory for unconventional magnets; interplay of altermagnetism and p-wave magnetism with superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Kokkeler, Ilya Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret</p>
            <p>We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Singularity of Levy walks in the lifted Pomeau-Manneville map</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Brevitt, Alexander Schulz, Dominic Pegler, Holger Kantz, Rainer Klages</p>
            <p>Since groundbreaking works in the 1980s it is well-known that simple deterministic dynamical systems can display intermittent dynamics and weak chaos leading to anomalous diffusion. A paradigmatic example is the Pomeau-Manneville (PM) map which, suitably lifted onto the whole real line, was shown to generate superdiffusion that can be reproduced by stochastic Levy walks (LWs). Here we report that this matching only holds for parameter values of the PM map that are of Lebesgue measure zero in its two-dimensional parameter space. This is due to a bifurcation scenario that the map exhibits under variation of one parameter. Constraining this parameter to specific singular values at which the map generates superdiffusion by varying the second one, as has been done in previous literature, we find quantitative deviations between deterministic diffusion and diffusion generated by stochastic LWs in a particular range of parameter values, which cannot be cured by simple LW modifcations. We also explore the effect of aging on superdiffusion in the PM map and show that this yields a profound change of the diffusive properties under variation of the aging time, which should be important for experiments. Our findings demonstrate that even in this simplest well-studied setting, a matching of deterministic and stochastic diffusive properties is non-trivial.</p>

            <h2>Space-Time-Coupled Qubits for Enhanced Superconducting Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajjad Taravati</p>
            <p>The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth ions doped in crystals with low nuclear-spin densities are highly promising candidates for quantum technology applications. In this study, we investigated the spectroscopic properties of the 7F0 - 5 D0 optical and the hyperfine transitions of Eu3+ ions in a CaWO4 crystal, where the nuclear spin arises solely from the 183W isotope, with a natural abundance of 14%. At a temperature of 3 K, we experimentally identified four distinct crystal field environments for Eu3+ ions in a 0.1 at.% Eu3+ doped CaWO4 crystal. The optical coherence properties of Eu3+ ions in these environments were characterized. Additionally, we resolved the hyperfine structures in the 7F0 ground state and 5D0 excited state, and determined the 7F0 ground state lifetimes using spectral hole-burning techniques. These findings highlight the significant potential of Eu3+:CaWO4 for optical quantum memory applications.</p>

            <h2>Electrically tunable Floquet Weyl photon emission from Dirac semimetal Cd3As2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sobhan Subhra Mishra, Thomas CaiWei Tan, Manoj Gupta, Faxian Xiu, Ranjan Singh</p>
            <p>The ability to optically engineer the Dirac band and electrically control the Fermi level in two-dimensional (2D) Dirac systems, such as graphene, has significantly advanced quantum technologies. However, similar tunability has remained elusive in three-dimensional Dirac systems. In this work, we demonstrate both optical and electrical tunability of the band structure in the 3D Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Photoexcitation with circularly polarized light breaks time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracy at Dirac points to transform the material into a Floquet Weyl semimetal with chiral Weyl nodes. This transition induces nonzero Berry curvature, giving rise to helicity-dependent transverse anomalous photocurrents, detectable through terahertz emission at normal incidence. Furthermore, applying an external electric field displaces the Fermi level away from the Dirac point, enlarging the Dirac cone projection leading to a reduced density of states of Fermi arcs. As a result, we achieve precise electrical control over Floquet band engineering, resulting in a large modulation of THz emission. Moreover, at oblique incidence, the circular photon-drag effect induces helicity-dependent longitudinal photocurrents. Simultaneous generation and manipulation of both longitudinal and transverse photocurrents enable precise control of the helicity of emitted THz pulses. These results pave the way for electric field-controlled Floquet Weyl THz sources, offering significant potential for applications in quantum computing and low-power electronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Logan Blackham, Arshath Manjalingal, Saeed R. Koshkaki, Arkajit Mandal</p>
            <p>We develop an analytical microscopic theory to describe the polaron-polariton dispersion, formed by hybridizing excitons, photons, and phonons, and their coherent dynamics inside optical cavities. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we derive a simple analytical model by pursuing a non-perturbative treatment of the phonon and photon couplings to excitons. Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry. Our theory also sheds light on the long-lived coherent ballistic motion of exciton-polaritons with high excitonic character that propagate with group velocities lower than is expected from pure exciton-polariton bands, offering a microscopic explanation for these puzzling experimental observations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Origin of Strain-Tunable Giant Second-Harmonic Generation in Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X=S, Se, Te)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhefeng Lou, Zhihao Gong, Ziye Zhu, Wenbin Li, Xiao Lin, Hua Wang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials with giant nonlinear optical (NLO) responses are essential for the development of advanced on-chip NLO devices. Using first-principles calculations, we predict a remarkable strain-induced enhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in the high-performance 2D semiconductors Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X = S, Se, Te). The SHG susceptibilities of Bi$_2$O$_2$X under strain are on the order of 1~nm/V, rivalling the highest values reported among 2D materials. This giant SHG response originates from gauge-invariant geometric quantities, including the quantum metric, shift vector, and triple phase product. The strain also induces a bandgap variation in Bi$_2$O$_2$X. Intriguingly, in Bi$_2$O$_2$Te, strain-induced bandgap tuning drives a transition from a semiconductor to a half-metal, and ultimately to a polar metal. Our findings present a unique platform that combines strain-tunable bandgap engineering with exceptional NLO properties, while also highlighting the crucial role of quantum geometry in enhancing SHG.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. M. Gordeeva, G. A. Bobkov, A. M. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova, Tao Yu</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet trilayer sandwiched between two superconductors (S/F/I/F/S heterostructure). It is well-known that a conceptually similar S/F/S system is a platform for implementing ultra-strong magnon-photon coupling. Here, we demonstrate that in such S/F/I/F/S heterostructure, ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling also appears. The strength of this interaction is many times greater than the strength of the usual dipole-dipole interaction. It is mediated via Meissner currents excited in the superconductor layers by the magnon stray fields. The strength of the magnon-magnon coupling is anisotropic, and its anisotropy is opposite to the anisotropy of the magnon-photon coupling, which allows them to be separated. Both couplings become much stronger when the temperature drops below the critical temperature of the superconductor layers. It enables the implementation of an efficient tuning of the wavenumber in the S/F/I/F/S heterostructures controlled by temperature in a wide range of frequencies. Overall, the rich and tunable spectrum of S/F/I/F/S multilayers opens broad prospects for their application in magnonics.</p>

            <h2>The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Chen, Bishnu Karki, Pavan Hosur</p>
            <p>The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.</p>

By employing parton mean-field theory, we discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties.</p>

            <h2>Strong-coupling RPA theory of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition: universal thermodynamics and two-body contact</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Dupuis, Moksh Bhateja, Adam Rançon</p>
            <p>We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation (RPA) describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator--superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid phase near the phase transition. The critical quasi-particles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass $m^*$ and their mutual interaction is described by an effective $s$-wave scattering length $a^*$. The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass $m$ and the scattering length in vacuum $a$ by $m^*$ and $a^*$, and the density $n$ by the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a ``universal'' two-body contact $C_{\rm univ}$ that controls the high-momentum tail $\sim 1/|{\bf k}|^4$ of the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}^{\rm sd}$ which controls the high-momentum tail of $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a ``full'' contact $C$ which controls the high-momentum tail of the full momentum distribution $n_{\bf k}$.</p>

            <h2>Study on the SDW and Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at ambient pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Bo Liu, Hongyi Sun, Ming Zhang, Qihang Liu, Wei-Qiang Chen, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) with $T_c\approx 80$ K in the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has aroused great interests. Currently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP). Particularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density wave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave vector near $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we employ first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation (RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and potential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our density-functional-theory (DFT) band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer tight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which is equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA calculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave vector $Q\approx(0,0.84\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From view in the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to $Q_0\approx(0.42\pi,0.42\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various experiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic order with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with recent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin of the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the itinerant picture as driven by FS-nesting. In the aspect of SC, our RPA study yields an approximate $s^\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$ considerably lower than that under high pressure, which is consistent with experiments. Furthermore, the $T_c$ can be strongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC in the material.</p>

            <h2>A Micromechanical Model for Light-interactive Molecular Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devesh Tiwari, Ananya Renuka Balakrishna</p>
            <p>Molecular crystals respond to a light stimulus by bending, twisting, rolling, jumping, or other kinematic behaviors. These behaviors are known to be affected by, among others, the intensity of the incident light, the aspect ratios of crystal geometries, and the volume changes accompanying phase transformation. While these factors, individually, explain the increase in internal energy of the system and its subsequent minimization through macroscopic deformation, they do not fully explain the diversity of deformations observed in molecular crystals. Here, we propose a micromechanical model based on the Cauchy-Born rule and photoreaction theory to predict the macroscopic response in molecular crystals. By accounting for lattice geometry changes and microstructural patterns that emerge during phase transformation, we predict a range of deformations in a representative molecular crystal (salicylideneamine). Doing so, we find that the interplay between photoexcited states and the energy minimization pathways, across a multi-well energy landscape, is crucial to the bending and twisting deformations. We use our model to analyze the role of particle geometries and the intensity of incident light on macroscopic deformation, and identify geometric regimes for shearing and twisting deformations in salicylideneamine crystals. Our micromechanical model is general and can be adapted to predict photomechanical deformation in other molecular crystals undergoing a solid-to-solid phase change and has potential as a computational design tool to engineer reversible and controllable actuation in molecular crystals.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen production via the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) is critical for sustainable energy solutions, yet the reliance on expensive platinum (Pt) catalysts limits scalability. Zirconium-doped (\ce{Zr}-doped) MXenes, such as \ce{Ti3C2} and \ce{Ti3CN}, emerge as transformative alternatives, combining abundance, tunable electronic properties, and high catalytic potential. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we show that \ce{Zr} doping at 3\% and 7\% significantly enhances HER activity by reducing the work function to the optimal range of 3.5-4.5~eV and achieving near-zero Gibbs free energy (\dgh) values of 0.18-0.16~eV, conditions ideal for efficient hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Bader charge analysis reveals substantial charge redistribution with enhanced electron accumulation at \ce{Zr} and \ce{N} sites, further driving catalytic performance. This synergy between optimized electronic structure and catalytic properties establishes \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as cost-effective, high-performance alternatives to noble metals for HER. By combining exceptional catalytic efficiency with scalability, our work positions \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as a breakthrough for green hydrogen production, offering a robust pathway toward renewable energy technologies and advancing the design of next-generation non-precious metal catalysts.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of a pronounced third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) in 1$T$-phase VSe$_2$ nanosheets, synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The nanosheets exhibit a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $\sim$77 K. Detailed angle-resolved and temperature-dependent measurements reveal a strong cubic relationship between the third-harmonic Hall voltage $V_{3\omega}^\perp$ and the bias current $I_\omega$, persisting up to room temperature. Notably, the third-order NLHE demonstrates a twofold angular dependence and significant enhancement below the CDW transition temperature, indicative of threefold symmetry breaking in the CDW phase. Scaling analysis suggests that the intrinsic contribution from the Berry connection polarizability tensor is substantially increased in the CDW phase, while extrinsic effects dominate at higher temperatures. Our findings highlight the critical role of CDW-induced symmetry breaking in modulating quantum geometric properties and nonlinear transport phenomena in VSe$_2$, paving the way for future explorations in low-dimensional quantum materials.</p>

Using the slave boson mean field approximation, we find that the spin nematic order remains stable against small Kondo coupling, and the localized spins and the conduction electrons are effectively decoupled. On the other hand, a standard Fermi liquid state is formed for sufficiently strong Kondo interactions. Furthermore, in an intermediate region with moderate Kondo coupling, the spin nematic order and the Kondo effect coexist, and superconducting pairing of the conduction electrons is induced by the spinon pairing. We discuss the ground state phase diagram and nature of the quantum phase transitions between the different superconducting states.</p>

            <p>The search for quantum spin liquids (QSL) and chemical doping in such materials to explore superconductivity have continuously attracted intense interest. Here, we report the discovery of a potential QSL candidate, pyrochlore-lattice beta-NaYbO2. Colorless and transparent NaYbO2 single crystals, layered alpha-NaYbO2 (~250 um on edge) and octahedral beta-NaYbO2 (~50 um on edge), were grown for the first time. Synchrotron X-ray single crystal diffraction unambiguously determined that the newfound beta-NaYbO2 belongs to the three-dimensional pyrochlore structure characterized by the R-3m space group, corroborated by synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and pair distribution function. Magnetic measurements revealed no long-range magnetic order or spin glass behavior down to 0.4 K with a low boundary spin frustration factor of 17.5, suggesting a potential QSL ground state. Under high magnetic fields, the potential QSL state was broken and spins order. Our findings reveal that NaYbO2 is a fertile playground for studying novel quantum states.</p>

            <p>It is well known that the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) arises from the integration of the non-zero Berry curvature (BC), conventionally observed in the Dirac/Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. Moreover, nodal surface semimetals are expected to exhibit more significant BC under the prevalence of degenerate points near the Fermi level. In this work, we report the detection of a giant AHE in the Kagome magnet Fe$_3$Ge with a two-dimensional (2D) nodal surface (NS) at $k_{z}=\pi$ plane, exhibiting an anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 1500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at 160 K, the highest among all reported Kagome topological materials. This finding suggests a new platform for searching large AHC materials and facilitates potential room-temperature applications in spintronic devices and quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yutan Zhang, Philip M. Dee, Benjamin Cohen-Stead, Thomas A. Maier, Steven Johnston, Richard Scalettar</p>
            <p>A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials exhibiting some but not all of the characteristics necessary for a robust superconducting state could, in principle, be coupled with other materials in a way that alleviates their intrinsic shortcomings. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].</p>

            <p>We report the observation of Josephson diode effect (JDE) in hybrid devices made from semiconductor InAs nanosheets and superconductor Al contacts. By applying an in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\mathrm{xy}}$), we detect non-reciprocal superconducting switching current as well as non-reciprocal superconducting retrapping current. The strength of the JDE depends on the angle between the in-plane magnetic field and the bias current ($I_{\mathrm{b}}$), reaching its maximum when $B_{\mathrm{xy}} \perp I_{\mathrm{b}}$ and dropping to nearly zero when $B_{\mathrm{xy}}\parallel I_{\mathrm{b}}$. Additionally, the diode efficiency is tunable via an electrostatic gate with a complete suppression at certain gate voltages. Our findings indicate that the observed JDE in InAs nanosheet-based Josephson junctions most likely arises from the Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the nanosheets. Such gate-tunable JDE in Josephson junctions made from semiconductor material with SOI is useful not only for constructing advanced superconducting electronics but also for detecting novel superconducting states.</p>

            <h2>First-principle based Floquet engineering of solids in the velocity gauge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal Tiwari, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>We introduce a practical and accurate strategy to capture light-matter interactions using the Floquet formalism in the velocity gauge in combination with realistic first-principle models of solids. The velocity gauge, defined by the linear coupling to the vector potential, is a standard method to capture the light-matter interaction in solids. However, its use with first-principle models has been limited by the challenging fact that it requires a large number of bands for convergence and its incompatibility with non-local pseudopotential plane wave methods. To improve its convergence properties, we explicitly take into account the truncation of Hilbert space in the construction of the Floquet Hamiltonian in the velocity gauge. To avoid the incompatibility with the pseudopotentials, we base our computations on generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from first-principles through maximally-localized Wannier functions. We exemplify the approach by computing the optical absorption spectra of laser-dressed trans-polyacetylene chain using realistic electronic structure. We show that, by proceeding in this way, Floquet consideration involving the truncated Hilbert spaces reproduces the full basis calculations with only a few bands and with significantly reduced computation time. The strategy has been implemented in FloqticS, a general code for the Floquet engineering of the optical properties of materials. Overall, this work introduces a useful theoretical tool to realize Floquet engineering of realistic solids in the velocity gauge.</p>

            <p>The optical selection rules endorsed by symmetry are crucial for understanding the optical properties of quantum materials and the associated ultrafast spectral phenomena. Herein, we introduce momentum-resolved Floquet optical selection rules using the group theory to elucidate the pump-probe photoemission spectral distributions of monolayer black phosphorus (BP), which are governed by the symmetries of both the material and the lasers. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we further investigate the dynamical evolution of Floquet(-Volkov) states in the photoemission spectra of monolayer BP, revealing their spectral weights at specific momenta for each sideband. These observations are comprehensively explained by the proposed Floquet optical selection rules. Our framework not only clarifies experimental photoemission spectra but also uncovers novel characteristics under different pump-probe configurations. Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of light-induced ultrafast spectra in BP and can be further extended to other Floquet systems.</p>

            <p>We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</p>

            <h2>The geometric impact of the quantum Hall interface on a cone</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Li, Qi Li, Zi-Xiang Hu</p>
            <p>Recently, quantum Hall interface has become a popular subject of research; distinct from that of the quantum Hall edge, which is constrained by external background confinement, the interface has the freedom to move, likely towards a string-like state. In disk geometry, it was known that the interface energy has an extra correction due to its curvature which depends on the size of the disk. In this work, we analytically calculate the energy of the integer quantum Hall interface on a cone surface which has the advantage that its curvature is more easily adjustable. By tuning the length and curvature of the interface by the cone angle parameter $\beta$, we analyze the dependence of the quantum Hall interface energy on the curvature and verify this geometric correction. Moreover, we find that the tip of the cone geometry has an extra contribution to the energy that reflects on the $u_2,u_4$ term.</p>

However, existing works for advanced technology transistors use simplified empirical models to calculate effective thermal conductivity in the simulations. In this work, we present a dataset of size-dependent effective thermal conductivity with electron and phonon properties extracted from ab initio computations. Absolute in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity data of eight semiconducting materials (Si, Ge, GaN, AlN, 4H-SiC, GaAs, InAs, BAs) and four metallic materials (Al, W, TiN, Ti) with the characteristic length ranging from 5 to 50 nanometers have been provided. Besides the absolute value, normalized effective thermal conductivity is also given, in case it needs to be used with updated bulk thermal conductivity in the future.

            <p>Magnons possess the ability to transport spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials, a characteristic that sets them apart from traditional electronics where power consumption arises from the movement of electrons. However, the practical application of magnon devices demands room temperature operation and low switching power of perpendicular magnetization. Here we demonstrate the low-power manipulation of perpendicular magnetization via magnon torques in SnTe/NiO/CoFeB devices at room temperature. Topological crystalline insulator SnTe exhibits a high spin Hall conductivity of $\sigma_s \approx 6.1\times 10^4 (\hbar/2e)\cdot (\Omega \cdot m)^{-1}$, which facilitates the generation of magnon currents in an antiferromagnetic insulator NiO. The magnon currents traverse the 20-nm-thick NiO layer and subsequently exert magnon torques on the adjacent ferromagnetic layer, leading to magnetization switching. Notably, we achieve a 22-fold reduction in power consumption in SnTe/NiO/CoFeB heterostructures compared to Bi2Te3/NiO/CoFeB control samples. Our findings establish the low-power perpendicular magnetization manipulation through magnon torques, significantly expanding the range of topological materials with practical applications.</p>

            <p>YBa2Cu3Ox, the first superconductor discovered with Tc higher than 77 K, is among the most complex cuprates having both CuO chains and plains in the structure. YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) exhibits slightly overdoped behavior and further doping is difficult as all the lattice sites in the CuO chains are occupied. We have grown high quality single crystalline films of YBCO and bilayer La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)/YBCO exhibiting superconductivity in both the cases. Photoemission spectra reveal different surface and bulk electronic structures; the difference reduces in the bilayer. Evidence of charge transfer across the bilayer interface is observed in the valence band and core level spectra indicating an overdoped condition in YBCO. While superconductivity in the presence of magnetic order in the bilayer is puzzling, this pathway to reach overdoped regime in YBCO opens up a new landscape to probe the exotic physics of unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized La3Ni2O7 with a transition temperature of approximately 80 K above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has sparked significant attention. It is essential to search for high-temperature superconductivity in bulk samples and at ambient pressure in nickelates. In this study, we report influential factors that affect the appearance of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at ambient pressure. From direct-current magnetic measurements, we observe a clear diamagnetic response at 80 K in post-annealed single crystals of La3Ni2O7 in oxygen. The superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be within 0.2%, resulting in a decrease in resistivity. This work presents a practical approach for further investigating high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p>

This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.</p>

Our study examines four Pt-YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples with varying $\delta$ (0.12 $\leq \delta \leq$ 0.56) using voltage-current measurements across a temperature range. We successfully model the electrical behavior using a Poole-Frenkel conduction framework, revealing that oxygen vacancies create potential wells that trap carriers, directly influencing conduction. We observe that the energy of these traps increases as $\delta$ rises, in agreement with a peak previously detected in optical conductivity measurements. This result supports earlier interpretations, strengthening the proposed connection between oxygen vacancies and the ionization energy associated with impurity bands in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$.</p>

We consider iron in aluminum nitride, a material of interest for hybrid quantum technologies, and we carry out calculations with quantum embedding methods -- density matrix embedding theory (DMET) and quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) and with spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We show that both DMET and QDET accurately describe the ground state and low-lying excited states of the defect, and that TDDFT yields photoluminescence spectra in agreement with experiments. In addition, we provide a detailed discussion of the convergence of our results as a function of the active space used in the embedding methods, thus defining a protocol to obtain converged data, directly comparable with experiments.</p>

            <p>We present a dynamic theory for the droplet size distribution in chemically active emulsions, considering a simple ternary mixture with a conserved density. We show that the collective behavior of many droplets, such as monodispersity, emerges through a coupling of the conserved density in the far field.

A key finding is a universal scaling behavior, leading to the collapse of the rescaled size distributions at late times. Our results suggest that the key features of our dynamic theory are generic and apply to the broader class of multi-component systems with conservation laws and active chemical reactions.</p>

In this review of shape-morphing metamaterials, we examine the current state of the field and propose a unified classification system for the mechanisms involved, as well as the design principles underlying them. Specifically, we explore two main categories of unit cells-those that exploit structural anisotropy or internal rotations-and two potential approaches to tessellating these cells: based on kinematic compatibility or geometric frustration. We conclude by discussing the available design tools and highlighting emerging challenges in the development of shape-morphing metamaterials.</p>

            <p>Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are indispensable in fields such as quantum science and technology, astronomy, and biomedical imaging, where high detection efficiency, low dark count rates and high timing accuracy are required. Recently, helium (He) ion irradiation was shown to be a promising method to enhance SNSPD performance. Here, we study how changes in the underlying superconducting NbTiN film and the SiO2/Si substrate affect device performance. While irradiated and unirradiated NbTiN films show similar crystallinity, we observe He bubble formation below the SiO2/Si interface and an amorphization of the Si substrate. Both reduce the thermal conductance between the superconducting thin film and the substrate from 210 W/m^2/K^4 to 70 W/m^2/K^4 after irradiation with 2000 ions/nm^2. This effect, combined with the lateral straggle of He ions in the substrate, allows the modification of the superconductor-to-substrate thermal conductance of an SNSPD by selectively irradiating the regions around the nanowire. With this approach, we achieved an increased plateau width of saturating intrinsic detection efficiency of 9.8 uA compared to 3.7 uA after full irradiation. Moreover, the critical current remained similar to that of the unirradiated reference device (59 uA versus 60.1 uA), while full irradiation reduced it to 22.4 uA. Our results suggest that the irradiation-induced reduction of the thermal conductance significantly enhances SNSPD sensitivity, offering a novel approach to locally engineer substrate properties for improved detector performance.</p>

            <p>Micromagnetic modeling is employed to optimize the design of artificial synapse devices based on the spin-orbit-torque (SOT) driven domain wall (DW) motion along a nanotrack with triangular notches. Key attributes, such as the thermal stability of the pinned DW and depinning currents, are obtained for varied nanotrack geometry and pinning strength. Depinning probability as a function of SOT current density and pulse width is studied using finite temperature micromagnetic simulations for varying pinning potential. Results show that wider notches provide better thermal stability - depinning current trade-off. On the other hand, narrow notches exhibit less variation in the depinning times at finite temperatures. It is observed that the DW position can be set precisely to any desired location by the SOT current pulse if the thermal stability is sufficiently high. It is also observed that the meta-plastic functionality can be obtained by adding notches of progressively higher depinning currents along the rectangular nanotrack.</p>

            <p>As the conventional scaling of logic devices comes to an end, functional wafer backside and 3D transistor stacking are consensus for next-generation logic technology, offering considerable design space extension for powers, signals or even devices on the wafer backside. The Flip FET (FFET), a novel transistor architecture combining 3D transistor stacking and fully functional wafer backside, was recently proposed. With symmetric dual-sided standard cell design, the FFET can deliver around 12.5% cell area scaling and faster but more energy-efficient libraries beyond other stacked transistor technologies such as CFET. Besides, thanks to the novel cell design with dual-sided pins, the FFET supports dual-sided signal routing, delivering better routability and larger backside design space. In this work, we demonstrated a comprehensive FFET evaluation framework considering physical implementation and block-level power-performance-area (PPA) assessment for the first time, in which key functions are dual-sided routing and dual-sided RC extraction. A 32-bit RISC-V core was used for the evaluation here. Compared to the CFET with single-sided signals, the FFET with single-sided signals achieved 23.3% post-P&R core area reduction, 25.0% higher frequency and 11.9% lower power at the same utilization, and 16.0 % higher frequency at the same core area. Meanwhile, the FFET supports dual-sided signals, which can further benefit more from flexible allocation of cell input pins on both sides. By optimizing the input pin density and BEOL routing layer number on each side, 10.6% frequency gain was realized without power degradation compared to the one with single-sided signal routing. Moreover, the routability and power efficiency of FFET barely degrades even with the routing layer number reduced from 12 to 5 on each side, validating the great space for cost-friendly design enabled by FFET.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vit Jakubsky</p>
            <p>Quasi-one-dimensional chains of atoms can be effectively described by one-dimensional Dirac-type equation. Crystal structure of the chain is reflected by pseudo-spin of the quasi-particles. In the article, we present a simple framework where supersymmetric transformation is utilized to generate an interaction between two, initially non-interacting systems described by pseudo-spin-one Dirac-type equation. In the presented example, the transformation converts two asymptotically non-interacting atomic chains into a saw chain locally. The model possesses a flat band whose energy can be fine-tuned deliberately.</p>

            <h2>Transient Finite Element Simulation of Accelerator Magnets Using Thermal Thin Shell Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik Schnaubelt, Andrea Vitrano, Mariusz Wozniak, Emmanuele Ravaioli, Arjan Verweij, Sebastian Schöps</p>
            <p>Thermal transient responses of superconducting magnets can be simulated using the finite element (FE) method. Some accelerator magnets use cables whose electric insulation is significantly thinner than the bare electric conductor. The FE discretisation of such geometries with high-quality meshes leads to many degrees of freedom. This increases the computational time, particularly since non-linear material properties are involved. In this work, we propose to use a thermal thin-shell approximation (TSA) to improve the computational efficiency when solving the heat diffusion equation in two dimensions. We apply the method to compute the thermal transient response of superconducting accelerator magnets used for CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC. The TSA collapses thin electrical insulation layers into lines while accurately representing the thermal gradient across the insulation's thickness. The TSA is implemented in the multipole module of the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS), which can generate the multipole magnet models programmatically from input text files. First, the TSA approach is verified by comparison to classical FE simulations with meshed surface insulation regions for a simple block of four cables and a detailed model of the MBH dipole. The results show that the TSA approach reduces the computational time significantly while preserving the accuracy of the solution. Second, the quench heater (QH) delay computed with the TSA method is compared to measurements for the MBH magnet. To this end, the thermal transient simulation is coupled to a magnetostatic solution to account for magneto-resistive effects. Third, the TSA's full capabilities are showcased in non-linear magneto-thermal simulations of several LHC and HL-LHC superconducting magnet models. The full source code, including all input files, is publicly available.</p>

            <p>Copper is one of the most extensively studied materials for energy conversion and catalytic systems, with a wide range of other applications from nanophotonics to biotechnology. However, existing synthesis methods are limited with many undesirable by-products and poorly defined morphologies. Here, we report a surfactant-free on-substrate wet synthesis approach that yields monocrystalline metallic Cu microflakes with (111) crystalline exposed surface. By systematically studying the growth mechanism, we achieve unprecedented sizes of more than 130 {\mu}m, which is two orders of magnitude larger than reported in most previous studies, along with higher aspect ratios of over 400. Furthermore, we show distinctly higher stability against oxidation provided by the halide adlayer. Overall, our facile synthesis approach delivers an exciting venue for the emerging fields of catalysis and nanophotonics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noé Blassel, Tony Lelièvre, Gabriel Stoltz</p>
            <p>We derive novel sharp low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide sharp estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring--Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Afsaneh L. Sanati, Timur Nikitin, Rui Fausto, Carmel Majidi, Mahmoud Tavakoli</p>
            <p>Energy storage devices with liquid_metal electrodes have attracted interest in recent years due to their potential for mechanical resilience, self_healing, dendrite_free operation, and fast reaction kinetics. Gallium alloys like Eutectic Gallium Indium (EGaIn) are appealing due to their low melting point and high theoretical specific capacity. However, EGaIn electrodes are unstable in highly alkaline electrolytes due to Gallium oxide dissolution. In this letter, this bottleneck is addressed by introducing chemically stable films in which nanoscale droplets of EGaIn are coated with trace amounts of graphene oxide (GO). It is demonstrated that a GO to EGaIn weight ratio as low as 0.01 provides enough protection for a thin film formed by GO EGaIn nanocomposite against significantly acidic or alkaline environments (pH 1-14). It is shown that GO coating significantly enhances the surface stability in such environments, thus improving the energy storage capacity by over 10x. Microstructural analysis confirms GO EGaIn composite stability and enhanced electrochemical performance. Utilizing this, a thin film supercapacitor is fabricated. Results indicate that when coating the EGaIn with GO to EGaIn ratio of 0.001 the areal capacitance improves by 10 times, reaching 20.02 mF cm_2. This breakthrough paves the way for advanced liquid metal-based thin film electrodes, promising significant improvements in energy storage applications.</p>

            <p>We argue that a uniform acceleration of matter produces an effect similar to cooling, thus leading, in particular, to the enhancement effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking. This conclusion is supported by the observation by Unruh and Weiss that thermal correlation functions computed at a temperature equal to the Unruh temperature are identical to the corresponding correlation functions in a Minkowski (zero-temperature) vacuum. We consider an example of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a co-accelerating reference frame and show that the uniform acceleration of hot gas of interacting fermions enhances the mass gap generation and increases the critical temperature of the chiral transition. We derive a simple dependence of the critical temperature of a second-order phase transition on acceleration that, as we argue, should be applicable to a broad range of field theories.</p>

            <p>Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model refines itself from its own predictions, has garnered attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD in binary classification tasks with noisy labeled Gaussian mixture data, utilizing a replica theory. Our findings reveals that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate the efficacy of practical heuristics, such as early stopping for extracting meaningful signal and bias fixation for imbalanced data. These results provide both theoretical guarantees and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. Trachenko</p>
            <p>We review fundamental problems involved in liquid theory including both classical and quantum liquids. Understanding classical liquids involves exploring details of their microscopic dynamics and its consequences. Here, we apply the same general idea to quantum liquids. We discuss momentum condensation in liquid helium which is consistent with microscopic dynamics in liquids and high mobility of liquid atoms. We propose that mobile transit atoms accumulate in the finite-energy state where the transit speed is close to the speed of sound. In this state, the transit energy is close to the zero-point energy. In momentum space, the accumulation operates on a sphere with the radius set by interatomic spacing and corresponds to zero net momentum. We show that this picture is supported by experiments, including the kinetic energy of helium atoms below the superfluid transition and sharp peaks of scattered intensity at predicted energy. We discuss the implications of this picture including the macroscopic wave function and superfluidity. The superfluid transition temperature is evaluated to be within 15% of the experimental value.</p>

            <p>Using a systematic ab initio quantum many-body approach that goes beyond low-energy models, we directly compute the superconducting pairing order and estimate the pairing gap of several doped cuprate materials and structures within a purely electronic picture. We find that we can correctly capture two well-known trends: the pressure effect, where the pairing order and gap increase with intra-layer pressure, and the layer effect, where the pairing order and gap vary with the number of copper-oxygen layers. From these calculations, we observe that the strength of superexchange and the covalency at optimal doping are the best descriptors for these trends. Our microscopic analysis further identifies that strong short-range spin fluctuations and multi-orbital charge fluctuations drive the development of the pairing order. Our work illustrates the possibility of a material-specific ab initio understanding of unconventional high-temperature superconducting materials.</p>

            <p>The boundary critical behavior of the two-dimensional (2D) quantum antiferromagnetic (AF) XXZ model coupled with either a dangling spin-1/2 XXZ chain or a dangling two-leg ladder on the boundary is studied with the bosonization and renormalization group analysis. A rich boundary phase diagram is obtained in each case. In the dangling chain case, the boundary either develops a long-range AF order in the easy-plane or the easy-axis direction with extraordinary critical behavior, or has a valence bond solid order with ordinary boundary critical behavior. In the case of a dangling two-leg ladder, besides the possible easy-plane or easy-axis AF ordered phases on the boundary with extraordinary critical behavior, the boundary can form a singlet phase with ordinary critical behavior without breaking any symmetry. These results are consistent with recent numerical simulations on the boundary critical behavior of 2D quantum spin models.</p>

            <p>We prove a linear stability-dissipation relation (SDR) for $q$-state Potts models driven far from equilibrium by a nonconservative force. At a critical coupling strength, these models exhibit a synchronisation transition from a decoherent into a synchronised state. In the vicinity of this transition, the SDR connects the entropy production rate per oscillator to the phase-space contraction rate, a measure of stability, in a simple way. For large but finite systems, we argue that the SDR implies a minimum-dissipation principle for driven Potts models as the dynamics selects stable non-equilibrium states with least dissipation. This principle holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium, for any stochastic dynamics, and for all $q$.</p>

            <h2>Noncollinear phase of the antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Rausch, C. Karrasch</p>
            <p>The antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain is a prototypical example of a frustrated spin system with vertex-sharing triangles, giving rise to complex quantum states. Depending on the interaction parameters, this system has three phases, of which the gapless non-collinear phase (for strongly coupled basal spins and loosely attached apical spins) has received little theoretical attention so far. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the properties of the non-collinear phase using large-scale tensor network computations which exploit the full SU(2) symmetry of the underlying Heisenberg model. We study the ground state both for finite systems using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as well as for infinite chains via the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism. Finite temperatures and correlation functions are tackled via imaginary- or real time evolutions, which we implement using the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP). We find that the non-collinear phase is characterized by a low-momentum peak and a diffuse tail for the apex-apex correlations. Deep into the phase, the pattern sharpens into a peak indicating a 90-degree spiral. The apical spins are soft and highly susceptible to external perturbations; they give rise to a large number of gapless magnetic states that are polarized by weak fields and cause a long low-temperature tail in the specific heat. The dynamic spin-structure factor exhibits additive contributions from a two-spinon continuum (excitations of the basal chain) and a gapless peak at $k=\pi/2$ (excitations of the apical spins). Small temperatures excite the gapless states and smear the spectral weight of the $k=\pi/2$ peak out into a homogeneous flat-band structure. Our results are relevant, e.g., for the material atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ in high magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>A new implementation of many-body calculations is of paramount importance in the field of computational physics. In this study, we leverage the capabilities of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for conducting quantum many-body calculations. Through the design of appropriate schemes for Monte Carlo and tensor network methods, we effectively utilize the parallel processing capabilities provided by FPGAs. This has resulted in a tenfold speedup compared to CPU-based computation for a Monte Carlo algorithm. By using a supercell structure and simulating the FPGA architecture on a CPU with High-Level Synthesis, we achieve $O(1)$ scaling for the time of one sweep, regardless of the overall system size. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of FPGA to accelerate a typical tensor network algorithm for many-body ground state calculations. Additionally, we show that the current FPGA computing acceleration is on par with that of multi-threaded GPU parallel processing. Our findings unambiguously highlight the significant advantages of hardware implementation and pave the way for novel approaches to many-body calculations.</p>

Guided by symmetry principles, we present a recipe to construct Heisenberg models for such generalized altermagnets and apply it explicitly for $N=3,4$. Using flavor-wave theory, we compute the excitation spectrum of a two-dimensional SU(3) model and show that it exhibits magnon bands with altermagnetic splitting according to magnetic quantum numbers; we connect this quantum-number splitting to the frequently used concept of magnon chirality. We also compute the electronic band structure for a metallic system of the same symmetry and map out the polarization of the resulting flavor-split bands.</p>

            <p>Predicting the strength of materials requires considering various length and time scales, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Peierls stress measures material strength by evaluating dislocation resistance to plastic flow, reliant on elastic lattice responses and crystal slip energy landscape. Computational challenges due to the non-local and non-equilibrium nature of dislocations prohibit Peierls stress evaluation from state-of-the-art material databases. We propose a data-driven framework that leverages neural networks trained on force field simulations to understand crystal plasticity physics, predicting Peierls stress from material parameters derived via density functional theory computations, which are otherwise computationally intensive for direct dislocation modeling. This physics transfer approach successfully screen the strength of metallic alloys from a limited number of single-point calculations with chemical accuracy. Guided by these predictions, we fabricate high-strength binary alloys previously unexplored, utilizing high-throughput ion beam deposition techniques. The framework extends to problems facing the accuracy-performance dilemma in general by harnessing the hierarchy of physics of multiscale models in materials sciences.</p>

            <p>The high coercive field ($\mathcal{E}_c$) of hafnia-based ferroelectrics presents a major obstacle to their applications. The ferroelectric switching mechanisms in hafnia that dictate $\mathcal{E}_c$, especially those related to domain nucleation in the Nucleation-Limited-Switching (NLS) model and domain wall motion in the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibas (KAI) model, have remained elusive. We develop a deep-learning-assisted multiscale approach, incorporating atomistic insights into the critical nucleus, to predict both NLS- and KAI-type coercive fields. The theoretical NLS-type $\mathcal{E}_c$ values agree with previous experimental results as well as our own measurements and also exhibit the correct thickness scaling for films between 3 and 20 nm. Combined theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that the giant $\mathcal{E}_c$ in hafnia-based ferroelectrics arises from the ultra-thin geometry, which confines switching to the NLS mechanism. We predict that the theoretical lower limit for KAI-type $\mathcal{E}_c$ is 0.1 MV/cm arsing from mobile domain walls. The activation of KAI-type switching to achieve lower $\mathcal{E}_c$ is supported by our experimental demonstration of a low coercive field of 1 MV/cm in a 60 nm ferroelectric (HfO$_2$)$_n$/(ZrO$_2$)$_n$ ($n=3$ unit cells) superlattices. These findings establish a comprehensive framework for understanding ferroelectric switching in hafnia and highlight the potential of geometry and domain-wall engineering to achieve low-$\mathcal{E}_c$ devices.</p>

            <p>We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, and elucidate the variation of its physical properties under pressure. We fully resolve the crystal structure by single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements using a diamond anvil cell up to 8 GPa, and based on the structural data, we perform first-principles density-functional theory calculations and derive the $ab$ $initio$ extended Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we compare the behavior of the resistivity measured up to 3 GPa using a BeCu clamp-type cell and the ground state properties of the obtained model numerically calculated by the many-variable variational Monte Carlo method. Our main findings are as follows: i) The crystal was rapidly compressed up to about 3 GPa where the volume drops to 80% and gradually varies down to 70% at 8 GPa. The transfer integrals increase following such behavior whereas the screened Coulomb interactions decrease, resulting in a drastic reduction of correlation effect. ii) The degree of dimerization in the intrachain transfer integrals, as the result of the decrease in structural dimerization together with the change in the intermolecular configuration, almost disappears above 4 GPa; the interchain transfer integrals also show characteristic variations under pressure. iii) The results of identifying the characteristic temperatures in the resistivity and the charge and spin orderings in the calculations show an overall agreement: The charge ordering sensitively becomes unstable above 1 GPa, while the spin ordering survives up to higher pressures. These results shed light on the similarities and differences between applying external pressure and substituting the chemical species (chemical pressure).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Kokkeler, F. Sebastian Bergeret, Ilya Tokatly</p>
            <p>We present an effective field theory for a unified description of transport in normal and superconducting metals in the presence of generic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The structure of the quantum kinetic theory in the diffusive regime is determined by a set of fundamental constraints -- charge conjugation symmetry, the causality principle, and the crystal symmetry of a material. These symmetries uniquely fix the action of the Keldysh non-linear $\sigma$ model (NLSM), which at the saddle point yields the quantum kinetic Usadel-type equation. Our phenomenological approach is reminiscent of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, but is valid for superconductors in the whole temperature range, describes the diffusive transport in the normal state, and naturally captures the effects of superconducting fluctuations. As an application, we derive the NLSM and quantum transport equations which include all effects of spin-orbit coupling, allowed by the crystal symmetry, for example, the spin Hall, spin current swapping or spin-galvanic effects. Our approach can be extended to systems with broken time reversal symmetry, as well as to the description of hybrid interfaces, where the spin-charge interconversion can be enhanced due to strong interfacial SOC.</p>

            <p>The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal-symmetry (TRS), have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying small magnetic field as well as tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 1200 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ increases as the cLC order parameter $\eta$ decreases. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% by introducing $\sim1\,\%$ impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is qualitatively insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The obtained giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originate from the non-local contribution from the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are sensitive to the dilute impurities.</p>

            <p>Within a Hubbard model, we investigate the superconducting pairing behavior of infinite-layer nickelate $\mathrm{NdNiO_2}$ and cuprate superconductors by using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method. Our focus is on comparing their dominant pairing symmetries. The results indicate that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is significantly enhanced at low temperatures in both doped nickelates and cuprates, whereas other typical pairing symmetries are effectively suppressed, highlighting the dominance of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing form. Additionally, we find that the effective pairing interaction for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing in doped nickelates is slightly lower than that in doped cuprates, which may be attributed to the different degrees of Fermi surface warping caused by the third-nearest hopping $t''$. Further studies show that the hole doping and interaction strength have significant effects on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction within the selected parameter range. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is notably weakened when the hole doping increases, whereas it is significantly enhanced with increasing Coulomb interaction strength $U$. This comparative analysis reveals the similarities and differences in the pairing behaviors of doped nickelates and cuprates, which may provide further insights into understanding the superconducting properties of these two classes of materials.</p>

            <p>The Lindblad quantum master equation is one of the central approaches to the physics of open quantum systems. In particular, boundary driving enables the study of transport, where a steady state emerges in the long-time limit, which features a constant current and a characteristic density profile. While the Lindblad equation complements other approaches to transport in closed quantum systems, it has become clear that a connection between closed and open systems exists in certain cases. Here, we build on this connection for magnetization transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with and without integrability-breaking perturbations. Specifically, we study the question whether the time evolution of the open quantum system can be described on the basis of classical correlation functions, as generated by the Hamiltonian equations of motion for real vectors. By comparing to exact numerical simulations of the Lindblad equation, we find a good accuracy of such a description for a range of model parameters, which is consistent with previous studies on closed systems. While this agreement is an interesting physical observation, it also suggests that classical mechanics can be used to solve the Lindblad equation for comparatively large system sizes, which lie outside the possibilities of a quantum mechanical treatment. We also point out counterexamples and limitations for the quantitative extraction of transport coefficients. Remarkably, our classical approach to large open systems allows to detect superdiffusion at the isotropic point.</p>

            <h2>Learning local equivariant representations for quantum operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhanghao Zhouyin, Zixi Gan, MingKang Liu, Shishir Kumar Pandey, Linfeng Zhang, Qiangqiang Gu</p>
            <p>Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial for material science. Current methods often focus on individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictly localized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based design for equivariant representations of quantum tensors while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependency without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution and invariant overlap parameterization, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$ orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data. SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</p>

We focus on analytical and numerical methods developed for calculating, computing, and tracking drop deformation en route to developing constitutive models for flowing emulsions. We identify material properties and dimensionless parameters, collate the small deformation theories and resulting expressions for viscometric quantities, list theoretical and numerical methods, and take stock of challenges for capturing connections between drop deformation, morphology, and rheology of emulsions. We highlight the substantial progress in providing quantitative descriptions of the rheological response using analytical theories, dimensional analysis, and powerful computational fluid dynamics to determine how macroscopic rheological properties emerge from microscopic features, including deformation and dynamics of non-interacting or interacting drops and molecular aspects that control the interfacial properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Hardy, Olivier Parcollet, Antoine Georges, Aavishkar A. Patel</p>
            <p>We solve a model of electrons with Hubbard-$U$ Coulomb repulsion and a random Yukawa coupling to a two-dimensional bosonic bath, using an extended dynamical mean field theory scheme. Our model exhibits a quantum critical point, at which the repulsive component of the electron interactions strongly enhances the effects of the quantum critical bosonic fluctuations on the electrons, leading to a breakdown of Fermi liquid physics and the formation of a strange metal with `Planckian' ($\mathcal{O}(k_B T/\hbar)$) quasiparticle decay rates at low temperatures $T\rightarrow 0$. Furthermore, the eventual Mott transition that occurs as the repulsion is increased seemingly bounds the maximum decay rate in the strange metal. Our results provide insight into low-temperature strange metallicity observed in proximity to a Mott transition, as is observed, for instance, in recent experiments on certain moiré materials.</p>

            <p>Recent experimental and theoretical development in the Quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene showed that the previous model of the valley-anisotropy interaction is incomplete, as it was assumed to be ultra-short range (USR). In this work, we use exact diagonalization to go beyond the ultra-short range to find the different phases for $\nu=2/3$. We model the interaction as Yukawa so that we can control the range as a proof of concept. Even in this simple setting, we discovered how dropping the USR condition shifts the transition borders in favour of certain phases, leads to a new bond-ordered phase appearing, and breaks the ferromagnetic phase in two competing states as a result of lifting the USR-driven degeneracy.</p>

            <h2>Nonlocal Moments in the Chern Bands of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick J. Ledwith, Junkai Dong, Ashvin Vishwanath, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has elements in common with two paradigmatic examples of strongly correlated physics: quantum Hall physics and Hubbard physics. On one hand, TBG hosts flat topological Landau-level-like bands which exhibits quantum anomalous Hall effects. On the other hand, these bands have concentrated charge density and show signs of extensive entropy resembling local moments. The combination of these features leads to a question: can decoupled moments emerge in an isolated topological band, despite the lack of exponentially localized Wannier states? In this work, we answer the question affirmatively by proposing a minimal model for these bands in TBG that combines topology and charge concentration at the AA sites, leading to analytic wavefunctions that closely approximate those of the BM model with realistic parameters. Importantly, charge concentration also leads to Berry curvature concentration at $\Gamma$, generating a small parameter $s$ that yields analytic tractability. We show that, rather surprisingly, the model hosts nearly decoupled flavor moments without any extra degrees of freedom. These moments are non-local due to topology-enforced power-law tails, yet have parametrically small overlap. We further develop a diagrammatic expansion in which the self energy can be computed exactly to leading order in $s^2$ in the fluctuating moment regime. At charge neutrality, we find a "Mott semimetal", with large flavor entropy and a Mott gap everywhere in the BZ except for the vicinity of the $\Gamma$ point. Away from neutrality, the Mott semimetal gaps out in a spectrally imbalanced manner, with one Mott band having zero $Z_k$ at the $\Gamma$ point. The model accurately reproduces results from finite temperature thermodynamic measurements, leads to new experimental predictions, and resolves the problem of the emergence of Hubbard physics in isolated topological bands.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihe Yang, Kunling Zhou, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu</p>
            <p>The interplay between topological localization and non-Hermiticity localization in non-Hermitian crystal systems results in a diversity of shapes of topological edge modes (EMs), offering opportunities to manipulate these modes for potential topological applications. The characterization of the domain of EMs and the engineering of these EMs require detailed information about their wave functions, which conventional calculation of topological invariants cannot provide. In this Letter, by recognizing EMs as specified solutions of eigenequation, we derive their wave functions in an extended non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We then inversely construct a winding tuple $\left \{ w_{\scriptscriptstyle GBZ},w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}\right \} $ that characterizes the existence of EMs and their spatial distribution. Moreover, we define a novel spectral winding number equivalent to $w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}$, which is determined by the product of energies of different bands. The inverse design of topological invariants allows us to categorize the localized nature of EMs even in systems lacking sublattice symmetry, which can facilitate the manipulation and utilization of EMs in the development of novel quantum materials and devices.</p>

            <p>Disordered lattice spin systems are crucial in both theoretical and applied physics. However, understanding their properties poses significant challenges for Monte Carlo simulations. In this work, we investigate the two-dimensional random-bond Ising model using the recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method. This method generates biased samples from conditional probabilities computed via tensor network contractions and corrects the bias using the Metropolis scheme. Consequently, the proposals provided by tensor networks function as block updates for Monte Carlo simulations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that TNMC simulations can be performed on lattices as large as $1024\times 1024$ spins with moderate computational resources, a substantial increase from the previous maximum size of $64\times 64$ in MCMC. Notably, we observe an almost complete absence of critical slowing down, enabling the efficient collection of unbiased samples and averaging over a large number of random realizations of bond disorders. We successfully pinpoint the multi-critical point along the Nishimori line with significant precision and accurately determined the bulk and surface critical exponents. Our findings suggest that TNMC is a highly efficient algorithm for exploring disordered and frustrated systems in two dimensions.</p>

            <p>We consider Bloch states of weak spacetime-periodic perturbations of homogeneous materials in one spatial dimension. The interplay of space- and time-periodicity leads to an infinitely degenerate dispersion relation in the free case. We consider a general perturbation term, and, as consequence of the infinite degeneracy, we show that the effective equations are given by the eigenvalue problem of an infinite matrix. Our method can be viewed as a time-modulated generalisation of the nearly-free electron model. Based on this result, we find that the infinite degeneracy may split into a family of non-degenerate bands. Our results are illustrated with numerical calculations, and we observe close agreement between the perturbation theory and the numerically computed full solution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason G. Kattan, Alistair H. Duff, J. E. Sipe</p>
            <p>We derive the macroscopic charge and current densities of a Chern insulator initially occupying its electronic ground state as it responds to a finite-frequency electric field; we use a previously developed formalism based on microscopic polarization and magnetization fields in extended media. In a topologically trivial insulator, our result reduces to the familiar expression for the induced current density in linear response obtained from a Kubo analysis. But for a Chern insulator we find an extra "topological" term involving the (first) Chern number associated with the occupied bands, encoding the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the presence of a frequency-dependent electric field. While an analogous term has been introduced in the "modern theories of polarization and magnetization" for the linear response of finite-sized systems to static electric fields, our expression is valid for bulk Chern insulators in the presence of both static and finite-frequency electric fields, being derived analytically from a microscopic treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom, and can be generalized in a straightforward way to describe the response of a Chern insulator to electromagnetic fields that are not only frequency-dependent but also spatially inhomogeneous.</p>

            <p>Kagome materials are known for hosting exotic quantum states, including quantum spin liquids, charge density waves, and unconventional superconductivity. The search for kagome monolayers is driven by their ability to exhibit neat and well-defined kagome bands near the Fermi level, which are more easily realized in the absence of interlayer interactions. However, this absence also destabilizes the monolayer forms of many bulk kagome materials, posing significant challenges to their discovery. In this work, we propose a strategy to address this challenge by utilizing oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides within a "1+3" design framework. Through high-throughput computational screening of 349 candidate materials, we identified 12 thermodynamically stable kagome monolayers with diverse electronic and magnetic properties. These materials were classified into three categories based on their lattice geometry, symmetry, band gaps, and magnetic configurations. Detailed analysis of three representative monolayers revealed kagome band features near their Fermi levels, with orbital contributions varying between oxygen 2p and transition metal d states. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the "1+3" strategy, offering a promising approach to uncovering low-dimensional kagome materials and advancing the exploration of their quantum phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David M T Kuo</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</p>

            <h2>On the time complexity analysis of numerical percolation threshold estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel García Solla</p>
            <p>The main purpose of percolation theory is to model phase transitions in a variety of random systems, which is highly valuable in fields related to materials physics, biology, or otherwise unrelated areas like oil extraction or even quantum computing. Thus, one of the problems encountered is the calculation of the threshold at which such transition occurs, known as percolation threshold. Since there are no known closed forms to determine the threshold in an exact manner in systems with particular properties, it is decided to rely on numerical methods as the Monte Carlo approach, which provides a sufficiently accurate approximation to serve as a valid estimate in the projects or research where it is involved. However, in order to achieve an exact characterization of the threshold in two-dimensional systems with site percolation, in this work it is performed an analysis of the complexity, both temporal and spatial, of an algorithm that implements its computation from the aforementioned numerical method. Specifically, the conduction of an accurate analysis of the cost of such algorithm implies a deep enough knowledge about certain metrics regarding its duration, or work completed per iteration, which along with its formalization may contribute to the determination of the threshold based on these metrics. Nevertheless, as a result, various bounds are achieved for the best, average and worst cases of the execution on systems spanning several dimensions, revealing that in 1 and 2 the complexity is directly conditioned by the duration, although from 3 onwards no proof for this point has been found, notwithstanding the evidence suggesting its compliance. Furthermore, based on the average case, several methods are proposed that could be applied to characterize the threshold, although they have not been thoroughly explored beyond what is necessary for the complexity analysis.</p>

            <p>The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations in the presence of quenched random disorder is a long-standing open theoretical problem which has been made more urgent by advances in modern experimental techniques. The fragility of charge density wave order to impurities makes this problem of particular interest in understanding a host of real materials, including the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. To address this question, we consider the quantum version of an exactly solvable classical model of two-dimensional randomly pinned incommensurate charge density waves first introduced by us in a recent work, and use the large-$N$ technique to obtain the phase diagram and order parameter correlations. Our theory considers quantum and thermal fluctuations and disorder on equal footing by accounting for all effects non-perturbatively, which reveals a novel crossover between under-damped and over-damped dynamics of the fluctuations of the charge density wave order parameter.</p>

            <p>Scale-free localization in non-Hermitian systems is a distinctive type of localization where the localization length of certain eigenstates, known as scale-free localized (SFL) states, scales proportionally with the system size. Unlike skin states, where the localization length is independent of the system size, SFL states maintain a spatial profile that remains invariant as the system size changes. We consider a model involving a single non-Hermitian impurity in an otherwise Hermitian one-dimensional lattice. Introducing disorder into this system transforms SFL states into Anderson-localized states. In contrast to the Hatano-Nelson model, where disorder typically leads to the localization of skin states and a size-independent Anderson transition, the scale-free localization in our model causes a size-dependent Anderson transition.</p>

            <p>Within the canonical ensemble framework, this paper investigates the presence of higher-order transition signals in the $q$-state Potts model (for $q \geq 3$), using two geometric order parameters: isolated spins number and the average perimeter of clusters. Our results confirm that higher-order transitions exist in the Potts model, where the number of isolated spins reliably indicates third-order independent transitions. This signal persists regardless of the system's phase transition order, even at higher values of $q$. In contrast, the average perimeter of clusters, used as an order parameter for detecting third-order dependent transitions, shows that for $q = 6$ and $q = 8$, the signal for third-order dependent transitions disappears, indicating its absence in systems undergoing first-order transitions. These findings are consistent with results from microcanonical inflection-point analysis, further validating the robustness of this approach.</p>

            <p>Extended defects such as dislocation networks and general grain boundaries are ubiquitous in metals, and accurately modeling these extensive defects is crucial for understanding their deformation mechanisms. Existing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often fall short in adequately describing these defects, as their significant characteristic sizes exceed the computational limits of first-principles calculations. In this study, we address these challenges by establishing a comprehensive defect genome through empirical interatomic potential-guided sampling. To further enable accurate first-principles calculations on this defect genome, we have developed an automated configuration reconstruction technique. This method transforms defect atomic clusters into periodic configurations through precise atom insertion, utilizing Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. These strategies enable the development of highly accurate and transferable MLIPs for modeling extensive defects in metals. Using body-centered cubic tungsten as a model system, we develop an MLIP that reveals unique plastic mechanisms in simulations of nanoindentation. This framework not only improves the modeling accuracy of extensive defects in crystalline materials but also establishes a robust foundation for further advancement of MLIP development through the strategic use of defect genomes.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in scanning electron microscope (SEM) based Kikuchi diffraction have demonstrated the important potential for reflection and transmission methods, like transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Furthermore, with the advent of compact direct electron detectors (DED) it has been possible to place the detector in a variety of configurations within the SEM chamber. This motivates the present work where we explore the similarities and differences of the different geometries that include on-axis TKD & off-axis TKD using electron transparent samples, as well as more conventional EBSD. Furthermore, we compare these with the newest method called "reflection Kikuchi diffraction" RKD where the sample is placed flat in the chamber and the detector is placed below the pole piece. Through remapping collected diffraction patterns, all these methods can be used to generate an experimental "diffraction sphere" that can be used to explore diffraction from any scattering vector from the unit cell, as well as the ability to perform band profile analysis. This diffraction sphere approach enables us to further probe specific differences between the methods, including for example thickness effects in TKD that can result in the generation of diffraction spots, as well as electron scattering path length effects that result in excess and deficiency variations, as well as inversion of bands in experimental patterns.</p>

            <p>A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. broken detailed balance, is central to non-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become "lumped" onto the same observable "state" or when introducing "reaction coordinates" to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this perspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry, and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.</p>

This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.</p>

            <p>Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle well) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by empirical nonlocal pseudopotential theory to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.</p>

            <h2>Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling-Na Wu, Xikun Li, Nathan Goldman, Botao Wang</p>
            <p>Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</p>

            <p>Here we present experimental evidence of the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4, based on specific heat, magnetic entropy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We demonstrate that the two crystallographic Tm3+ sites give rise to distinct single-ion anisotropies, and by extension, SrTm2O4 hosts two magnetic sublattices. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals low-lying dispersing crystal-field excitations, which we modelled using an effective charge model and mean field random phase approximation. The extracted magnetic exchange interactions are both antiferromagnetic and frustrated for both chains. Interchain magnetic exchange interactions are negligible. The strength of the magnetic exchange interactions in relation to the size of crystal field gaps, together with the frustration and low dimensionality, force the system to remain paramagnetic down to the lowest experimentally reachable temperature despite the pseudo-doublet nature of its ground state.</p>

In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of topological $X$-states in the long-time response of a locally perturbed quantum impurity model.

            <p>Terahertz polarizers are essential for advanced spectroscopic systems but face challenges like low transmission, short bandwidths and low extinction ratios. This study demonstrates the development of ultrabroadband THz polarizers using nanoimprint lithography, achieving high performance through double-wire-grid polarizer (DWGP) structures on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) substrates. Compared to silicon-based alternatives, the polymer DWGPs demonstrated over twice the TM-polarized transmittance across the 0.1 - 25 THz range. The degree of polarization exceeded 98% in a 0.1-16 THz range, with a maximum extinction ratio above 65.4 dB at 4.2 THz. Simultaneous characterization of materials using THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) covered extended frequency ranges of 0.1 - 40 THz and 0.9 - 20 THz, respectively. Nanofabricated polymer DWGP revealed the superior optical properties, including enhanced TM transmittance and reduced TE leakage when compared to Si DWGP. Additionally, the fabricated polymer polarizers showcased cost-effectiveness, scalability, and durability, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional Si-based polarizers. The significant developments demonstrated in this study position polymer-based DWGPs as significant components for THz imaging, sensing, and wireless communication systems, paving the way for next-generation technologies.</p>

            <h2>Corrections to the Hamiltonian induced by finite-strength coupling to the environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcin Łobejko, Marek Winczewski, Gerardo Suárez, Robert Alicki, Michał Horodecki</p>
            <p>If a quantum system interacts with the environment, then the Hamiltonian acquires a correction known as the Lamb-shift term. There are two other corrections to the Hamiltonian, related to the stationary state. Namely, the stationary state is to first approximation a Gibbs state with respect to original Hamiltonian. However, if we have finite coupling, then the true stationary state will be different, and regarding it as a Gibbs state to some effective Hamiltonian, one can extract a correction, which is called "steady-state" correction. Alternatively, one can take a static point of view, and consider the reduced state of total equilibrium state, i.e., system plus bath Gibbs state. The extracted Hamiltonian correction is called the "mean-force" correction. This paper presents several analytical results on second-order corrections (in coupling strength) of the three types mentioned above. Instead of the steady state, we focus on a state annihilated by the Liouvillian of the master equation, labeling it as the "quasi-steady state." Specifically, we derive a general formula for the mean-force correction as well as the quasi-steady state and Lamb-shift correction for a general class of master equations. Furthermore, specific formulas for corrections are obtained for the Davies, Bloch-Redfield, and cumulant equation (refined weak coupling). In particular, the cumulant equation serves as a case study of the Liouvillian, featuring a nontrivial fourth-order generator. This generator forms the basis for calculating the diagonal quasi-steady-state correction. We consider spin-boson model as an example, and in addition to using our formulas for corrections, we consider mean-force correction from the reaction-coordinate approach.</p>

            <p>At the interface of Earth's upper and lower mantle, the post-spinel transition boundary controls the dynamics and morphologies of downwelling slabs and upwelling plumes, and its Clapeyron slope is hence one of the most important constraints on mantle convection. In this study, we reported a new in situ experimental dataset on phase stability in Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$ at mantle transition zone pressures from laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments, along with a compilation of corrected in situ experimental datasets from the literature. We presented a machine learning framework for high-pressure phase diagram determination and focused on its application to constrain the location and Clapeyron slope of the post-spinel transition: ringwoodite $\leftrightarrow$ bridgmanite + periclase. We found that the post-spinel boundary is nonlinear and its Clapeyron slope varies locally from $-2.3_{-1.4}^{+0.6}$ MPa/K at 1900 K, to $-1.0_{-1.7}^{+1.3}$ MPa/K at 1700 K, and to $0.0_{-2.0}^{+1.7}$ MPa/K at 1500 K. We applied the temperature-dependent post-spinel Clapeyron slope to estimate its lateral variation across the "660-km" seismic discontinuity in subducting slabs and hotspot-associated plumes worldwide, as well as the ambient mantle. We found that, in the present-day mantle, the average post spinel Clapeyron slope in the plumes is three times more negative than that in slabs, and we then discussed the effects of a nonlinear post-spinel transition on the dynamics of Earth's mantle.</p>

            <p>We discuss scalar conformal field theories (CFTs) that can be realized in structural phase transitions. The Landau condition and Lifshitz condition are reviewed, which are necessary conditions for a structural phase transition to be second order. We also review the perturbative analysis in $4-\epsilon$ expansion of the corresponding Landau actions, which were already analyzed thoroughly in the 80s. By identifying the global symmetries of these fixed points, it turns out that in perturbation theory only 6 different CFTs can be realized by commensurate structural phase transitions. ${\rm \textbf{Updated in version 2:}}$ We discuss how to classify all the phases of a Landau theory using the computer algebra system GAP. We also discuss the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice, where the Cubic CFT is realized. This is a lecture note based on a series of talks given by the author. The goal of the lecture note is to bridge the gap between condensed matter physicists and conformal field theorists. The note will be further updated in the future.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Noise-Robust Losses for Large-Scale Noisy Data Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Staats, Matthias Thamm, Bernd Rosenow</p>
            <p>Large annotated datasets inevitably contain noisy labels, which poses a major challenge for training deep neural networks as they easily memorize the labels. Noise-robust loss functions have emerged as a notable strategy to counteract this issue, but it remains challenging to create a robust loss function which is not susceptible to underfitting. Through a quantitative approach, this paper explores the limited overlap between the network output at initialization and regions of non-vanishing gradients of bounded loss functions in the initial learning phase. Using these insights, we address underfitting of several noise robust losses with a novel method denoted as logit bias, which adds a real number $\epsilon$ to the logit at the position of the correct class. The logit bias enables these losses to achieve state-of-the-art results, even on datasets like WebVision, consisting of over a million images from 1000 classes. In addition, we demonstrate that our method can be used to determine optimal parameters for several loss functions -- without having to train networks. Remarkably, our method determines the hyperparameters based on the number of classes, resulting in loss functions which require zero dataset or noise-dependent parameters.</p>

            <h2>The Timescales of Quantum Breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Michel, Sebastian Zell</p>
            <p>Due to the inevitable existence of quantum effects, a classical description generically breaks down after a finite quantum break-time $t_q$. We aim to find criteria for determining $t_q$. To this end, we construct a new prototype model that features numerous dynamically accessible quantum modes. Using explicit numerical time evolution, we establish how $t_q$ depends on the parameters of the system such as its particle number $N$. The presence of a classical instability leads to $t_q \sim \ln N$ or $t_q\sim \sqrt{N}$. In the stable case, we observe $t_q\sim N$, although full quantum breaking may not take place at all. We find that the different regimes merge smoothly with $t_q\sim N^\gamma$ ($0<\gamma<1$). As an outlook, we point out possibilities for transferring our results to black holes and expanding spacetimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debkanta Ghosh, Keshav Das Agarwal, Pritam Halder, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>The cluster state acquired by evolving the nearest-neighbor (NN) Ising model from a completely separable state is the resource for measurement-based quantum computation. Instead of an NN system, a variable-range power law interacting Ising model can generate a genuine multipartite entangled (GME) weighted graph state (WGS) that may reveal intrinsic characteristics of the evolving Hamiltonian. We establish that the pattern of generalized geometric measure (GGM) in the evolved state with an arbitrary number of qubits is sensitive to fall-off rates and the range of interactions of the evolving Hamiltonian. We report that the time-derivative and time-averaged GGM at a particular time can detect the transition points present in the fall-off rates of the interaction strength, separating different regions, namely long-range, quasi-local and local ones in one- and two-dimensional lattices with deformation. Moreover, we illustrate that in the quasi-local and local regimes, there exists a minimum coordination number in the evolving Ising model for a fixed total number of qubits which can mimic the GGM of the long-range model. In order to achieve a finite-size subsystem from the entire system, we design a local measurement strategy that allows a WGS of an arbitrary number of qubits to be reduced to a local unitarily equivalent WGS having fewer qubits with modified weights.</p>

            <p>We describe a hybrid quantum-classical approach to treat quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. This is done by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCE) with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Here, the VQE algorithm is used as a cluster solver within the NLCE. We test our hybrid quantum-classical algorithm (NLCE$+$VQE) for the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice. The calculation of ground-state energies on each open cluster demands a modified Hamiltonian variational ansatz for the VQE. One major finding is convergence of NLCE$+$VQE to the conventional NLCE result in the thermodynamic limit when at least $N/2$ layers are used in the VQE ansatz for each cluster with $N$ sites. Our approach demonstrates the fruitful connection of techniques known from correlated quantum many-body systems with hybrid algorithms explored on existing quantum-computing devices.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental charges for dual-unitary circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Holden-Dye, Lluis Masanes, Arijeet Pal</p>
            <p>Dual-unitary quantum circuits have recently attracted attention as an analytically tractable model of many-body quantum dynamics. Consisting of a 1+1D lattice of 2-qudit gates arranged in a 'brickwork' pattern, these models are defined by the constraint that each gate must remain unitary under swapping the roles of space and time. This dual-unitarity restricts the dynamics of local operators in these circuits: the support of any such operator must grow at the effective speed of light of the system, along one or both of the edges of a causal light cone set by the geometry of the circuit. Using this property, it is shown here that for 1+1D dual-unitary circuits the set of width-$w$ conserved densities (constructed from operators supported over $w$ consecutive sites) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of width-$w$ solitons - operators which, up to a multiplicative phase, are simply spatially translated at the effective speed of light by the dual-unitary dynamics. A number of ways to construct these many-body solitons (explicitly in the case where the local Hilbert space dimension $d=2$) are then demonstrated: firstly, via a simple construction involving products of smaller, constituent solitons; and secondly, via a construction which cannot be understood as simply in terms of products of smaller solitons, but which does have a neat interpretation in terms of products of fermions under a Jordan-Wigner transformation. This provides partial progress towards a characterisation of the microscopic structure of complex many-body solitons (in dual-unitary circuits on qubits), whilst also establishing a link between fermionic models and dual-unitary circuits, advancing our understanding of what kinds of physics can be explored in this framework.</p>

            <h2>Exact, Average, and Broken Symmetries in a Simple Adaptive Monitored Circuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Li, Zhu-Xi Luo</p>
            <p>Symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding phases of matter in equilibrium. Quantum circuits with measurements have recently emerged as a platform for novel states of matter intrinsically out of equilibrium. Can symmetry be used as an organizing principle for these novel states, their phases and phase transitions? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question in a simple adaptive monitored circuit, which hosts an ordering transition in addition to a separate entanglement transition, upon tuning a single parameter. Starting from a symmetry-breaking initial state, depending on the tuning parameter, the steady state could (i) remain symmetry-broken, (ii) exhibit the average symmetry in the ensemble of trajectories, or (iii) exhibit the exact symmetry for each trajectory. The ordering transition is mapped to the transition in a classical majority vote model, described by the Ising universality class, while the entanglement transition lies in the percolation class. Numerical simulations are further presented to support the analytical understandings.</p>

            <h2>Lowering the Exponential Wall: Accelerating High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts Screening using Local Surface Energy Descriptors from Neural Network Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoya Shiota, Kenji Ishihara, Wataru Mizukami</p>
            <p>Computational screening is indispensable for the efficient design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which hold considerable potential for catalytic applications. However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with respect to the number of constituent elements, making even machine learning-based screening calculations time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a rapid method for predicting HEA properties using data from monometallic systems (or few-component alloys). Central to our approach is the newly introduced local surface energy (LSE) descriptor, which captures local surface reactivity at atomic resolution. We established a correlation between LSE and adsorption energies using monometallic systems. Using this correlation in a linear regression model, we successfully estimated molecular adsorption energies on HEAs with significantly higher accuracy than a conventional descriptor (i.e., generalized coordination numbers). Furthermore, we developed high-precision models by employing both classical and quantum machine learning. Our method enabled CO adsorption-energy calculations for 1000 quinary nanoparticles, comprising 201 atoms each, within a few days, considerably faster than density functional theory, which would require hundreds of years or neural network potentials, which would have taken hundreds of days. The proposed approach accelerates the exploration of the vast HEA chemical space, facilitating the design of novel catalysts.</p>

Comparing with the single-axion model, the shear modulus is enhanced at high temperatures and the shear viscosity is always suppressed in the presence of additional axions. However, the different sets of axions exhibit competitive relationship in determining the shear modulus at low temperatures. Furthermore, by calculating the black hole quasi-normal modes, it is found that adding more axions only increases the amount of diffusive modes.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabrina Aufiero, Preben Forer, Pierpaolo Vivo, Fabio Caccioli, Silvia Bartolucci</p>
            <p>Debt recycling is an aggressive equity extraction strategy that potentially permits faster repayment of a mortgage. While equity progressively builds up as the mortgage is repaid monthly, mortgage holders may obtain another loan they could use to invest on a risky asset. The wealth produced by a successful investment is then used to repay the mortgage faster. The strategy is riskier than a standard repayment plan since fluctuations in the house market and investment's volatility may also lead to a fast default, as both the mortgage and the liquidity loan are secured against the same good. The general conditions of the mortgage holder and the outside market under which debt recycling may be recommended or discouraged have not been fully investigated. In this paper, to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional monthly mortgage repayment versus debt recycling strategies, we build a dynamical model of debt recycling and study the time evolution of equity and mortgage balance as a function of loan-to-value ratio, house market performance, and return of the risky investment. We find that the model has a rich behavior as a function of its main parameters, showing strongly and weakly successful phases - where the mortgage is eventually repaid faster and slower than the standard monthly repayment strategy, respectively - a default phase where the equity locked in the house vanishes before the mortgage is repaid, signalling a failure of the debt recycling strategy, and a permanent re-mortgaging phase - where further investment funds from the lender are continuously secured, but the mortgage is never fully repaid. The strategy's effectiveness is found to be highly sensitive to the initial mortgage-to-equity ratio, the monthly amount of scheduled repayments, and the economic parameters at the outset. The analytical results are corroborated with numerical simulations with excellent agreement.</p>

            <h2>Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Turbulence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian van Kan</p>
            <p>Turbulence is a widely observed state of fluid flows, characterized by complex, nonlinear interactions between motions across a broad spectrum of length and time scales. While turbulence is ubiquitous, from teacups to planetary atmospheres, oceans and stars, its manifestations can vary considerably between different physical systems. For instance, three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows display a forward energy cascade from large to small scales, while in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, energy cascades from small to large scales. In a given physical system, a transition between such disparate regimes of turbulence can occur when a control parameter reaches a critical value. The behavior of flows close to such transition points, which separate qualitatively distinct \textit{phases} of turbulence, has been found to be unexpectedly rich. Here, we survey recent findings on such transitions in highly anisotropic turbulent fluid flows, including turbulence in thin layers and under the influence of rapid rotation. We also review recent work on transitions induced by turbulent fluctuations, such as random reversals and transitions between large-scale vortices and jets, among others. The relevance of these results and their ramifications for future investigations are discussed.</p>

            <p>The need to immobilize low-level nuclear waste, in particular 137Cs-bearing waste, has led to a growing interest in geopolymer-based waste matrices, in addition to optimization attempts of cement matrix compositions for this specific application. Although the overall phase composition and structure of these matrices are well characterized, the binding sites of Cs in these materials have not been clearly identified. Recent studies have suggested that combining the sensitivity of solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) to the local atomic structure with other structural techniques provides insights into the mode of Cs binding and release. Density Functional Theory (DFT) can provide the connection between spectroscopic parameters and geometric properties. However, the reliability of DFT results strongly relies on the choice of a suitable exchange-correlation functional, which for 133Cs, the NMR surrogate for such studies, is not well-established. In this work we benchmark various functionals against their performance in predicting the geometry of various simple Cs compounds, their NMR quadrupolar coupling constants, and their chemical shift values, while prioritizing the ability to incorporate dispersion interactions and maintaining low computational cost. We examined Cs salts, Cs oxides, perovskites, caged materials, a borate glass and a cesium fluoroscandate. While no single functional performs equally well for all parameters, the results show rev-vdW-DF2 and PBEsol+D3 to be leading candidates for these systems, in particular with respect to geometry and chemical shifts, which are of high importance for Cs-immobilization matrices.</p>

            <p>We investigate the absorbing state phase transition in a purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model where the absorbing state itself has long range phase coherence. The model may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W-state with errors. The 'error' Lindblad jump operators preserve the W-state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates, and show that remnants of the coherence persist even after the phase transition to the decohering phase. Furthermore, we argue that the long range coherence of the absorbing state leads to critical behavior distinct from Directed Percolation, the typical universality class for reaction-diffusion models.</p>

            <p>Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.</p>

In this thesis, we analyse the enhancement on the Floquet-induced interactions by many-body correlations, and develop an advanced Floquet method to understand the Floquet-induced interactions relevant for future quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Toward the Observation of Entangled Pairs in BEC analogue Expanding Universes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Agullo, Adrià Delhom, Álvaro Parra-López</p>
            <p>Pair creation is a fundamental prediction of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. While classical aspects of this phenomenon have been observed, the experimental confirmation of its quantum origin remains elusive. In this article, we quantify the entanglement produced by pair creation in two dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) analogues of expanding universes and examine the impact of various experimental factors, including decoherence from thermal noise and losses. Our analysis evaluates the feasibility of detecting entanglement in these systems and identifies optimal experimental configurations for achieving this goal. Focusing on the experimental setup detailed in \cite{Viermann:2022wgw}, we demonstrate that entanglement can be observed in these BEC analogues at a significance level of $\sim 2\sigma$ with current capabilities, and at $\gtrsim 3.3\sigma$ with modest improvements. Achieving this would provide unequivocal evidence of the quantum nature of pair creation and validate one of the most iconic predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</p>

            <h2>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takahiro Orito, Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as Rényi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</p>

            <p>Efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical transduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. To improve efficiency and added noise, materials with larger Pockels coefficients, such as the soft ferroelectrics BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, are required. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. We demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction and reach total off-chip efficiencies of $1\times10^{-6}$ using pulsed pumping. Our novel device concept permits in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss, using a fully subtractive fabrication process with superconducting air bridges. In addition, we investigate optically induced heating, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept and fabrication process are applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and pave the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunling Zhou, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectra in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various types of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.</p>

            <p>Model optomechanical systems with photon-vibration interactions linear, quadratic, and cubic in mechanical displacements are studied under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the photon field. The opportunity of transformation of effective potential describing the dynamics of the mechanical resonator from single-well to double-well is demonstrated. The dynamics of the mechanical resonator is considered in the presence of (i) only linear interaction, (ii) only quadratic interaction, (iii) both linear and quadratic interactions, and (iv) all three interactions, while other parameters of the optomechanical system, the modulation optical field, and the initial conditions remain fixed. Quasiperiodic oscillations of the mechanical resonator in the case (i) are replaced by chaotic ones when the cases (ii) or (iii) are realized. It is interesting that in the presence of all three interactions, the chaotic behavior of the mechanical oscillator becomes quasi-periodic. However, increasing the power of the modulation field again leads to chaos.</p>

            <h2>Exact generalized Bethe eigenstates of the non-integrable alternating Heisenberg chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronald Melendrez, Bhaskar Mukherjee, Marcin Szyniszewski, Christopher J. Turner, Arijeet Pal, Hitesh J. Changlani</p>
            <p>Exact solutions of quantum lattice models serve as useful guides for interpreting physical phenomena in condensed matter systems. Prominent examples of integrability appear in one dimension, including the Heisenberg chain, where the Bethe ansatz method has been widely successful. Recent work has noted that certain non-integrable models harbor quantum many-body scar states, which form a superspin of regular states hidden in an otherwise chaotic spectrum. Here we consider one of the simplest examples of a non-integrable model, the alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic (bond-staggered) Heisenberg chain, a close cousin of the spin-1 Haldane chain and a spin analog of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and show the presence of exponentially many zero-energy states. We highlight features of the alternating chain that allow treatment with the Bethe ansatz (with important modifications) and surprisingly for a non-integrable system, we find simple compact expressions for zero-energy eigenfunctions for a few magnons including solutions with fractionalized particle momentum. We discuss a general numerical recipe to diagnose the existence of such generalized Bethe ansatz (GBA) states and also provide exact analytic expressions for the entanglement of such states. We conclude by conjecturing a picture of magnon pairing which may generalize to multiple magnons. Our work opens the avenue to describe certain eigenstates of partially integrable systems using the GBA.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bhaskar Mukherjee, Christopher J. Turner, Marcin Szyniszewski, Arijeet Pal</p>
            <p>Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of a manifold of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. We construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates in an exponentially degenerate manifold for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. A symmetric superposition of the triplet basis of antipodal spin pairs provides a rich manifold for the construction of states with extensive, logarithmic, and short-range entanglement by tuning the distribution of triplet states. We show the volume-law entangled states despite being in the middle of the spectrum host non-thermal expectation values of local observables. Certain quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and a novel method of quantum state construction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. de la Fuente Pico, J. Levinsen, E. Laird, M. M. Parish, F. M. Marchetti</p>
            <p>We develop a microscopic theory for excitons and cavity exciton polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers under a perpendicular static magnetic field. We obtain numerically exact solutions for the ground and excited states, accounting for the interplay between arbitrarily large magnetic fields and light-matter coupling strengths. This includes the very strong coupling regime, where light-induced modifications of the exciton wavefunction become essential and the approximate coupled oscillator description breaks down. Our results show excellent agreement with recent experimental measurements of the diamagnetic shift of the ground and excited exciton states in WS$_2$, MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoTe$_2$ monolayers. For polaritons, we consider experimentally relevant system parameters and demonstrate that the diamagnetic shifts of both the ground and excited states at high magnetic fields exhibit clear signatures of the very strong coupling regime, highlighting the necessity of our microscopic and numerically exact treatment over perturbative approaches. Furthermore, our microscopic approach allows us to evaluate the exciton-exciton and polariton-polariton interaction strengths. Comparing results specific to TMD monolayers with those applicable to quantum wells, we find that variational approaches overestimate the TMD excitons' interaction strength. We also observe that magnetic fields weaken the interaction strength for both excitons and polaritons, with a less pronounced effect in TMDs than in quantum wells, and that light-induced modifications to the matter component in TMD polaritons can enhance interaction strengths beyond those of purely excitonic interactions.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-breaking phases of many-fermion systems are characterized by anomalous functions representing transient processes during which some characteristics of free particles, such as spin or charge, are not conserved. Matching the low-temperature symmetry-breaking phase with the high-temperature one consistently with nontrivial quantum dynamics is a long-standing, unresolved problem. We argue that the two-particle propagators may contain only even powers of the anomalous Green functions to make the thermodynamic system conserving. Only then can we continuously match the symmetry-breaking phase with the normal one at the single transition point. We use the antiferromagnetic phase of a dynamical mean-field approximation to disclose universal features of the impact of quantum dynamics on the thermodynamic and spectral properties of the ordered state.</p>

            <p>We consider one dimensional many-particle systems that exhibit kinematically protected single-particle excitations over their ground states. We show that momentum and time-resolved 4-point functions of operators that create such excitations diverge linearly in particular time differences. This behaviour can be understood by means of a simple semiclassical analysis based on the kinematics and scattering of wave packets of quasiparticles. We verify that our wave packet analysis correctly predicts the long-time limit of the four-point function in the transverse field Ising model through a form factor expansion. We present evidence in favour of the same behaviour in integrable quantum field theories. In addition, we extend our discussion to experimental protocols where two times of the four-point function coincide, e.g. 2D coherent spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. Finally, focusing on the Ising model, we discuss subleading corrections that grow as the square root of time differences. We show that the subleading corrections can be correctly accounted for by the same semiclassical analysis, but also taking into account wave packet spreading.</p>

            <p>Chiral spin liquids (CSL), which break time-reversal symmetry, are of great interest due to their topological properties and fractionalized excitations (anyons). In this work, we investigate CSL on the kagome lattice arising from the competition between the third-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg interaction across hexagons ($J_d$) and a staggered scalar spin chirality term ($J_\chi$). Using variational Monte Carlo methods, we map out the phase diagram and identify various gapped and gapless CSL phases, each characterized by a distinct flux pattern. Notably, the interplay between $J_d$ and $J_\chi$ induces a tricritical point, which we analyze using Landau-Ginzburg theory. Additionally, we identify potential signatures of these CSLs-including distinctive spin-spin correlations, anomalies in the static spin structure factor, longitudinal thermal conductivity, and magnetoelectric effects-which offer practical guidance for their future experimental detection.</p>

            <p>A Dirac quantum spin liquid hosts Dirac spinons, which are low-energy fractionalized neutral quasiparticles with spin 1/2 that obey the Dirac equation. Recent inelastic neutron scattering studies have revealed cone spin continuum in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. In this work, we further studied spin excitations using the inelastic neutron scattering technique. The width of low-energy spin excitations shows a linear temperature dependence, which can be explained by spinon-spinon interactions with a Dirac dispersion. Polarized neutron scattering measurements reveal that in-plane magnetic fluctuations are about 1.5 times stronger than the out-of-plane ones, suggesting the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and consistent with our theoretical modeling and simulations. Moreover, the high-energy spin excitations around 14 meV agree with the one-pair spinon-antispinon excitations in Raman studies. The real part of the dynamical susceptibility derived from the Kramers-Kronig relationship also accords with the Knight shift measured by nuclear magnetic resonance, clearly demonstrating the negligible effects of magnetic impurities on static susceptibility. These results provide a rare example in studying quantum-spin-liquid materials where different experimental techniques can be directly compared and give further insights for the possible Dirac quantum spin liquid in this system.</p>

The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</p>

            <p>We devise a Floquet theory of longitudinal and dispersive readout in circuit QED. By studying qubits coupled to cavity photons and driven at the resonance frequency of the cavity $\omega_{\rm r}$, we establish a universal connection between the qubit AC Stark shift and the longitudinal and dispersive coupling to photons. We find that the longitudinal coupling $g_\parallel$ is controlled by the slope of the AC Stark shift as function of the driving strength $A_{\rm q}$, while the dispersive shift $\chi$ depends on its curvature. The two quantities become proportional to each other in the weak drive limit ($A_{\rm q}\rightarrow 0$). Our approach unifies the adiabatic limit ($\omega_{\rm r}\rightarrow 0$) -- where $g_\parallel$ is generated by the static spectrum curvature (or quantum capacitance) -- with the diabatic one, where the static spectrum plays no role. We derive analytical results supported by exact numerical simulations. We apply them to superconducting and spin-hybrid cQED systems, showcasing the flexibility of faster-than-dispersive longitudinal readout.</p>

It goes beyond various high-frequency expansion methods commonly used in Floquet theory, as we demonstrate with the example of the driven Fermi-Hubbard model. In the limit of high driving frequencies, the FSWT Hamiltonian reduces to the widely used Floquet-Magnus result. We anticipate this method will be useful for designing Rydberg multi-qubit gates, controlling correlated hopping in quantum simulations in optical lattices, and describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.</p>

            <h2>Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiichi Iwazaki</p>
            <p>Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.</p>

            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

Based on this principle, we have designed and implemented a system that alternates between dissipative and coherent coupling regimes. It allows microwave signals to be selectively transmitted over a large applied magnetic field range at the frequency of anti-resonance.

            <p>Time-reversal (TR) symmetry is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena, and plays a key role in constraining fundamental particle interactions and in classifying phases of quantum matter. In this work, we introduce an ensemble of random quantum circuits that are representative of the dynamics of generic TR-invariant many-body quantum systems. We derive a general statistical mechanics model describing entanglement, many-body quantum chaos and quantum information dynamics in such TR-invariant circuits. As an example of application of our formalism, we study the universal properties of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in monitored TR-invariant systems, with measurements performed in a TR-invariant basis. We find that TR-invariance of the unitary part of the dynamics does not affect the universality class, unless measurement outcomes are post-selected to satisfy the global TR-invariance of each quantum trajectory. We confirm these predictions numerically, and find, for both generic and Clifford-based evolutions, novel critical exponents in the case of ``strong'', i.e. global TR-invariance where each quantum trajectory is TR-invariant.</p>

            <h2>Landau levels in the mixed state of two-dimensional nodal superconductors: models, featured magneto-optical response and quantized thermal Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihai Liu, Bin Wang, Luyang Wang</p>
            <p>Landau quantization of low-energy quasiparticles (QPs) in the mixed state of gapless superconductors is a celebrated problem. So far, the only superconducting system that has been shown to host Landau levels (LLs) of Bogoliubov QPs is the Weyl superconductor. Here, we first investigate the QPs in the mixed state of two Weyl superconductors, an intrinsic one and a heterostructure one, and reveal that the QP states in the former do not form LLs, in contrast to those in the latter where LLs of QPs are shown to exist. The key is whether the low-energy Hamiltonian respects a generalized chiral symmetry. Following the analysis, we show that a twodimensional superconducting system -- a topological insulator-superconductor heterostructure respecting the generalized chiral symmetry -- exhibits LLs with Chern number $\pm 1$ in the mixed state. We also show featured responses resulting from the LLs, including peaked magneto-optical conductivity and quantized thermal Hall conductivity, which could be used as experimental probes to detect LLs in superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Effects of valley splitting on resonant-tunneling readout of spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tetsufumi Tanamoto, Keiji Ono</p>
            <p>The effect of valley splitting on the readout of qubit states is theoretically investigated in a three-quantum-dot (QD) system. A single unit of the three-QD system consists of qubit-QDs and a channel-QD that is connected to a conventional transistor. The nonlinear source--drain current characteristics under resonant-tunneling effects are used to distinguish different qubit states. Using nonequilibrium Green functions, the current formula for the three-QD system is derived when each QD has two valley energy levels. Two valley states in each QD are considered to be affected by variations in the fabrication process. We found that when valley splitting is smaller than Zeeman splitting, the current nonlinearity can improve the readout, provided that the nonuniformity of the valley energy levels is small. Conversely, when the valley splitting is larger than the Zeeman splitting, the nonuniformity degraded the readout. In both cases, we showed that there are regions where the measurement time $t_{\rm meas}$ is much less than the decoherence time $t_{\rm dec}$ such that $t_{\rm dec}/t_{\rm meas}>100$. This suggests that less than 1\% measurement error is anticipated, which opens up the possibility for implementing surface codes even in the presence of valley splitting.</p>

            <h2>Stability of the long-range corrected exchange-correlation functional in time-dependent density-functional theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared R. Williams, Carsten A. Ullrich</p>
            <p>Excitonic effects in the optical absorption spectra of solids can be described with time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) in the linear-response regime, using a simple class of approximate, long-range corrected (LRC) exchange-correlation functionals. It was recently demonstrated that the LRC approximation can also be employed in real-time TDDFT to describe exciton dynamics. Here, we investigate the numerical stability of the time-dependent LRC approach using a two-dimensional model solid. It is found that the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation with an LRC vector potential becomes more and more prone to instabilities for increasing exciton binding energies. The origin of these instabilities is traced back to time-averaged violations of the zero-force theorem, which leads to a simple and robust numerical stabilization scheme. This explains and justifies a recently proposed method by Dewhurst et al., arXiv:2401.16140.</p>

            <p>Artificial Kitaev chains have emerged as a promising platform for realizing topological quantum computing. Once the chains are formed and the Majorana zero modes are braided/fused, reading out the parity of the chains is essential for further verifying the non-Abelian property of the Majorana zero modes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a superconducting transmon qubit, which incorporates an end of a four-site quantum dot-superconductor chain based on a Ge/Si nanowire, to directly detect the singlet/doublet state, and thus the parity of the entire chain. We also demonstrate that for multiple-dot chains there are two types of 0-{\pi} transitions between different charging states: the parity-flip 0-{\pi} transition and the parity-preserved 0-{\pi} transition. Furthermore, we show that the inter-dot coupling, hence the strengths of cross Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling of electrons, can be adjusted by local electrostatic gating in chains fabricated on Ge/Si core-shell nanowires. Our exploration would be helpful for the ultimate realization of topological quantum computing based on artificial Kitaev chains.</p>

            <p>Nickelates have attracted enormous attention since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 under high pressure. However, whether superconducting nickelate single crystals can be prepared at ambient pressure remains elusive. Here we report signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown from potassium carbonate flux at ambient pressure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations re-vealed high-quality single crystals with perfect stacking of trilayers. Resistivity measurements indicate that the metal-to-metal transition observed at ambient pressure was suppressed under high pressure, and a sharp drop occurred at ~30 K at 77.9 GPa, consistent with superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10 single crystals grown by the floating zone method at an oxygen pressure of >18 bar. Our results not only provide an important path to prepare high-quality nickelate single crystals but also support superconductivity in nickelates under high pressure, promoting more systematic and in-depth research in this compelling field.</p>

            <p>Topologically nontrivial electronic states can give rise to novel anomalous Hall effects. The potential appearance of these effects at room temperature holds promise for their application in magnetic sensing, spintronics, and energy harvesting technology. The anomalous in-plane Hall effect (IPHE) is predicted to arise in topological magnetic materials when an external magnetic field is applied within the sample plane. Because of stringent symmetry requirements, the conclusive detection of the anomalous IPHE induced by topological electronic states remains challenging, and the study of anomalous Hall effects is often confined to cryogenic conditions. Combining molecular beam epitaxy of the kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn with measurements of the electric Hall effect and theoretical calculations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate that the interplay of the kagome lattice motif with spin-orbit coupling and canted ferromagnetism with large exchange interactions gives rise to the anomalous IPHE at room temperature that is induced by topological Weyl points in the electronic band structure. Synthesizing a topological heterostructure including layers of Fe$_3$Sn and ferromagnetic CoFeB, we further show the enhancement of the anomalous IPHE through the magnetic stray field of the CoFeB layer. Our work establishes a design paradigm for topological magnets and heterostructures to discover and control novel anomalous Hall effects toward their use in technological applications.</p>

            <p>We report the emergence of a polar metal phase in layered van der Waals compound FePSe$_3$. This Mott insulator with antiferromagnetic order offers a unique opportunity to fully tune an insulator into a polar metal state with pressure, without doping-induced disorder or impurities. Our synchrotron and neutron diffraction data unambiguously show a structural transition and loss of the inversion symmetry. We also observed the suppression of magnetic ordering and an insulator-to-metal transition correspondent with this structural transformation. The loss of the inversion symmetry combined with the pressure-induced metallicity in FePSe$_3$ offers a new platform to investigate polar metallicity at accessible pressures. Moreover, the high-pressure metallic phase shows unconventional resistivity deviating from the Fermi-liquid description, close to the magnetic critical transition pressure at sufficiently low temperatures, which strongly suggests underlying quantum criticality. Our work not only explores the comprehensive temperature-pressure phase diagram of FePSe$_3$ but also provides insights for further investigation of van der Waals strongly correlated magnetic compounds.</p>

            <p>We use magnetization measurements under pressure along with \textit{ab initio} and cluster many-body calculations to investigate magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$. Hydrostatic compression leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling $K_1$ and the corresponding increase in the off-diagonal anisotropy $\Gamma_1$, whereas the experimental Curie-Weiss temperature changes from negative to positive with the slope of +40~K/GPa. On the other hand, spin freezing persists up to at least 3.46~GPa with the almost constant freezing temperature of 5~K that does not follow the large changes in the exchange couplings and indicates the likely extrinsic origin of spin freezing. Magnetic frustration in Li$_2$RhO$_3$ is mainly related to the interplay between ferromagnetic $K_1$ and antiferromagnetic $\Gamma_1$, along with the weakness of the third-neighbor coupling $J_3$ that would otherwise stabilize zigzag order. The small $J_3$ distinguishes Li$_2$RhO$_3$ from other Kitaev candidates.</p>

            <p>Femtosecond laser light can transfer spin angular momentum between magnetic subspecies that exhibit hybridized valence bands within an alloy or compound, and represents the fastest route for manipulating the magnetization of a material. To date, ultrafast spin transfer has predominantly been explained in terms of the initial and final states available for laser excitation. Here, by comparing the measured and calculated dynamics across the entire $M$-edges of two very similar Heusler compounds, $Co_2MnGa$ and $Co_2MnGe$ as well as a sample of elemental Co, we find that simply accounting for the initial and final electron states available for laser excitation cannot alone explain the experimental observations. The influence of spin lifetimes must also be included, due to the shifting of the Fermi level upon replacing Ga with Ge, or the presence of crystalline disorder. This explains why the ordered $L2_1$ phase of $Co_2MnGa$ demonstrates strong laser-induced magnetic signal enhancements across the entire Co-edge, while similar enhancements were not observed in partially disordered $Co_2MnGe$. Although intra-site spin-transfers were expected in the minority channel in pure Co due to the presence of many more available states in the minority channel above the Fermi level, no such signal was observed due to very short few-femtosecond spin lifetimes in a metal. Finally, we identify key regions in the magnetic asymmetry where a transiently enhanced signal could be misinterpreted as a light-induced spin-transfer signature.</p>

            <p>More than fifty years ago, excitonic insulators, formed by the pairing of electrons and holes due to Coulomb interactions, were first predicted. Since then, excitonic insulators have been observed in various classes of materials, including quantum Hall bilayers, graphite, transition metal chalcogenides, and more recently in moire superlattices. In these excitonic insulators, an electron and a hole with the same spin bind together and the resulting exciton is a spin singlet. Here, we report the experimental observation of a spin-triplet exciton insulator in the ultra-quantum limit of a three-dimensional topological material HfTe5. We observe that the spin-polarized zeroth Landau bands, dispersing along the field direction, cross each other beyond a characteristic magnetic field in HfTe5, forming the one-dimensional Weyl mode. Transport measurements reveal the emergence of a gap of about 250 {\mu}eV when the field surpasses a critical threshold. By performing the material-specific modeling, we identify this gap as a consequence of a spin-triplet exciton formation, where electrons and holes with opposite spin form bound states, and the translational symmetry is preserved. The system reaches charge neutrality following the gap opening, as evidenced by the zero Hall conductivity over a wide magnetic field range (10 - 72 T). Our finding of the spin-triplet excitonic insulator paves the way for studying novel spin transport including spin superfluidity, spin Josephson currents, and Coulomb drag of spin currents in analogy to the transport properties associated with the layer pseudospin in quantum Hall bilayers.</p>

            <h2>Universal scaling of electrostatic effects of a curved counter-electrode on the emitter field enhancement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thiago A. de Assis, Fernando F. Dalll'Agnol</p>
            <p>Experiments on field electron emission from single-tip nanoemitters have typically been carried out using a counter-electrode with a finite curvature radius $R$, positioned at a distance $d_{\rm{gap}}$ from the emitter's apex. The effects of the counter-electrode's curvature on the apex field enhancement factor ($\gamma_{\rm{Ca}}$) of the emitter are still not understood. In this Letter, we theoretically explore how the apex field enhancement factor of an emitter, represented by a hemisphere on a cylindrical post (HCP) with apex radius $r_{\rm{a}} = 50$nm, is influenced by the curvature of a spherical-shaped counter-electrode. Importantly, our results show that for HCPs with sharpness aspect ratios typically between $10^2$ and $10^3$, there is a universal scaling such that $\gamma_{\rm{Ca}} = \gamma_{\rm{Pa}} \Psi\left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)$, where $\gamma_{\rm{Pa}}$ represents the apex field enhancement factor for the emitter assuming a planar counter-electrode, and $\Psi\left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)$ is a universal scaling function such that $\Psi \sim 1$ for ${R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \gg 1$ and $\Psi \sim \left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ close to unity, for $ {R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \ll 1$. These findings help partially explain discrepancies observed in orhtodox field electron emission experiments, who reported that the effective $\gamma_{\rm{Ca}}$ values extracted from the current-voltage characteristics of single-tip carbon nanotubes typically underestimate the theoretical $\gamma_{\rm{Pa}}$ values when $R \sim d_{\rm{gap}} \gg r_{\rm{a}}$, a trend that is predicted by our results.</p>

            <p>The quantum geometric properties of topological materials underpin many exotic physical phenomena and applications. Quantum nonlinearity has emerged as a powerful probe for revealing these properties. The Berry curvature dipole in nonmagnetic materials and the quantum metric dipole in antiferromagnets have been explored by studying the second-order nonlinear Hall effect. Although the quadrupole moment of the quantum geometric tensor is theoretically predicted to induce higher-order quantum nonlinearity, the quantum metric quadrupole remains experimentally unexplored. Here, we report the quantum metric quadrupole induced third-order nonlinear longitudinal electrical response in few-layer WTe2, persisting up to room temperature. Angle-resolved third-harmonic current-voltage characteristics are found consistent with the intrinsic crystal symmetry of WTe2. Through temperature variation and scaling analysis, we identify the quantum metric quadrupole as the physical origin of the observed third-order longitudinal nonlinearity. Additionally, we determine the angle dependence of the quantum metric quadrupole, establishing third-order nonlinearity as an efficient method for revealing the quantum metric structure.</p>

Among these, quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as front runners with superior attributes compared to other competing platforms. These attributes are attainable thanks to the robust, two-dimensional lattice of the material formed by the extremely strong B-N bonds. This review discusses the fundamental properties of quantum emitters in hBN and highlights recent progress in the field. The focus is on the fabrication and engineering of these quantum emitters facilitated by state-of-the-art equipment. Strategies to integrate the quantum emitters with dielectric and plasmonic cavities to enhance their optical properties are summarized. The latest developments in new classes of spin-active defects, their predicted structural configurations, and the proposed suitable quantum applications are examined.

However, existing mechanisms often depend on weak spin-orbit coupling or temperature-activated processes, limiting their robustness for low-temperature quantum technologies. Here, we propose a novel coupling mechanism between plasmons and the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnetic insulators, which operates at zero temperature and does not require spin-orbit coupling. Using a model system consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas on an insulating antiferromagnetic substrate, we show that the electric field of the plasmons interacts with the magnetically mediated electric polarization in the antiferromagnet, arising from bonds with broken inversion symmetry. This interaction enables strong coupling to the spin-conserving two-magnon continuum, allowing for efficient hybridization.</p>

            <p>Developing a universal and precise design framework is crucial to search high-performance catalysts, but it remains a giant challenge due to the diverse structures and sites across various types of catalysts. To address this challenge, herein, we developed a novel framework by the refined local atomic environment descriptors (i.e., weighted Atomic Center Symmetry Function, wACSF) combined with machine learning (ML), microkinetic modeling, and computational high-throughput screening. This framework is successfully integrated into the Digital Catalysis Database (DigCat), enabling efficient screening for 2e- water oxidation reaction (2e- WOR) catalysts across four material categories (i.e., metal alloys, metal oxides and perovskites, and single-atom catalysts) within a ML model. The proposed wACSF descriptors integrating both geometric and chemical features are proven effective in predicting the adsorption free energies with ML. Excitingly, based on the wACSF descriptors, the ML models accurately predict the adsorption free energies of hydroxyl ({\Delta}GOH*) and oxygen ({\Delta}GO*) for such a wide range of catalysts, achieving R2 values of 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Through density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling, a universal 2e- WOR microkinetic volcano model was derived with excellent agreement with experimental observations reported to date, which was further used to rapidly screen high-performance catalysts with the input of ML-predicted {\Delta}GOH*. Most importantly, this universal framework can significantly improve the efficiency of catalyst design by considering multiple types of materials at the same time, which can dramatically accelerate the screening of high-performance catalysts.</p>

            <p>The understanding of charge transfer processes in mixed-dimensional quasi-2D perovskites is crucial for their application in high-performance photovoltaic devices. In this work, we investigate the link between charge transport dynamics and morphology in a thin film of quasi-2D perovskites (PEA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1), grown with a distinct dimensionality gradient, where the n=1 phase is concentrated near the substrate and phases with higher dimensionality progressively increase in concentration toward the surface. By selectively exciting the n=4 phase, we observe efficient hole transfer to the n=2 and n=3 phases occurring within few tens of picoseconds after excitation. In contrast, the n=1 phase acts as a hole-blocking layer, limiting the overall charge transport efficiency. These results emphasize the critical importance of minimizing or eliminating the n=1 layer to enhance charge carrier separation and transport, offering valuable insights into the optimization of quasi-2D perovskite-based solar cells.</p>

            <p>Octahedral antiferromagnets are distinguished by crystal lattices composed of octahedra of magnetic ions. In the fully frustrated case, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian can be represented as a sum of squares of total spins for each octahedral block. We study the fully frustrated spin model for a lattice of edge-shared octahedra, which corresponds to the J1-J2 fcc antiferromagnet with J2/J1 = 1/2. The magnetization process at this strongly frustrated point features a remarkably rich sequence of different magnetic phases that include fractional plateaus at m = 1/3 and 2/3 values of the total magnetization. By performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations we construct the H-T phase diagram of the classical model with eight field-induced states, which acquire stability via the order by disorder mechanism. These antiferromagnetic states have distinct spin configurations of their octahedral blocks. The same spin configurations are also relevant for the fully frustrated corner-shared model bringing an apparent similarity to their field-induced states.</p>

            <p>We investigate the pressure-driven structural and electronic evolution of PdSe\(_2\) using powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Beyond 2.3 GPa, suppression of the Jahn-Teller distortion induces in-plane lattice expansion and metallization. Around 4.8 GPa, the interlayer \(d_{z^2}-\pi^*\) orbital hybridization drives the dimensional crossover, facilitating the transformation from the 2D distorted to a 3D undistorted pyrite phase. Above 9 GPa, a novel phase emerges, characterized by octahedral distortions in the $d$ orbitals of Pd. Structural analysis suggests the presence of marcasite (\(Pnnm\)) or arsenopyrite (\(P2_1/c\)) phase with orthorhombic and monoclinic configurations, respectively. Furthermore, the observed phonon anomaly and electronic structure modifications, including the emergence of flat bands in the high-pressure phases, elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying the previously reported exotic superconductivity with an enhanced critical temperature. These results highlight the pivotal role of dimensional crossover and structural transitions in tuning the electronic properties of puckered materials, providing pathways for novel functionalities.</p>

            <p>While the focusing and defocusing Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations have similar behavior in the weak turbulence regime, they must differ dramatically in the strong turbulence regime. Here, we show that this difference is already present at next-to-leading order in the nonlinearity in the weak turbulence regime: The one-loop correction to the interaction vertex suppresses repulsion (like screening in electrodynamics), leading to a steeper spectrum in the defocusing case. In contrast, attraction enhancement (like antiscreening in chromodynamics) makes the spectrum less steep in the focusing case. To describe strong turbulence, we consider a vector model in the limit of a large number of components. A large-N kinetic equation, valid at all scales, can be derived analytically. It has an inverse-cascade solution whose two asymptotics, at high and low wavenumbers, describe weak and strong turbulence, respectively. We find two forms of universality in the strong turbulence spectrum: in focusing media it is independent of the flux magnitude, while in defocusing media it is independent of the bare coupling constant, with the largest scale appearing instead.</p>

We obtain the BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation with external magnetic field and apply the implicit function theorem to it. We show that there is a unique magnetic field (the critical magnetic field) given by a smooth function of the temperature and that there is also a unique nonnegative solution (the gap function) given by a smooth function of both the temperature and the external magnetic field. Using the grand potential, we show that the transition from the normal state to the superconducting state in a type I superconductor is of the first order. Moreover we obtain the explicit expression for the entropy gap.</p>

            <h2>A topology optimisation framework to design test specimens for one-shot identification or discovery of material models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeid Ghouli, Moritz Flaschel, Siddhant Kumar, Laura De Lorenzis</p>
            <p>The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a "one-shot" calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses.</p>

            <h2>Spacing ratios in mixed-type systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua Yan</p>
            <p>The distribution of the consecutive level-spacing ratio is now widely used as a tool to distinguish integrable from chaotic quantum spectra, mostly due to its avoiding of the numerical spectral unfolding. Similar to the use of the Rosenzweig-Porter approach to obtain the Berry-Robnik distribution of level-spacings in mixed-type systems, in this work we extend this approach to derive analytically the distribution of spacing ratios, for random matrices comprised of independent integrable blocks and chaotic blocks. We have numerically confirmed this analytical result using random matrix theory in paradigmatic models such as the quantum kicked rotor and the Hénon-Heiles system.</p>

            <p>We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for Lévy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.</p>

            <p>Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training (CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal structure screening and embedding space visualization.</p>

            <p>Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schrödinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heidar Moradi, Ömer M. Aksoy, Jens H. Bardarson, Apoorv Tiwari</p>
            <p>We investigate the gauging of higher-form finite Abelian symmetries and their sub-groups in quantum spin models in spatial dimensions $d=2$ and 3. Doing so, we naturally uncover gauged models with dual higher-group symmetries and potential mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We demonstrate that the mixed anomalies manifest as the symmetry fractionalization of higher-form symmetries participating in the mixed anomaly. Gauging is realized as an isomorphism or duality between the bond algebras that generate the space of quantum spin models with the dual generalized symmetry structures. We explore the mapping of gapped phases under such gauging related dualities for 0-form and 1-form symmetries in spatial dimension $d=2$ and 3. In $d=2$, these include several non-trivial dualities between short-range entangled gapped phases with 0-form symmetries and 0-form symmetry enriched Higgs and (twisted) deconfined phases of the gauged theory with possible symmetry fractionalizations. Such dualities also imply strong constraints on several unconventional, i.e., deconfined or topological transitions. In $d=3$, among others, we find, dualities between topological orders via gauging of 1-form symmetries. Hamiltonians self-dual under gauging of 1-form symmetries host emergent non-invertible symmetries, realizing higher-categorical generalizations of the Tambara-Yamagami fusion category.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic theory of field-tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev honeycomb model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jagannath Das, Aman Kumar, Vikram Tripathi</p>
            <p>We microscopically construct an abelian mutual Chern-Simons lattice gauge theory for magnetic field-tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev model and obtain a complete characterization of the phases, including their quasiparticles. At low fields for both ferro and antiferromagnetic (FM(AFM)) Kitaev interactions, we demonstrate nonabelian Ising topological order (ITO), and explicitly construct the Majorana anyon as an intrinsic excitation -- a twist defect in our \textit{abelian} gauge theory. For the AFM case, an abelian chiral phase appears at intermediate fields with trivial topological order and fermionic bulk excitations. Remarkably, both the ITO phase and the intermediate phase have the same chiral central charge $c=1/2,$ implying no change in the quantized thermal Hall response across the transition. For the FM case, there is a direct transition from ITO to a partially polarized nontopological phase. Our study completes the proof of Kitaev's original proposal of the low-field ITO with $c=1/2$ going beyond his mean-field arguments by including the crucial effect of the gauge fluctuations, and provides a resolution of the debate surrounding the intermediate field phase in the AFM case.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamali Mukherjee, V Satya Narayana Murthy</p>
            <p>Skyrmions, which are topologically stable magnetic structures, have manifested promising features to be used as an information carrier in new-age, non-volatile data storage devices. In this article, Co/Pt square nano-structure with Co-free layer thickness in the range of 1 nm to 5 nm is taken to study the controlled creation of skyrmions. The magnetization dynamics controlled by the current-induced spin transfer torque help to nucleate skyrmions by transforming the perpendicularly magnetized ground state. This process leads to a stable state of isolated skyrmions via a complex transformation of the Neel wall following its image inversion. Skyrmion numbers vary with increasing thickness as the current density gradually increases. The impact of higher-order anisotropy constants (up to the second order) on the relaxed state of a system, compared to first-order anisotropy alone, has been examined. Additionally, the effect of temperature on the formation of skyrmions has been analyzed for all thicknesses.</p>

            <p>The valley degree of freedom in 2D semiconductors, such as gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) and transition metal dichalcogenides, is a promising carrier of quantum information in the emerging field of valleytronics. While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D~semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times ($T_1$) exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots (QDs) using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.</p>

            <p>It has been established for a long time that the long range van der Waals or thermal Casimir interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics separated by a distance $H$ is screened by an intervening electrolyte. Here we show how this interaction is modified when an electric field of strength $E$ is applied parallel to the dielectric boundaries, leading to a non-equilibrium steady state with a current. The presence of the field induces a long range thermal repulsive interaction, scaling just like the thermal Casimir interaction between dielectrics without the intervening electrolyte, {\em i.e.} as $1/H^3$. At small $E$ the effect is of order $E^2$ while at large fields it saturates to an $E$ independent value. We explain the results in terms of a decoupling mechanism between the charge density fluctuations of cations and anions at large applied fields.</p>

            <h2>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyler Ellison, Meng Cheng</p>
            <p>The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</p>

The system is equivalent to an inertial Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential whose center is controlled by a feedback protocol which measures the particle position at a specific sampling frequency $1/{\tau}$. Several feedback protocols are applied and the power generated by the engine is measured as a function of the oscillator parameters and the sampling frequency. The optimal parameters are then determined. The results are compared to the theoretical predictions and numerical simulations on overdamped systems. We highlight the specific effects of inertia, which can be used to increase the amount of power extracted by the engine. In the regime of large $\tau$, we show that the produced work has a tight bound determined by information theories.</p>

            <p>We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sonja Predin</p>
            <p>The even denominator fractional quantum Hall effect has been experimentally observed in graphene in the fourth Landau level ($n = 3$). This paper is motivated by recent studies regarding the possibility of pairing and the nature of the ground state in this system. By extending the dipole representation of composite fermions, we adapt this framework to the context of graphene's quantum Hall systems, with a focus on half-filled Landau levels. We derive an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the key symmetry of half-filled Landau levels, particularly particle-hole symmetry. At the Fermi level, the energetic instability of the dipole state is influenced by the interplay between topology and symmetry, driving the system towards a critical state. We explore the possibility that this critical state stabilizes into one of the paired states with well-defined pairing solutions. However, our results demonstrate that the regularized state which satisfies boost invariance at Fermi level and lacks well-defined pairing instabilities emerges as energetically more favorable. Therefore, we find no well-defined pairing instabilities of composite fermions in the dipole representation in the half-filled fourth Landau level ($ n = 3 $) of electrons in graphene. Although the theory of composite fermions has its limitations, further research is required to investigate other possible configurations. We discuss the consistency of our results with experimental and numerical studies, and their relevance for future research efforts.</p>

            <p>We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z<1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory for long wavelength phonons originating at dislocations separating domains in small-angle twisted homobilayers of 2D materials such as graphene and MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se). We find that both partial and perfect dislocations, forming due to lattice relaxation in the twisted bilayers with parallel and anti-parallel alignment of unit cells of the constituent layers, respectively, support several one-dimensional subbands of the {\it interdomain} phonons. We show that spectrum of the lowest gapless subband is characterized by imaginary frequencies, for wave-numbers below a critical value, dependent on the dislocation orientation, which indicates an instability for long enough straight partial and perfect dislocations. We argue that pinning potential and/or small deformations of the dislocations could stabilize the gapless phonon spectra. The other subbands are gapped, with subband bottoms lying below the frequency of interlayer shear mode in domains, which facilitates their detection with the help of optical and magnetotransport techniques.</p>

            <p>Strontium titanate is a classic quantum paraelectric oxide material that has been widely studied in bulk and thin films. It exhibits a well-known cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105 K, characterized by the rotation of oxygen octahedra. A possible second phase transition at lower temperature is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, preventing the onset of ferroelectric order. However, recent studies have shown that ferroelectric order can be established at low temperatures by inducing strain and other means. Here, we used in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging to measure the strain and rotation tensors for two strontium titanate microcrystals at low temperature. We observe strains induced by dislocations and inclusion-like impurities in the microcrystals. Based on radial magnitude plots, these strains increase in magnitude and spread as the temperature decreases. Pearson's correlation heat maps show a structural transition at 50 K, which could possibly be the formation of a low-temperature ferroelectric phase in the presence of strain. We do not observe any change in local strains associated with the tetragonal phase transition at 105 K.</p>

            <p>We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</p>

            <p>Biomolecular condensates are complex droplets comprising diverse molecules that interact using various mechanisms. Condensation is often driven by short-ranged attraction, but net charges can also mediate long-ranged repulsion. Using molecular dynamics simulations and an equilibrium field theory, we show that such opposing interactions can suppress coarsening so that many droplets of equal size coexist at equilibrium. This size control depends strongly on the charge asymmetry between constituents, while the strength of the short-ranged attractions has a weak influence. Essentially, droplets expel ions, so they cannot screen electrostatics effectively, implying droplets acquire a net charge and cannot grow indefinitely. Our work reveals how electrostatic effects control droplet size, which is relevant for understanding biomolecular condensates and creating synthetic patterns in chemical engineering.</p>

Our findings generalize previous results obtained upon oscillatory driving and suggest that self-organization and memory formation of disordered materials can emerge under more general conditions, such as a disordered system interacting with its fluctuating environment. The self-organization results in a correlation between the dynamics of the system and its environment. We conclude by discussing our results within the context of environmental sensing, highlighting their generalizability to adaptation strategies of simple organisms under changing conditions.</p>

            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.</p>

            <h2>Kinetics, thermodynamics, and catalysis of the cation incorporation into GeO2, SnO2, and (SnxGe1-x)O2 during suboxide molecular beam epitaxy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenshan Chen, Kingsley Egbo, Joe Kler, Andreas Falkenstein, Jonas Lähnemann, Oliver Bierwagen</p>
            <p>Rutile GeO$_2$ is a promising ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor for future power electronic devices whose alloy with the wide bandgap semiconductor rutile-SnO$_2$ enables bandgap engineering and the formation of heterostructure devices. The (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ alloy system is in its infancy and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a well-suited technique for its thin-film growth, yet presents challenges in controlling the alloy composition and growth rate. To understand and mitigate this challenge, the present study comprehensively investigates the kinetics and thermodynamics of suboxide incorporation into GeO$_2$, SnO$_2$, and (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ during suboxide MBE, the latest development in oxide MBE using suboxide sources. We find suboxide MBE to simplify the growth kinetics, offering better control over growth rates than conventional MBE but without supporting cation-driven oxide layer etching. During binary growth, SnO incorporation is kinetically favored due to its higher oxidation efficiency and lower vapor pressure compared to those of GeO. In (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ growth, however, the GeO incorporation is preferred and the SnO incorporation is suppressed, indicating a catalytic effect, where SnO promotes GeO incorporation through cation exchange. The origin of this cation exchange is likely thermodynamic yet calls for further theoretical studies. Our experimental study provides guidance for controlling the growth rate and alloy composition of (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ in suboxide MBE, highlighting the impact of the substrate temperature and active oxygen flux besides that of the mere SnO:GeO flux stoichiometry. The results are likely transferable to further physical and chemical vapor deposition methods, such as conventional and hybrid MBE, pulsed laser deposition, mist- or metalorganic chemical vapor deposition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Ricardo Filgueira e Silva, Ovidiu Lipan, Fabian Hartmann, Sven Höfling, Victor Lopez-Richard</p>
            <p>Based on a microscopic model of nonequilibrium carrier generation in a leaky dielectric, we analytically derive hysteresis loops for the dielectric response of non-polar, non-ferroelectric materials. We demonstrate how complex dielectric responses can emerge solely from the influence of transport processes that depend on energy levels, voltage polarity, and asymmetries in charge transfer rates. By combining Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and voltammetry, we address critical questions related to the microscopic mechanisms in poorly conductive systems dominated by displacement currents. The impedance analysis, extended to higher-order harmonics, provides deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of dielectric materials, emphasizing the need to correlate impedance spectroscopy with dielectric spectroscopy for a thorough understanding of dipole relaxation and transport phenomena. Our approach provides a fully analytical framework that directly correlates microscopic charge dynamics with macroscopic dielectric responses, offering enhanced accuracy and predictive capability for systems dominated by displacement currents.</p>

            <p>The Goldstino, which is a fermionic Nambu-Goldstone mode, has been predicted in a Bose-Fermi mixture when the supersymmetry is broken. To detect this excitation mode, we theoretically investigate the shot noise of the supersymmetry-like tunneling current in a weakly interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. The Fano factor, which is defined by the noise-to-current ratio, reflect the elementary carriers of the tunneling process. The change of the Fano factor microscopically as the density changes evinces a crossover from the quasiparticle transport to multiparticle (Goldstino) transport. The tunneling channel can also be changed by tuning the potential barrier.</p>

            <p>ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ (A = Cs or Rb) are emerging topological kagome metals that exhibit superconductivity and nematicity without intertwining translational symmetry-breaking charge orders. In this work, we explore the fermiology of their titanium kagome electrons and identify a set of sublattice-pure, high-order van Hove singularities (VHSs) that can suppress charge ordering and enhance electronic correlations and superconductivity. Our calculations of charge susceptibility for kagome bands with both normal and high-order VHSs emphasize the role of these VHSs in driving electronic nematicity in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Additionally, we compute the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon interactions for CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pristine, doped, and kagome-exposed surface conditions, revealing its robustness against structural instabilities while enhancing the superconducting transition temperature. Our work positions ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ as a key platform for investigating superconductivity and electronic nematicity without translational symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals.</p>

            <p>We propose an entropy-related function (non-repeatability) that describes dynamical behaviors in complex systems. A normalized version of this function (mutability) has been previously used in statistical physics. To illustrate their characteristics, we apply these functions to different systems: (a) magnetic moments on a square lattice and (b) real seismic data extracted from the IPOC-2007-2014 catalog. These systems are well-established in the literature, making them suitable benchmarks for testing the new approach. Shannon entropy is used as a reference to facilitate comparison, enabling us to highlight similarities, differences, and the potential benefits of the new measure. Notably, non-repeatability and mutability are sensitive to the order in which the data sequence is collected, distinguishing them from traditional entropy measures.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism effect, the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is coupled to the switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. We demonstrate the design principles for the ferroelectric altermagnets and the additional symmetry constraints necessary for switching the altermagnetic spin splitting through flipping the electric polarization based on the state-of-the-art spin-group symmetry techniques. 22 ferroelectric altermagnets are found by screening through the 2001 experimental reported magnetic structures in the MAGNDATA database and 2 of them are identified as ferroelectric switchable altermagnets. Using the hybrid improper ferroelectric material [C(NH2)3]Cr(HCOO)3 as an example, we show how the altermagnetic spin splitting is tightly coupled to the ferroelectric polarization, providing an ideal platform for designing electric-field-controllable multiferroic devices. Finally, we find that such manipulation of altermagnetism can be detected by monitoring the physical quantities that are related to the non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole, such as the linearly polarized photogalvanic spin current.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rinto Thomas, Praveen Ranganath Prabhakar, Douglas J. Tobias, Michael von Domaros</p>
            <p>The oxidation of human sebum, a lipid mixture covering our skin, generates a range of volatile and semi-volatile carbonyl compounds that contribute largely to indoor air pollution in crowded environments. Kinetic models have been developed to gain a deeper understanding of this complex multiphase chemistry, but they rely partially on rough estimates of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially those describing skin permeation. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the translocation of selected skin oil oxidation products through a model stratum corneum membrane. We find these simulations to be non-trivial, requiring extensive sampling with up to microsecond simulation times, in spite of employing enhanced sampling techniques. We identify the high degree of order and stochastic, long-lived temporal asymmetries in the membrane structure as the leading causes for the slow convergence of the free energy computations. We demonstrate that statistical errors due to insufficient sampling are substantial and propagate to membrane permeabilities. These errors are independent of the enhanced sampling technique employed and very likely independent of the precise membrane model.</p>

            <p>The infinite-layer nickelates, proposed as analogs to superconducting cuprates, provide a promising platform for exploring the mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity. However, the superconductivity under atmospheric pressure has only been observed in thin films, indicating the heterointerface is essential. Here, we employed the advanced Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy-Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) technique to thoroughly investigate the atomic configuration, layer-resolved electronic states and phonon across the NdNiO2/SrTiO3 interface. We found the Sr atoms diffusion at the interface, which results in hole doping into oxygen and nickel band to form a p-type interface. A pronounced redshift of the highest-energy optical phonon (HEOP) of NdNiO2 (~78 meV) is observed at the interface, which is primarily attributed to the epitaxial strain. Our work clarifies that the effects of the interface on electron and phonon states are mainly due to elemental intermixing and epitaxial strain, which could lay the foundation for future investigations into superconducting mechanisms of infinite-layer nickelates.</p>

            <p>We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli</p>
            <p>(2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</p>

            <p>Knit fabrics are mechanically durable and tough while sufficiently flexible to conform to curved substrates such as the human body. Recent advancements in industrial knitting enable unprecedented control over the pattern design and functionality of next generation knit fabrics. However, the ability to leverage this granular control to predict and tune the mechanical behavior of these fabrics remains limited due to their complex hierarchical and entangled microstructure. This study establishes a comprehensive experimental and numerical framework to characterize and model the mechanical properties of industrial knitted fabrics. By integrating precise experiments, finite element modeling, and a strain energy-based homogenization approach, we provide an accurate demonstration of how stitch length, pattern, and yarn material govern the anisotropic mechanical response of knitted fabrics. In doing so, we establish clear quantitative links between these parameters and key material properties, including stiffness and anisotropy, that emerge directly from our energy-based model. Recognizing that industrial knitting systems can produce fabrics with spatially varying parameters, we extend our framework to predict heterogeneous knits. We show that material transitions have minimal impact on the fabric's overall mechanical response, so heterogeneous fabrics can be modeled with our framework as patchworks of homogeneous samples. We design the first industrially knit sleeve explicitly optimized for both fit and function, using heterogeneous patterns that conform to target arm musculature and ensure uniform stress distribution. This work bridges the gap between computational modeling and scalable manufacturing, unlocking new possibilities for wearable devices, assistive textiles, and functional applications.</p>

            <p>This study reports a new meta-stable structure in epitaxial nickel-aluminum (Ni-Al) films (Al content up to 24.4 at.%) grown on MgO(001) substrates by magnetron sputtering. Structure probes by XRD, HRTEM and nano-indentation combined with atomistic simulations consistently demonstrate that in thin film samples with coexisting {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases, domains of the two phases are homogeneously intermixed at the atomic-scale, forming a coherent matched lattice with one overall lattice parameter. It expands as aluminum (Al) concentration increases, with {\gamma} phase domains being progressively replaced by {\gamma}' phase domains. This behavior is similar to a solid solution, where the atomic-scale domain of the {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases act as solute and solvent, respectively. Isothermal annealing and nanoindentation reveal that the structure decomposes into distinct {\gamma}' and {\gamma} phases due to the loss of lattice matching at 400 °C, resulting in an increase in hardness. This is followed by further relaxation and domain growth at higher temperatures (600 °C and 800 °C), accompanied by a decrease in hardness. These observations confirm the metastable nature of the nanoscale {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases system, enhance the understanding of the Ni-Al alloy system and providing new insights for meta-stable intermetallic thin film synthesis.</p>

We construct a minimal $p$-orbital model consisting of the right- and left-handed one-dimensional threefold helical chains connected at $z=0$ with the nearest neighbor hopping and the spin-orbit coupling. The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.</p>

            <p>To overcome the brittleness limitation of ceramics, various toughening mechanisms have been proposed. Some of the most remarkable, especially for oxides, include the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation leading to crack shielding in zirconia, and bioinspired brick-and-mortar microstructures fostering crack deflection. It has, however, proven challenging to incorporate both these mechanisms into a single all-ceramic material. In this work, we propose a computational methodology for the design of a material that combines these two toughening strategies, using a multiscale modeling approach that captures both their individual contributions and the overall fracture performance. This is achieved by developing an all-ceramic composite with a brick-and-mortar microstructure, in which the nanocrystalline mortar is transformation-toughened. Key factors influencing phase transformation, such as grain boundary properties, grain orientations, and kinetic coefficients, are analyzed, and the resulting transformation stress-strain behavior is incorporated into the microscale mortar constitutive model. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of the two toughening mechanisms is achievable, and that it is an extremely effective strategy to boost fracture performance. The influence of brick size, mortar thickness, and properties of the constituent materials is then systematically investigated. Finally, a gradient-free optimization algorithm is employed to identify optimal geometric and material parameters, revealing that longer, thinner bricks with minimal mortar thickness provide the best fracture resistance. Optimal combinations of material properties are identified for given brick sizes and mortar thicknesses.</p>

            <p>Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.</p>

            <p>We numerically investigate the effects of fiber aspect ratio, roughness, flexibility, and flow inertia on the rheology of concentrated suspensions. We perform direct numerical simulations modeling the fibers, suspended in an incompressible Newtonian fluid, as continuous flexible slender bodies obeying the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. An immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is employed to solve for the motion of fibers. In concentrated suspensions, fibers come into contact due to the presence of asperities on their surface. We assume a normal load-dependent friction coefficient to model contact dynamics and friction, which successfully recovers the shear-thinning behaviour observed in experiments. First, we report the shear rate dependent behavior and the increase in the suspension viscosity with the increasing volume fraction of fibers, fiber roughness, and rigidity. The increase in the viscosity is stronger at a lower shear rate and finite inertia. Simulation results indicate that for the concentrated suspensions, contact stresses between fibers form the dominant contribution to the viscosity. Moreover, we find the first normal stress difference to be positive and to increase with the Reynolds number for flexible fibers. Lastly, we explore the divergence of viscosity for different aspect ratios and roughness of the fibers and predict the jamming volume fraction by fitting the data to the Maron-Pierce law. The jamming volume fraction decreases with increasing the aspect ratio and roughness. We conclude that the contact forces and interparticle friction become one of the crucial factors governing the rheology of flexible fiber suspensions at high concentrations.</p>

            <p>Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison with the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state topological order and reveal the existence of nonbosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double-semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.</p>

We address this gap by introducing the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). This exact and compact theory offers two key advantages: representability by quantum circuits and universal applicability to any Gaussian environment. We demonstrate these capabilities through digital quantum simulations of non-Markovian dissipative dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic environments.

Within this framework, we propose that the nature of thermalization, whether weak or strong, can be examined by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. Moreover, we analyze the variance of Lanczos coefficients as another probe for the nature of thermalization. One observes that although the variance of Lanczos coefficients may capture certain features of thermalization, it is not as effective as the infinite time average of complexity.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermodynamics of nonequilibrium processes in lattice gauge theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zohreh Davoudi, Christopher Jarzynski, Niklas Mueller, Greeshma Oruganti, Connor Powers, Nicole Yunger Halpern</p>
            <p>A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.</p>

            <h2>Designing open quantum systems with known steady states: Davies generators and beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinkang Guo, Oliver Hart, Chi-Fang Chen, Aaron J. Friedman, Andrew Lucas</p>
            <p>We provide a systematic framework for constructing generic models of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with a target stationary (mixed) state. Our framework identifies (almost) all combinations of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics that relax to a steady state of interest, generalizing the Davies' generator for dissipative relaxation at finite temperature to nonequilibrium dynamics targeting arbitrary stationary states. We focus on Gibbs states of stabilizer Hamiltonians, identifying local Lindbladians compatible therewith by constraining the rates of dissipative and unitary processes. Moreover, given terms in the Lindbladian not compatible with the target state, our formalism identifies the operations -- including syndrome measurements and local feedback -- one must apply to correct these errors. Our methods also reveal new models of quantum dynamics: for example, we provide a "measurement-induced phase transition" in which measurable two-point functions exhibit critical (power-law) scaling with distance at a critical ratio of the transverse field and rate of measurement and feedback. Time-reversal symmetry -- defined naturally within our formalism -- can be broken both in effectively classical and intrinsically quantum ways. Our framework provides a systematic starting point for exploring the landscape of dynamical universality classes in open quantum systems, as well as identifying new protocols for quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>Message passing neural networks have demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting molecular interactions. Introducing equivariant vectorial representations augments expressivity by capturing geometric data symmetries, thereby improving model accuracy. However, two-body bond vectors in opposition may cancel each other out during message passing, leading to the loss of directional information on their shared node. In this study, we develop Equivariant N-body Interaction Networks (ENINet) that explicitly integrates l = 1 equivariant many-body interactions to enhance directional symmetric information in the message passing scheme. We provided a mathematical analysis demonstrating the necessity of incorporating many-body equivariant interactions and generalized the formulation to $N$-body interactions. Experiments indicate that integrating many-body equivariant representations enhances prediction accuracy across diverse scalar and tensorial quantum chemical properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barbara Roos</p>
            <p>Since Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity is non-linear, it is difficult to study superconducting properties analytically. There is a more tractable linear criterion which determines a temperature $T_l$ below which the system is superconducting. Here, we observe that there is a similar linear criterion which gives a temperature $T_u$ above which no superconductivity occurs. We provide examples of translation invariant systems where $T_u>T_l$ as well as systems where $T_u=T_l$. Furthermore, we estimate $T_u$ for half-spaces and show that it is exponentially small in the weak coupling limit, exhibiting the same asymptotics as the critical temperature for full space.</p>

            <h2>Theory of metastable states in many-body quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Yin, Federica M. Surace, Andrew Lucas</p>
            <p>We present a mathematical theory of metastable pure states in closed many-body quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Given a Hamiltonian, a pure state is defined to be metastable when all sufficiently local operators either stabilize the state, or raise its average energy. We prove that short-range entangled metastable states are necessarily eigenstates (scars) of a perturbatively close Hamiltonian. Given any metastable eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, in the presence of perturbations, we prove the presence of prethermal behavior: local correlation functions decay at a rate bounded by a time scale nonperturbatively long in the inverse metastability radius, rather than Fermi's Golden Rule. Inspired by this general theory, we prove that the lifetime of the false vacuum in certain $d$-dimensional quantum models grows at least as fast as $\exp(\epsilon^{-d} )$, where $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ is the relative energy density of the false vacuum; this lower bound matches, for the first time, explicit calculations using quantum field theory. We identify metastable states at finite energy density in the PXP model, along with exponentially many metastable states in "helical" spin chains and the two-dimensional Ising model. Our inherently quantum formalism reveals precise connections between many problems, including prethermalization, robust quantum scars, and quantum nucleation theory, and applies to systems without known semiclassical and/or field theoretic limits.</p>

            <h2>Hilbert space fragmentation at the origin of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Jeyaretnam, Tanmay Bhore, Jesse J. Osborne, Jad C. Halimeh, Zlatko Papić</p>
            <p>Lattice gauge theories, discretized cousins of continuum gauge theories arising in the Standard Model, have become important platforms for exploring non-equilibrium quantum phenomena. Recent works have reported the possibility of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model. Using degenerate perturbation theory and numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and matrix product states, we perform a detailed characterization of thermalization breakdown in the Schwinger model, including its spectral properties, structure of eigenstates, and out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics. We scrutinize the strong-coupling limit of the model, in which an intriguing double-logarithmic-in-time growth of entanglement was previously proposed from the initial vacuum state. We identify the origin of this ultraslow growth of entanglement as due to approximate Hilbert space fragmentation and the emergence of a dynamical constraint on particle hopping, which gives rise to sharp jumps in the entanglement entropy dynamics within individual background charge sectors. Based on the statistics of jump times, we argue that entanglement growth, averaged over charge sectors, is more naturally explained as either single-logarithmic or a weak power law in time. Our results suggest the existence of a single ergodicity-breaking regime due to Hilbert space fragmentation, whose properties are reminiscent of conventional many-body localization within numerically accessible system sizes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bilal Hawashin, Junchen Rong, Michael M. Scherer</p>
            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking can persist at all temperatures in certain biconical $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ vector models when the underlying field theories are ultraviolet complete. So far, the existence of such theories has been established in fractional dimensions for local but nonunitary models or in 2+1 dimensions but for nonlocal models. Here, we study local models at zero and finite temperature directly in 2+1 dimensions employing functional methods. At zero temperature, we establish that our approach describes the quantum critical behaviour with high accuracy for all $N\geq 2$. We then exhibit the mechanism of discrete symmetry breaking from $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2\to \mathrm{O}(N)$ for increasing temperature near the biconical critical point when $N$ is finite but large. We calculate the corresponding finite-temperature phase diagram and further show that the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem is fully respected within this approach, i.e., symmetry breaking only occurs in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector. Finally, we determine the critical $N$ above which this phenomenon can be observed to be $N_c \approx 15$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wonhee Jeong, Daekyung Lee, Heetae Kim, Sang Hoon Lee</p>
            <p>The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide a mathematical argument concerning the modularity function, the results from real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process. The reorganization is characterized by a local drop in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinghui Wei, Qikun Tian, XinTing Xu, Guangzhao Qin, Xu Zuo, Zhenzhen Qin</p>
            <p>The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. Specifically, there are a total of 26 Rashba semiconductors with isolated spin splitting bands contributed by Se/Te-pz orbitals at conduction band minimum, and their Rashba constant is closely related to the intrinsic electric field and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. As the atomic number increases, the bandgap of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) continually decreases until it shrinks to a point where, when SOC is considered, band inversion occurs and it reopens with a nontrivial topology. In conjunction with band inversion, pz orbitals near the Fermi level can introduce double Rashba splitting featuring a distinctive hybrid spin texture, which can be further effectively adjusted through small biaxial strains and show a continuous evolution of topological to non-topological accompanied by different spin textures. This work provides new insights into Rashba and topology physics and further presents indispensable inversion asymmetry materials for the development of nonlinear optoelectronics.</p>

The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Youssefi, Ahmad Motavassal, Shingo Kono, Seyed Akbar Jafari, Tobias J. Kippenberg</p>
            <p>Dirac-like band crossings are paradigms in condensed matter systems to emulate high-energy physics phenomena. They are associated with two aspects: gap and tilting. The ability to design sign-changing gap gives rise to band topology, whereas the tilting of band crossings which is a gateway for large gravity-like effects remains uncharted. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform to realize tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in large-scale superconducting circuit lattices. The direction and magnitude of the tilt can be controlled by engineering the axially preferred second neighbor coupling. We demonstrate three lattices with 731-site LC resonator featuring tilt values of up to 59% of relative difference in the opposite-direction group velocities. This is obtained by reconstructing the density of states (DOS) of measured microwave resonance frequencies. Harnessing the tilt of Dirac-like band crossings lays the foundation for weaving the fabric of an emergent solid-state spacetime.</p>

            <h2>Driving a Quantum Phase Transition at Arbitrary Rate: Exact solution of the Transverse-Field Ising model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> András Grabarits, Federico Balducci, Adolfo del Campo</p>
            <p>We study the crossing of the quantum phase transition in the transverse-field Ising model after modulating the magnetic field at an arbitrary rate, exploring the critical dynamics from the slow to the sudden quench regime. We do so by analyzing the defect density, the complete kink number distribution, and its cumulants upon completion of a linearized quench. Our analysis relies on the diagonalization of the model using the standard Jordan-Wigner and Fourier transformations, along with the exact solution of the time evolution in each mode in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The free-fermion nature of the problem dictates that the kink number distribution is associated with independent and distinguishable Bernoulli variables, each with a success probability $p_k$. We employ a combination of convergent and asymptotic series expansions to characterize $p_k$ without restrictions on the driving rate. When the latter is approximated by the Landau-Zener formula, the kink density is described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and higher-order cumulants follow a universal power-law behavior, as recently predicted theoretically and verified in the laboratory. By contrast, for moderate and sudden driving protocols, the cumulants exhibit a nonuniversal behavior that is not monotonic on the driving rate and changes qualitatively with the cumulant order. The kink number statistics remain sub-Poissonian for any driving rate, as revealed by an analysis of the cumulant rations that vary nonmonotonically from the sudden to the slow-driving regime. Thanks to the determination of $p_k$ for an arbitrary rate, our study provides a complete analytical understanding of kink number statistics from the slow driving regime to the sudden quench limit.</p>

We introduce the Reynolds number $(\textit{Re})$ and demonstrate that the condensation threshold corresponds exactly to a critical Reynolds number of unity $(\textit{Re}=1)$, beyond which $(\textit{Re} > 1)$ a shock-like front emerges in the momentum space, characterized by the Bose--Einstein distribution for the particle density in states with high momentum.</p>

We report results of micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on RuO2, of which altermagnetic nature has been under fierce debate. We have elucidated the band structure of the (100), (110) and (101) surfaces of a bulk single crystal. We found that, irrespective of the surface orientation, the experimental band structures obtained by ARPES commonly show a semi-quantitative agreement with the bulk-band calculation for the nonmagnetic phase, but display a severe disagreement with that for the antiferromagnetic phase. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES signifies a negligible spin polarization for the bulk bands. These results suggest the absence of antiferromagnetism and altermagnetic spin splitting. Furthermore, we identified a flat surface band and a dispersive one near the Fermi level at the (100)/(110) and (101) surfaces, respectively, both of which are attributed to the topological surface states associated with the bulk Dirac nodal lines. The present ARPES results suggest that the crystal-orientation-dependent topological surface/interface states need to be taken into account to properly capture the transport and catalytic characteristics of RuO2.</p>

            <p>Phonons, which carry circular atomic motions, offer a new route for mediating angular momentum in solids. However, controlling phonon angular momentum without altering the material's structure or composition remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatile switching of angular momentum-carrying phonons by leveraging intrinsic ferrimagnetism in an insulator. We find a pair of chiral phonons with giant energy splitting reaching 20% of the phonon frequency, due to spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. With a moderate magnetic field, the phonon angular momentum of the two chiral phonon branches can be switched along with the magnetization. Notably, near the critical temperature, the effective phonon magnetic moment is enhanced, reaching 2.62 Bohr magneton, exceeding the moment of a magnon. A microscopic model based on phonon-magnon coupling accounts for the observations. Furthermore, we identify two types of phononic domains with opposite phonon Zeeman splitting and propose the existence of topologically protected phononic edge modes at domain boundaries. These results demonstrate effective manipulation of chiral phonons with magnetism, and pave the way for engineering chiral phononic domains on the micrometer scale.</p>

            <p>Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods.

Going beyond this, a hidden discontinuous quantum phase transition from superbunched to coherent states in two-photon processes, accompanied by the bistability within a mean-field theory, is predicted.

            <p>Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) have sparked considerable interest due to the presence of several intertwined symmetry-breaking phases within a single material. Recently, hysteresis and reentrant superconductivity were observed experimentally through magnetoresistance measurements in RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, providing strong evidence of a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking superconducting state. The unconventional magnetic responses, combined with crystalline symmetry, impose strong constraints on the possible pairing symmetries of the superconducting state. In this work, we propose that RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an odd-parity superconductor characterized by spin-polarized Cooper pairs. The hysteresis in magnetoresistance and the reentrant superconductivity can both be explained by the formation and evolution of superconducting domains composed of non-unitary pairing. Considering the nodal properties of the kagome superconductor RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, it is topological and characterized by Majorana zero modes at its boundary, which can be detected through tunneling experiments.</p>

            <p>Muon-spin-rotation ($\mu$SR) experiments and the observation of a spontaneous Nernst effect indicate time-reversal symmetry breaking (BTRS) at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ above the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x\approx0.8$. Further studies have pointed out that BTRS is caused by the formation of a new state of matter associated with the condensation of pairs of electron pairs. Despite exhibiting multiple unconventional effects that warrant further investigation, the electronic spectral properties of this electron quadrupling state remain largely unexplored. Here, we present detailed $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x = 0.77$, which has $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ > $T_{\rm c}$ according to measurements of the spontaneous Nernst effect. The NMR data obtained in this work provide the first direct electronic spectral characteristics of the electron quadrupling state by indicating that it evolves from a pseudogap that sets in at $T^*$ well above $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$. This pseudogap behavior is consistent with $\mu$SR Knight-shift, specific-heat, and transport data indicating the formation of a bound state of electrons. According to a theory of electron quadrupling condensates, such bound-state formations should precede the onset of BTRS correlations between pairs of electron pairs. The second important insight from NMR data is the absence of spin-related magnetism. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1T$ and the evolution of the NMR linewidth prove the absence of a magnetic transition at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ and rule out even a proximity to some magnetic instability. This indicates that the spontaneous magnetic fields detected in this compound are not caused by spin magnetism but are associated with persistent real-space currents.</p>

            <p>Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail Khenner</p>
            <p>Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyses of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to an axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyses without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a pinching singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire separation into a disjoint segments. The time- and electric field-dependent dimensions of the focusing self-similar amplitude profile approaching a blow-up are characterized via the scaling analysis. Also, a weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time- and electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Takahiro Morimoto, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>Rich spontaneous symmetry-breaking phenomena with nontrivial quantum geometric properties in metals represent central issues in condensed matter physics. In this context, the emergence of chiral loop-current order, accompanied by time-reversal symmetry-symmetry breaking in various kagome metals, has garnered significant attention. Particularly noteworthy is the giant electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) in CsV3Sb5, which provides compelling evidence of time-reversal-symmetry and inversion-symmetry breakings. However, the underlying essence of this observation has remained obscured due to the lack of theoretical understanding. Here, we reveal that the loop-current order causes giant and reversible eMChA coefficient, $\gamma_{eM}$, is proportional to the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ times the lifetime of conduction electrons $\tau$. In kagome metals, the derived $\gamma_{eM}$ is substantial and reversible by minute magnetic fields, due to the large $\tau (\gg a_0/v_{Fermi})$ and the field-induced reversal of $M_{orb}$. By considering the experimentally observed stripe charge-density wave, the loop-current state becomes non-centrosymmetric, thereby giving rise to the eMChA. Surprisingly, the quantum-metric, which defines a fundamental geometric aspect of Bloch wavefunctions, acquires significant momentum dependence in the loop-current phase, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of eMChA by $\sim100$ times. This research not only clarifies the fundamental symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals, but also opens a new path for exploring quantum-metric-induced phenomena arising from exotic quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated metals</p>

            <h2>Shear banding as a cause of non-monotonic stress relaxation after flow cessation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vanessa K. Ward, Suzanne M. Fielding</p>
            <p>Recent flow cessation experiments on soft materials have shown a counter-intuitive non-monotonic relaxation of the shear stress: following the switch-off of a steady imposed shear flow, the stress initially decays before later increasing again. By simulating the soft glassy rheology model in a form extended to allow steady state shear banding, we show that the presence of shear bands prior to flow cessation can give rise to this phenomenon. We give a mechanistic understanding of the basic physics involved, in terms of (i) the decay of the shear bands after flow cessation, and (ii) the evolution of frustrated local stresses, governed by different time scales for plastic relaxation in each band. In particular, an elastic recoil in the unsheared band gives rise to negative local frustrated stresses, the slow release of which can cause an increase in macroscopic stress. Given that shear banding and frustrated local stresses arise widely across disordered soft solids, we argue that non-monotonic stress relaxation after flow cessation may occur in many different materials.</p>

            <h2>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Caldarelli, Alberto Guandalini, Francesco Macheda, Francesco Mauri</p>
            <p>We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</p>

            <h2>Rational Design Heterobilayers Photocatalysts for Efficient Water Splitting Based on 2D Transition-Metal Dichalcogenide and Their Janus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nguyen Tran Gia Bao, Ton Nu Quynh Trang, Nam Thoai, Phan Bach Thang, Vu Thi Hanh Thu, Nguyen Tuan Hung</p>
            <p>Direct Z-scheme heterobilayers with enhanced redox potential are viewed as promising for solar-driven water splitting, arising from the synergy between intrinsic dipoles in Janus materials and interfacial electric fields across the layers. This study explores 20 two-dimensional Janus transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterobilayers for efficient water splitting. Using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we screen them based on band gaps and intrinsic electric fields to identify promising candidates, then further assess carrier mobility and surface chemistry to fully evaluate their overall performance. By examining the alignment of synthetic and internal electric fields, we distinguish between Type-I, Type-II, and Z-scheme configurations, enabling the targeted design of optimal photocatalytic materials. Furthermore, we employ the Fröhlich interaction model to quantify the mobility contributions from the longitudinal optical phonon mode, providing detailed insights into how carrier mobility, influenced by phonon scattering, affects photocatalytic performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of Janus-based Z-scheme systems to overcome existing limitations in photocatalytic water splitting by optimizing the electronic and structural properties of 2D materials, highlighting a viable pathway for advancing clean energy generation through enhanced photocatalytic processes.</p>

            <h2>Proof of the absence of local conserved quantities in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain and its anisotropic extensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiro Hokkyo, Mizuki Yamaguchi, Yuuya Chiba</p>
            <p>We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that all systems, except for the known integrable systems, are nonintegrable, meaning that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. In particular, this result guarantees the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, which is a fundamental assumption for quantum many-body scarring. Furthermore, we give simple necessary conditions for integrability in an extended model of the bilinear-biquadratic model with anisotropic interactions. Our result has accomplished a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</p>

            <h2>Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shang Liu</p>
            <p>In this work, we explore an unconventional class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed "deep boundary criticality". Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.</p>

            <h2>Frustrated Spin Systems: History of the Emergence of a Modern Physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hung T. Diep</p>
            <p>In 1977, Gérard Toulouse has proposed a new concept termed as "frustration" in spin systems. Using this definition, several frustrated models have been created and studied, among them we can mention the Villain's model, the fully frustrated simple cubic lattice, the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice. The former models are systems with mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds, while in the latter containing only an antiferromagnetic interaction, the frustration is caused by the lattice geometry. These frustrated spin systems have novel properties that we will review in this paper. One of the striking aspects is the fact that well-established methods such as the renormalization group fail to deal with the nature of the phase transition in frustrated systems. Investigations of properties of frustrated spin systems have been intensive since the 80's. I myself got involved in several investigations of frustrated spin systems soon after my PhD. I have learned a lot from numerous discussions with Gérard Toulouse. Until today, I am still working on frustrated systems such as skyrmions. In this review, I trace back a number of my works over the years on frustrated spin systems going from exactly solved 2D Ising frustrated models, to XY and Heisenberg 2D and 3D frustrated lattices. At the end I present my latest results on skyrmions resulting from the frustration caused by the competition between the exchange interaction and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction under an applied magnetic field. A quantum spin-wave theory using the Green's function method is shown and discussed.</p>

            <h2>Quadrupole gauge theory: anti-Higgs mechanism and elastic dual</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksander Głódkowski, Paweł Matus, Francisco Peña-Benítez, Lazaros Tsaloukidis</p>
            <p>Motivated by the duality between elasticity and fracton gauge theory, we study an extension of the gauge group that includes the quadrupole moment. Remarkably, we find that spontaneous breaking of the quadrupole symmetry increases the number of massless excitations. This result appears to challenge the well-established paradigm, according to which gauge fields acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, and the would-be Goldstone bosons are rendered massive. We refer to this phenomenon as the anti-Higgs mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the quadrupole gauge theory is dual to an exotic class of elastic systems, which we dub incompressible crystals. The anti-Higgs mechanism in the dual theory corresponds to a phase transition from the incompressible crystal state to an ordinary (compressible) solid.</p>

            <p>The separation of colloidal particles based solely on their surface properties is a highly challenging task. This study demonstrates that diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis enable the continuous separation of carboxylate polystyrene particles with similar sizes and zeta potentials but distinct surface concentrations of carboxyl groups. The particles are exposed to salt concentration gradients generated in a double-junction microfluidic device. Through experimental and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate how the particle dynamics are influenced by their zeta potential sensitivity to the local salt concentration, which in turn is affected by surface conductance effects induced by the surface carboxyl groups. Consequently, colloids with comparable zeta potentials but differing surface concentrations of carboxyl groups can be separated with 100% efficiency. This approach, which employs a simple, easy-to-operate device, has discipline-spanning potential for the continuous separation of colloids distinguished solely by surface properties that influence their zeta potential sensitivities, like roughness, permeability, heterogeneity, and chemical composition.</p>

            <p>Understanding and quantifying entanglement entropy is crucial to characterize the quantum behaviors that drive phenomena in a variety of systems. Rare-earth spin complexes, with their unique magnetic properties, provide fertile ground for exploring these nonlocal correlations. In this work, we study Eu$^{2+}$ ions deposited on a Au(111) substrate, modeling finite clusters of large spin-moments using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameterized by first-principles calculations. Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between structures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von Neumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion separation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the conductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the entanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum correlations. These results establish a foundation for experimentally probing and controlling entanglement in lanthanide-based systems, with potential applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Discontinuous Structural Transitions in Fluids with Competing Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ana M. Montero, Santos B. Yuste, Andrés Santos, Mariano López de Haro</p>
            <p>This paper explores how competing interactions in the intermolecular potential of fluids affect their structural transitions. This study employs a versatile potential model with a hard core followed by two constant steps, representing wells or shoulders, analyzed in both one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) systems. Comparing these dimensionalities highlights the effect of confinement on structural transitions. Exact results are derived for 1D systems, while the rational function approximation is used for unconfined 3D fluids. Both scenarios confirm that when the steps are repulsive, the wavelength of the oscillatory decay of the total correlation function evolves with temperature either continuously or discontinuously. In the latter case, a discontinuous oscillation crossover line emerges in the temperature--density plane. For an attractive first step and a repulsive second step, a Fisher--Widom line appears. Although the 1D and 3D results share common features, dimensionality introduces differences: these behaviors occur in distinct temperature ranges, require deeper wells, or become attenuated in 3D. Certain features observed in 1D may vanish in 3D. We conclude that fluids with competing interactions exhibit a rich and intricate pattern of structural transitions, demonstrating the significant influence of dimensionality and interaction features.</p>

Interpreted as a theory of interacting fermions, the diffusion coefficient is the inverse of the effective mass of the quasiparticles which can be computed using mean-field theory. At a critical density \r{ho} = 2/3, the model undergoes a dynamical phase transition in which exponentially many configurations become jammed while others remain diffusive. The model can be generalized to two dimensions.</p>

We have specifically tailored DFTB parameters to enhance the accuracy of electronic band gap calculations in both 3D and 2D lead-iodide perovskites, at a significantly reduced computational cost relative to state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. Our electronic DFTB parameters allow computing not only the band gap but also effective masses of perovskite materials with reasonable accuracy compared to existing experimental data and state-of-the-art DFT calculations. The electronic band structures of vacancy-ordered and, lead- and iodide- deficient perovskites are also explored. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of DFTB in computing electronic band alignments in perovskite heterostructures.

            <p>The skyrmion lattice (SkL) in MnSi was studied using small-angle neutron scattering and under the influence of a radial electric current in a Corbino geometry. In response to the applied current, the SkL undergoes an angular reorientation with respect to the MnSi crystal lattice. The reorientation is non-monotonic with increasing current, with the SkL rotating first in one direction and then the other. The SkL reorientation was studied at different sample locations and found to depend on the local current density as inferred from a finite element analysis. The non-monotonic response indicates the presence of two competing effects on the SkL, most likely due to the presence of both radial electric and thermal currents. Such a scenario is supported by micromagnetic simulations, which show how these effects can act constructively or destructively to drive the SkL rotation, depending on the direction of the electric current. In addition, the simulations also suggest how the direction of the skyrmion flow may affect the SkL orientation.</p>

            <p>1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. This study proves the topological behavior of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ using $k.p$ Hamiltonian and linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a strong spin-momentum locking with different orientations for the valence and conduction bands. Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha<1$ the spin Hall conductivity is the only non-zero term, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha>1$, valley Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI). Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is found for the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ ($N >2$) and Grassmannian nonlinear $\sigma$ models at $\theta=\pi$.</p>

The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tenta Tani, Soma Miki, Hiroki Mori, Minori Goto, Yoshishige Suzuki, Eiiti Tamura</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the flow of information in an interacting two-skyrmion system confined in a box at finite temperature. Using numerical simulations based on the Thiele-Langevin equation, we demonstrate that the skyrmion motion cannot be fully described by the master equation, highlighting the system's simplicity with its nontrivial dynamics. Particularly, due to the chiral motion of skyrmion, we find asymmetric flow of information even in equilibrium, which is demonstrated by the violation of the detailed balance condition. We analyze this novel system using information-theoretical quantities including Shannon entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy. By the analyses, the physical significance of transfer entropy as a measure of flow of information, which has been overlooked in previous studies, is elucidated. Notably, the peak position of the transfer entropy, as a function of time delay, is found to be independent of the interaction range between the two skyrmions yet dependent on the box size. This peak corresponds to the characteristic time required for changing the skyrmion state: the box size divided by the average velocity of skyrmions. We can understand that the information transmission time consists of the time to obtain mutual information and the time to write the information. Since the unusual asymmetric circulation of information is revealed in this two-skyrmion system, it can be a unique platform for future applications to natural computing using flow of information, including more efficient machine learning algorithm.</p>

            <p>We investigate the electric-field driven power-law random banded matrix(PLRBM) model where a variation in the power-law exponent $\alpha$ yields a delocalization-to-localization phase transition. We examine the periodically driven PLRBM model with the help of the Floquet operator. The level spacing ratio and the generalized participation ratio of the Floquet Hamiltonian reveal a drive-induced fractal phase accompanied by diffusive transport on the delocalized side of the undriven PLRBM model. On the localized side, the time-periodic model remains localized - the average spacing ratio corresponds to Poisson statistics and logarithmic transport is observed in the dynamics. Extending our analysis to the aperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driven system, we find that the aperiodically driven clean long-range hopping model (clean counterpart of the PLRBM model) exhibits the phenomenon of \textit{exact dynamical localization} (EDL) on tuning the drive-parameters at special points. The disordered time-aperiodic system shows diffusive transport followed by relaxation to the infinite-temperature state on the delocalized side, and a prethermal plateau with subdiffusion on the localized side. Additionally, we compare this with a quasi-periodically driven AAH model that also undergoes a localization-delocalization transition. Unlike the disordered long-range model, it features a prolonged prethermal plateau followed by subdiffusion to the infinite temperature state, even on the delocalized side.</p>

            <p>Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi Chen, Fa-Jie Wang, Zhen Bi, Zhi-Da Song</p>
            <p>Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic STI - which has no band insulator correspondence - characterized by the half-quantized magneto-electric polarization $P_3\!=\!\theta/(2\pi)$. A $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$. However, we prove that, if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$, the topological state with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ cannot be realized in band insulators where $C_{4}T$ is exact. Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find that an STI with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ can arise in Anderson insulators with disorders respecting $C_{4}T$ on average. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram using the transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessible system size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surface states and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk. As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from both clean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactions cannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped clean system. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to other crystalline symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical electron-phonon vertex correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Marini</p>
            <p>The dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex is caused by the retarded oscillations of the electronic charge following the electron--hole scattering with a phonon mode. This retardation induces a frequency dependence of the electron--phonon interaction. Model Hamiltonians and {\em ab--initio} approaches have instilled the idea that this retardation is, in most of the cases, negligible. In this work I demonstrate that the dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex cannot be neglected {\em a priori}. By using a perturbative expansion I introduce a controllable and physically sound method to evaluate and include dynamical screening effects. Based on the exact results of the homogeneous electron gas I propose a dynamical vertex correction function $\Gamma_{e-p}(\omega)$ designed to screen the commonly used adiabatic electron--phonon interaction. This function is expressed in terms of adiabatic quantities, that can be easily calculated and used to evaluate the strength of the dynamical corrections, even in realistic materials.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Estimation of Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaoyong Zhang, Zhaoyu Fei, Xiaoguang Wang</p>
            <p>Over the past century, the Boltzmann entropy has been widely accepted as the standard definition of entropy for an isolated system. However, it coexists with controversial alternatives, such as the Gibbs entropy. These definitions, including the Boltzmann entropy, exhibit certain inconsistencies, both mathematically and thermodynamically. To address this challenge, we introduce the estimation theory in statistical inference into the study of thermodynamics and statistical physics for finite-sized systems. By regarding the finite-sized system as a thermometer used to measure the temperature of the heat reservoir, we show that optimal estimation of temperature yields the corresponding entropy formula for an isolated system. In the single-sample case, optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) corresponds to the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). These different definitions of entropy, rather than being contradictory, apply to optimal estimation of different parameters. Furthermore, via the Laplace transform, we identify a complementarity between estimation of temperature and system's energy, a concept suggested by Niels Bohr. We also correct the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, as expressed by the Cramér-Rao bound, in the large-$N$ limit. In the multiple-sample case, we generalize the definitions of both Boltzmann entropy and Gibbs entropy to achieve optimal estimation of temperature, revealing the tight connection between statistical inference and Terrell Hill's nanothermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Hae-Young Kee</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review presents a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.</p>

            <h2>High order strong-coupling expansion for X-ray absorption on a dynamically screened impurity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eva Paprotzki, Martin Eckstein</p>
            <p>Time-resolved X-ray absorption can reveal the dynamical screening of the local Coulomb interaction in strongly correlated photo-excited materials. Here, we focus on the theoretical prediction of X-ray absorption in the presence of dynamical screening using the strong coupling expansion, i.e., an expansion around the isolated absorption site in terms of the retarded interaction. The evaluation of higher order diagrams is made numerically feasible by an approach based on the decomposition of the retarded interaction into complex exponentials. With this, we evaluate the strong coupling series to third order on an electron-boson model of Holstein type. We demonstrate that in relevant coupling regimes, even low orders of the strong coupling expansion can give a significant correction over the previously used lowest order approximation.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pieter M. Gunnink, Tim Ludwig, Alexander Shnirman, Rembert A. Duine</p>
            <p>One of the cornerstones of spintronics is the application of a spin-transfer torque to a nanomagnet, driving the magnetization of the nanomagnet into a steady-state precession and realizing a spin-torque oscillator. Such a steady state, sustained by a balance between driving and dissipation, could be a textbook example for a nonequilibrium situation. Nevertheless, most theoretical descriptions of spin-torque oscillators simply assume local equilibrium. Here, based on a simple model, we investigate the relevance of nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators. We use a nonequilibrium Keldysh description, which allows us to treat the effects of spin relaxation, and find that, in the absence of spin relaxation, persistent precessions of the magnetization are not allowed, if magnetic anisotropies are absent. However, introducing spin relaxation enables persistent precessions, where the strength of the spin relaxation has quantitative and qualitative effects on the magnetization dynamics. In the presence of magnetic anisotropy, we find that persistent precessions are allowed even if spin relaxation is absent, but spin relaxation causes a nonlinear relation between the oscillator power and the applied voltage bias. Finally, we consider an alternative spin relaxation mechanism and study the resulting magnetization precessions, highlighting the importance of understanding the exact nature of the relaxation in nanomagnets.</p>

            <p>We report new magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K, a factor of three lower than those previously reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical to a quantum spin liquid regime. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice.</p>

            <p>Stark Many-Body Localization (MBL) is a phenomenon observed in quantum systems in the absence of disorder, where the presence of a linear potential, known as the Stark field, causes the localization. Our study aims to provide novel insight into the properties of Stark MBL and to discover unique entanglement characteristics specific to this phenomenon. The phase diagram analysis reveals different behavior with varying interaction strengths. Furthermore, we highlight the influence of domain wall structures on the breakdown of the entanglement entropy of the system. Moreover, the investigation of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC) behavior demonstrates distinct responses to interactions based on domain wall configurations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Stark MBL and offer valuable insights into the entanglement properties of systems subjected to Stark potentials.</p>

            <p>Small fluid leaks are common and frequently troublesome. We often consider how to stop a leak, but here we ask a different question: how might a leak stop itself? We experimentally study leaking flow transitions from continuous drainage to spontaneous arrest. High-speed imaging reveals that fluid breakup events generate droplets whose Laplace pressures oppose the leak. Early droplets grow unstably, allowing the leak to continue, but ultimately a final capping droplet equilibrates to a stable spherical cap via lightly damped harmonic oscillations. A total energetic theory incorporating both the potential and kinetic energy of attempted capping droplets shows that inertia plays a key role in the leak-stop mechanism. Further experiments examining the stability of rivulet flow in such a system demonstrate that a transition from continuous to discrete flow is an essential prerequisite in determining when a leak can stop itself.</p>

            <p>The Knot Entropy Conjecture states that the exponential growth rate of the number of $n$-edge lattice polygons with knot-type $K$ is the same as that for unknot polygons. Moreover, the next order growth follows a power law in $n$ with an exponent that increases by one for each prime knot in the knot decomposition of $K$. We provide the first proof of this conjecture by considering knots and non-split links in tube $\mathbb{T}^*$, an $\infty \times 2\times 1$ sublattice of the simple cubic lattice. We establish upper and lower bounds relating the asymptotics of the number of $n$-edge polygons with fixed link-type in $\mathbb{T}^*$ to that of the number of $n$-edge unknots. For the upper bound, we prove that polygons can be unknotted by braid insertions. For the lower bound, we prove a pattern theorem for unknots using information from exact transfer-matrices. This work provides new knot theory results for 4-plats and new combinatorics results for lattice polygons. Connections to modelling polymers such as DNA in nanochannels are highlighted.</p>

            <h2>Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a refuge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. G. Piva, C. Anteneodo</p>
            <p>We investigate a nonlocal generalization of the Fisher-KPP equation, which incorporates logistic growth and diffusion, for a single species population in a viable patch (refuge). In this framework, diffusion plays an homogenizing role, while nonlocal interactions can destabilize the spatially uniform state, leading to the emergence of spontaneous patterns. Notably, even when the uniform state is stable, spatial perturbations, such as the presence of a refuge, can still induce patterns. These phenomena are well known for environments with constant diffusivity. Our goal is to investigate how the formation of winkles in the population distribution is affected when the diffusivity is density-dependent. Then, we explore scenarios in which diffusivity is sensitive to either rarefaction or overcrowding. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of the patterns, potentially leading to either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion reacts to changes in density.</p>

In this phase, we construct a decomposition of the sphere into well-separated small clusters, each of which has exponentially small Gibbs mass, yet which together carry all but an exponentially small fraction of the Gibbs mass. We achieve this via quantitative estimates on the derivative of the Franz--Parisi potential, which measures the Gibbs mass profile around a typical sample. Corollaries on dynamics are derived, in particular we show the two-times correlation function of stationary Langevin dynamics must have an exponentially long plateau. We further show that shattering implies disorder chaos for the Gibbs measure in the optimal transport sense; this is known to imply failure of sampling algorithms which are stable under perturbation in the same metric.</p>

Not only multiple global Abelian symmetries can be easily defined and implemented, Cytnx also provides a new tool called Network that allows users to store large tensor networks and perform tensor network contractions in an optimal order automatically. With the integration of cuQuantum, tensor calculations can also be executed efficiently on GPUs. We present benchmark results for tensor operations on both devices, CPU and GPU.

            <p>As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of $>4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a universal method to obtain fast charging of a quantum battery by a driven charger system using controlled, pure dephasing of the charger. While the battery displays coherent underdamped oscillations of energy for weak charger dephasing, the quantum Zeno freezing of the charger energy at high dephasing suppresses the rate of transfer of energy to the battery. Choosing an optimum dephasing rate between the regimes leads to a fast charging of the battery. We illustrate our results with the charger and battery modeled by either two-level systems or harmonic oscillators. Apart from the fast charging, the dephasing also renders the charging performance more robust to detuning between the charger, drive, and battery frequencies for the two-level systems case.</p>

            <p>Wetting and dewetting dynamics of simple and complex liquids is described by kinetic equations in gradient dynamics form that incorporates the various coupled dissipative processes in a fully thermodynamically consistent manner. After briefly reviewing this, we also review how chemical reactions can be captured by a related gradient dynamics description, assuming detailed balanced mass action type kinetics. Then, we bring both aspects together and discuss mesoscopic reactive thin-film hydrodynamics illustrated by two examples, namely, models for reactive wetting and reactive surfactants. These models can describe the approach to equilibrium but may also be employed to study out-of-equilibrium chemo-mechanical dynamics. In the latter case, one breaks the gradient dynamics form by chemostatting to obtain active systems. In this way, for reactive wetting we recover running drops that are driven by chemically sustained wettability gradients and for drops covered by autocatalytic reactive surfactants we find complex forms of self-propulsion and self-excited oscillations.</p>

            <h2>Sign problem in tensor network contraction</h2>

            <p>We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</p>

            <p>We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</p>

            <p>The bottleneck of alloy design for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM) resides in customized powder production - an expensive and time-consuming process hindering the rapid closed-loop design iterations. This study analyzed an expedited experimental workflow, i.e., multipath laser scanning of induction-melted samples, to mimic rapid solidification of AM to serve as an alternative approach to down-select from the design space. Using Al-Ni-Zr-Er model alloy, comprehensive multi-scale characterizations were performed to compare microstructural features between laser-scanned and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) samples. Although demonstrating a difference in melt pool geometries, the microstructures in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)- and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)- scale demonstrate a high degree of similarity, in terms of microstructure morphology, grain size, presence of precipitates, and phase distribution. The mechanical performance was evaluated by microhardness tests. The results revealed a 20% reduction in laser-scanned samples compared to LPBF samples, attributed to the thermal history and potential differences in phase fractions. The decreasing trend was also observed in the benchmark alloy showing a 10% absolute error with respect to the model alloy. This study underscores the potential of this workflow to accelerate alloy design in AM by circumventing customized powder production and encourages further exploration across diverse materials and processing parameters.</p>

            <p>We introduce a cyclic quantum battery model, based on an interacting bipartite system, weakly coupled to a thermal bath. The working cycle of the battery consists of four strokes: system thermalization, disconnection of subsystems, ergotropy extraction, and reconnection. The thermal bath acts as a charger in the thermalization stroke, while ergotropy extraction is possible because the ensuing thermal state is no longer passive after the disconnection stroke. Focusing on the case of two interacting qubits, we show that phase coherence, in the presence of non-trivial correlations between the qubits, can be exploited to reach working regimes with efficiency higher than 50% while providing finite ergotropy. Our protocol is illustrated through a simple and feasible circuit model of a cyclic superconducting quantum battery. Furthermore, we simulate the considered cycle on superconducting IBM quantum machines. The good agreement between the theoretical and simulated results strongly suggests that our scheme for cyclic quantum batteries can be successfully realized in superconducting quantum hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Manna, Vaibhav Madhok, Arul Lakshminarayan</p>
            <p>When subject to a non-local unitary evolution, qubits in a quantum circuit become increasingly entangled. Conversely, measurements applied to individual qubits lead to their disentanglement from the collective system. The extent of entanglement reduction depends on the frequency of local projective measurements. A delicate balance emerges between unitary evolution, which enhances entanglement, and measurements which diminish it. In the thermodynamic limit, there is a phase transition from volume law entanglement to area law entanglement at a critical value of measurement frequency. This phenomenon, occurring in hybrid quantum circuits with both unitary gates and measurements, is termed as measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We study the behavior of MIPT in circuits comprising of two qubit unitary gates parameterized by Cartan decomposition. We show that the entangling power and gate typicality of the two-qubit local unitaries employed in the circuit can be used to explain the behavior of global bipartite entanglement the circuit can sustain. When the two qubit gate throughout the circuit is the identity and measurements are the sole driver of the entanglement behavior, we obtain analytical estimate for the entanglement entropy that shows remarkable agreement with numerical simulations. We also find that the entangling power and gate typicality enable the classification of the two-qubit unitaries by different universality classes of phase transitions that can occur in the hybrid circuit. For all unitaries in a particular universality class, the transition from volume to area law of entanglement occurs with same exponent that characterizes the phase transition.</p>

The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium effects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections are presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface, two-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator. Together, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities. Applications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Superlattice Phonons in Charge Localization Across Quantum Dot Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bokang Hou, Matthew Coley-O'Rourke, Uri Banin, Michael Thoss, Eran Rabani</p>
            <p>Understanding charge transport in semiconductor quantum dot (QD) assemblies is important for developing the next generation of solar cells and light-harvesting devices based on QD technology. One of the key factors that governs the transport in such systems is related to the hybridization between the QDs. Recent experiments have successfully synthesized QD molecules, arrays, and assemblies by directly fusing the QDs, with enhanced hybridization leading to high carrier mobilities and coherent band-like electronic transport. In this work, we theoretically investigate the electron transfer dynamics across a finite CdSe-CdS core-shell QD array, considering up to seven interconnected QDs in one dimension. We find that, even in the absence of structural and size disorder, electron transfer can become localized by the emergent low-frequency superlattice vibrational modes when the connecting neck between QDs is narrow. On the other hand, we also identify a regime where the same vibrational modes facilitate coherent electron transport when the connecting necks are wide. Overall, we elucidate the crucial effects of electronic and superlattice symmetries and their couplings when designing high-mobility devices based on QD superlattices.</p>

            <p>Moire lattices attract significant attention in double-layer graphene and TMD layer heterostructures as well as in photonic crystals due to the interesting exotic physics that emerges within these structures. However, direct measurement of the moiré ground, excited states and Bloch bands in twisted photonic lattices is still illusive. In this work we report strong coupling between excitons in CsPbBr3 microplates and moire photonic modes at room temperature. Depending on the coupling strength between the nearest potential sites, we observe staggered moire polariton ground states, excited states and moire polariton bands. Phase locked moire zero (in-phase) states and moire pi (antiphase) states with different spatial distributions are measured. The moire polariton distribution can be tuned into the shape of a parallelogram by controlling the depth and width of the potential in one photonic lattice with another superimposed one fixed. In addition, moire polaritons in twisted 2D honeycomb lattices are also observed. Increasing the pumping density, we realize exciton polariton condensation in the moire potential sites of the 1D/2D twisted lattices with the coherence time of around 1.4 ps. Our work lays the foundation to study coherent moire polariton condensation in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature.</p>

            <p>Space-time modulation of electromagnetic parameters offers novel exciting possibilities for advanced field manipulations. In this study, we explore wave scattering from a time-varying interface characterized by a Lorentz-type dispersion with a step-like temporal variation in its parameters. Our findings reveal a new process: an unconventional frequency generation at the natural resonances of the system. Remarkably, this phenomenon enables the coupling of propagating waves to evanescent ones, allowing the direct far-field excitation of surface-wave modes without the mediation of spatial gratings or prisms. These results suggest a novel strategy for designing compact and ultra-fast photonic devices, eliminating the necessity for subwavelength spatial structuring or prolonged temporal modulations.</p>

            <h2>Network reconstruction may not mean dynamics prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhendong Yu, Haiping Huang</p>
            <p>With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laetitia P. Bettmann, John Goold</p>
            <p>Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information (FI) with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalised thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we tighten a classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-averaged rate of information change and demonstrate that it also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.</p>

            <p>A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</p>

            <h2>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</p>

            <h2>Deformation of Matrix Geometry via Landau Level Evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Hasebe</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme for the construction of deformed matrix geometries using Landau models. The Landau models are practically useful tools to extract matrix geometries. The level projection method however cannot be applied straightforwardly to the Landau models on deformed manifolds, as they do not generally exhibit degenerate energy levels. We overcome this problem by exploiting the idea of spectral flow. Taking a symmetric matrix geometry as a reference point of the spectral flow, we evolve the matrix geometry by deforming the Landau model. In this process, unitarity is automatically preserved. The explicit matrix realization of the coordinates is derived mechanically even for a non-perturbative deformation. We clarify basic properties of the deformed matrix geometries through a concrete analysis of the non-relativistic and relativistic Landau models on expanding two-sphere and elongating ellipsoid. The obtained ellipsoidal matrix geometries show behaviors quantitatively different in each Landau level, but qualitatively similar to their classical counterpart. We also numerically investigate the differences between the ellipsoidal matrix geometry and the fuzzy ellipsoid.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshifumi Nakata, Yuki Takeuchi, Martin Kliesch, Andrew Darmawan</p>
            <p>We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problems of determining whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design. We show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this remains true even when the set is promised to be either exponentially close to or no closer than a constant to a $1$-design, particularly illustrating that, while unitary and state designs are powerful information resources, it is inherently hard to determine their properties. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</p>

            <p>Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.</p>

            <p>The Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) is a fundamental tool in magnetometry, pivotal for advancing research in optics, magnetism, and spintronics as a direct probe of magnetization. Traditional MOKE measurements primarily detect the magnetization components parallel to the Poynting vector, which can only access the magnitude but not the direction of the orthogonal component. In this study, we introduce an orthogonal MOKE geometry in which the Kerr signal detects both the magnitude and direction of the magnetization component perpendicular to the Poynting vector. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this orthogonal geometry through the MOKE measurements in cubic ferromagnets and van der Waals ferromagnet. We theoretically show that the orthogonal MOKE geometry is enabled by the multipolar structure of Berry curvature in the magnetization space, which generally induces a Voigt vector orthogonal to the magnetization, thereby accounting for the unique magnetization angle dependence distinct from conventional MOKE. The establishment of the orthogonal MOKE geometry not only introduces a new paradigm for magneto-optical measurements but also provides a framework for exploring the magnetization multipoles of Berry curvature across the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

            <p>Magnon blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon for generating single-magnon state, which gradually becomes one of the candidates for quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to generate the magnon blockade in a hybrid system consisting of a YIG micromagnet and a skyrmion. Considering weak probing of the magnon and driving of the skyrmion qubit, the second-order correlation function is analytically derived, and the optimal condition for realizing the magnon blockade is identified. Under the optimal condition, we systematically analyze the behavior of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under different parameter regimes. Our analysis shows that with appropriate driving and probing field intensities, the magnon blockade effect can be significantly enhanced, effectively suppressing multi-magnon states and facilitating the generation of high-purity single-magnon states exhibiting pronounced antibunching. Furthermore, we explore the physical mechanisms underlying the magnon blockade, revealing the coexistence and interplay of conventional and unconventional magnon blockade. This scheme provides a versatile all-magnetic platform for generating high purity single-magnon sources.</p>

            <p>In social networking services, users constantly change, and the network structure changes simultaneously. As the network structure changes, so does the word-of-mouth within it. To study how information transfer on the network changes with the aging of the network, we investigated the relation of the structure and the percolation in the aged networks. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barabási model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We introduced two tunable parameters, the deleting parameter $\alpha$ and the adding parameter $\beta$, and observed the aging behavior for the various parameter sets. We found that the network did not reach its steady state depending on the parameters. We also found that when the network is stable, there is a parameter region where the degree distribution changes from power-law to exponential decay. We performed the percolation analyses and found that the behavior of the percolation probability changes simultaneously with changes in the network's structure. This study is expected to help control network structure in steady-state aged networks.</p>

We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</p>

We found that these functions display a monotonically increasing dependence on the infection rate. Subsequently, a modification that mimics the mitigation in the probability of encountering an infected individual is introduced, following an old idea rooted in the Malthus-Verhulst model. We found that this modification drastically changes the probability that a connection meets an infected individual. However, despite this change, it does not alter the monotonically increasing behavior of the stationary prevalence.</p>

Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) has been highly successful in characterizing the topology and band structure of non-Hermitian systems. However, its applicability has been challenged in spatially inhomogeneous settings, where the non-locality of non-Hermitian pumping competes with Wannier-Stark localization and quantum interference, potentially leading to highly non-exponential state accumulation. To transcend this major conceptual bottleneck, we develop a general phase-space GBZ formalism that encodes non-Bloch deformations in both position and momentum space, such as to accurately represent spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian pumping. A key new phenomenon is the bifurcation of the phase-space GBZ branches, which allows certain eigenstates to jump abruptly between different GBZ solutions at various points in real space. The freedom in the locations of such jumps opens up an emergent degree of freedom that protects the stability of real spectra and, more impressively, the robustness of a new class of topological zero modes unique to GBZ this http URL response from these novel spectral and GBZ singularities can be readily demonstrated in mature metamaterial platforms such as photonic crystals or circuit arrays, where effective real-space hoppings can be engineered in a versatile this http URL framework directly generalizes to more complicated unit cells and further hoppings, opening up a vast new arena for exploring unconventional spectral and topological transitions as well as GBZ fragmentation in spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian settings.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effects of magnetic fields on excitonic condensation in the extended Falicov-Kimball model, which is a spinless two-orbital Hubbard model with orbital splitting. In lattice systems under magnetic fields up to several tens of teslas, Zeeman effects on electron spins have been extensively studied, while the impact on orbital motion has often been considered negligible. However, the recent capability to generate ultra-high magnetic fields exceeding 1000 T has renewed interest in understanding their influence on ordered phases in correlated electron systems, beyond spin-related phenomena. To examine these effects, we incorporate a magnetic field into the extended Falicov-Kimball model by introducing the Peierls phase into the transfer integrals, enabling the study of orbital motion. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we reveal a nonmonotonic response of the excitonic order parameter to increasing magnetic fields. At sufficiently high fields, the excitonic order is suppressed, resulting in a disordered insulating state characterized by partial occupation of the two orbitals with nonzero Chern numbers. This state is distinct from a fully orbital-polarized configuration. Furthermore, our analysis of an excitonic supersolid phase, in which excitonic and orbital orders coexist, demonstrates that orbital order remains robust under magnetic fields, while excitonic condensation is suppressed. These findings provide insights into the interplay between orbital motion and magnetic fields in multi-orbital correlated electron systems.</p>

In this work, we demonstrate monolayer TbCl as a promising candidate to realize the room temperature QAH effect. Based on density functional theory + HSE hybrid functional, we identify the topological properties with Hall conductivity $G = -e^2/h$ per layer in three-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator TbCl, which is weakly staked by the QAH layers. The monolayer TbCl inherits the magnetic and topological properties, and exhibits the QAH effect corresponding to the Chern number $C=-1$. The topological band gap is significantly large and reaches 42.8 meV, which is beyond room temperatue. Meanwhile, the magnetic study finds that the extended $5d$ electrons contribute to the magnetic momentum of Tb and lead to sizable exchange and superexchange interactions, resulting in a high Curie temperature $T_c \sim 457$K. All these features demonstrate that monolayer TbCl will provide an ideal platform to realize the room temperature QAH effect.</p>

Exploiting the particular multi-orbital character of the Fermi surface and the presence of Ising spin-orbit coupling which enable finite optical conductivity in the clean limit, in this work we predict clear-cut optical signatures of the chiral and nematic ground states of the $E'$ pairing. In particular, we show how the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and threefold symmetry are reflected in the optical Hall and anisotropic conductivities, respectively, while different spectral features can be connected with the momentum dependence of the gap functions. Our work provides a fingerprint that can be measured experimentally, constraining the pairing channel in TMD superconductors, and will help determine whether superconductivity is topological in these systems.</p>

            <h2>Linear and Nonlinear Edelstein Effects in Chiral Topological Semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haowei Xu, Ju Li</p>
            <p>Recently, there has been growing interest in achieving on-demand control of magnetism through electrical and optical means. In this work, we provide first-principles predictions for the linear and nonlinear Edelstein effects (LEE and NLEE) in the chiral topological semimetal CoSi. The LEE and NLEE represent first- and second-order magnetic responses to external electric fields, enabling precise manipulation of magnetization via electrical and optical methods. We demonstrate that although both LEE and NLEE require time-reversal symmetry breaking, they can still be realized in non-magnetic materials, as time-reversal symmetry can be spontaneously broken by heat and dissipation, according to the second law of thermodynamics. Meanwhile, due to different inversion symmetry selection rules, the LEE and NLEE manifest opposite and identical signs in the two enantiomers of CoSi, respectively. We further quantify the magnitude of LEE and NLEE, showing that electrically or optically induced magnetization can reach 10 Bohr magneton per unit cell when the external electric field strength is comparable with the internal atomic electric field, which is on the order of 1 V/A. Our work offers a systematical approach for predicting the electrical and optical control of magnetism in real materials, paving the way for potential applications in areas such as spintronics and magnetic memories.</p>

            <p>As branch-point singularities of non-Hermitian matrices, the exceptional points (EPs) exhibit unique spectral topology and criticality, with intriguing dynamic consequences in non-Hermitian settings. In open quantum systems, EPs also emerge in the Liouvillian spectrum, but their dynamic impact often pertains to the transient dynamics and is challenging to demonstrate. Here, using the flexible control afforded by single-photon interferometry, we study the chiral state transfer when the Liouvillian EP is parametrically encircled. Reconstructing the density-matrix evolution by experimentally simulating the quantum Langevin equation, we show that the chirality of the dynamics is only present within an intermediate encircling timescale and dictated by the landscape of the Liouvillian spectrum near the EP. However, the chirality disappears at long times as the system always relaxes to the steady state. We then demonstrate the universal scaling of the chirality with respect to the encircling time. Our experiment confirms the transient nature of chiral state transfer near a Liouvillian EP in open quantum systems, while our scheme paves the way for simulating general open-system dynamics using single photons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunling Zhou, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectrum in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various type of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.</p>

            <p>The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications. Here, we report a large intrinsic AHE with a resistivity of 114 n{\Omega} cm at 5 K in noncoplanar magnetic heterostructures of Cr5Te6/Pt. This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi level, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations. These findings open a new avenue for exploring the large AHE in heterointerfaces and facilitate the potential applications in topological spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Ran Qi</p>
            <p>We systematically studied the dynamics of Fermi polarons driven by time-dependent scattering length using a time-dependent variational method. Starting from the non-interacting initial state, we calculated the evolution behavior of the contact, energy, and quasiparticle residue of this system as the scattering length $a_s(t)$ increases from zero. In the short-time evolution, we obtained analytical results, verifying that when $a_s(t)$ grows as $\sqrt{t}$, the contact $C(t)$ and energy $E(t)$ exhibit the maximum growth rate. Furthermore, we numerically solved the long-time evolution, when $a_s(t)$ is diven with a strength $\beta$ and a power $\alpha$ as $a_s(t) = {\sqrt{2}\beta}/{k_F} {(\epsilon_Ft)}^{\alpha}$. For large driving strength, due to the interference between the polaron states and the non-interacting states, $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ exhibit oscillatory behavior; For small $\beta$, the oscillatory behavior disappears due to the decay of the repulsive polaron into the continuum, and $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ gradually relax to zero. The energy always saturates over long times for different driving strength. Additionally, our method is applicable to any time-dependent form of the scattering length.</p>

            <h2>Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shane P. Kelly, Jamir Marino</p>
            <p>In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the Rényi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010402 (2025) ] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.</p>

            <h2>Phase-space Generalized Brillouin Zone for spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingya Li, Hui Jiang, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) has been highly successful in characterizing the topology and band structure of non-Hermitian systems. However, its applicability has been challenged in spatially inhomogeneous settings, where the non-locality of non-Hermitian pumping competes with Wannier-Stark localization and quantum interference, potentially leading to highly non-exponential state accumulation. To transcend this major conceptual bottleneck, we develop a general phase-space GBZ formalism that encodes non-Bloch deformations in both position and momentum space, such as to accurately represent spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian pumping. A key new phenomenon is the bifurcation of the phase-space GBZ branches, which allows certain eigenstates to jump abruptly between different GBZ solutions at various points in real space. The freedom in the locations of such jumps opens up an emergent degree of freedom that protects the stability of real spectra and, more impressively, the robustness of a new class of topological zero modes unique to GBZ this http URL response from these novel spectral and GBZ singularities can be readily demonstrated in mature metamaterial platforms such as photonic crystals or circuit arrays, where effective real-space hoppings can be engineered in a versatile this http URL framework directly generalizes to more complicated unit cells and further hoppings, opening up a vast new arena for exploring unconventional spectral and topological transitions as well as GBZ fragmentation in spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian settings.</p>

            <p>A strongly dipolar $^{164}$Dy condensate of dipolar length $a_{\mathrm{dd}}=130.8a_0$, with $a_0$ the Bohr radius, hosts a wide variety of eigenstates, such as droplet, droplet-lattice, and ring-topology states, and self-bound droplets. Motivated by the observation of a very strongly dipolar condensate of NaCs molecules [Bigagli N et al. 2024 Nature 631 289], we demonstrate by numerical simulation, using an improved mean-field model, including the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, that in a very strongly dipolar NaCs condensate with $a_{\mathrm{dd}} = 2000a_0$, most of the above-mentioned states continue to exist and can appear for a much smaller number $N$ of particles ($N \lessapprox 1000$) within the present experimental possibility. However, in a single-component harmonically-trapped rotating NaCs condensate, a new type of coreless giant-vortex states, with a phase drop of $2 \pi L$ along a closed path around the axis of rotation, appear, where $L$ is the angular momentum of the vortex.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic-field effect on excitonic condensation emergent in extended Falicov-Kimball model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naoya Ohta, Joji Nasu</p>
            <p>We investigate the effects of magnetic fields on excitonic condensation in the extended Falicov-Kimball model, which is a spinless two-orbital Hubbard model with orbital splitting. In lattice systems under magnetic fields up to several tens of teslas, Zeeman effects on electron spins have been extensively studied, while the impact on orbital motion has often been considered negligible. However, the recent capability to generate ultra-high magnetic fields exceeding 1000 T has renewed interest in understanding their influence on ordered phases in correlated electron systems, beyond spin-related phenomena. To examine these effects, we incorporate a magnetic field into the extended Falicov-Kimball model by introducing the Peierls phase into the transfer integrals, enabling the study of orbital motion. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we reveal a nonmonotonic response of the excitonic order parameter to increasing magnetic fields. At sufficiently high fields, the excitonic order is suppressed, resulting in a disordered insulating state characterized by partial occupation of the two orbitals with nonzero Chern numbers. This state is distinct from a fully orbital-polarized configuration. Furthermore, our analysis of an excitonic supersolid phase, in which excitonic and orbital orders coexist, demonstrates that orbital order remains robust under magnetic fields, while excitonic condensation is suppressed. These findings provide insights into the interplay between orbital motion and magnetic fields in multi-orbital correlated electron systems.</p>

            <p>Following the successful experimental realization of the long-sought Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$, enhancing the work temperature of QAH effect has emerged as a significant and challenging task in condensed matter physics. In this work, we demonstrate monolayer TbCl as a promising candidate to realize the room temperature QAH effect. Based on density functional theory + HSE hybrid functional, we identify the topological properties with Hall conductivity $G = -e^2/h$ per layer in three-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator TbCl, which is weakly staked by the QAH layers. The monolayer TbCl inherits the magnetic and topological properties, and exhibits the QAH effect corresponding to the Chern number $C=-1$. The topological band gap is significantly large and reaches 42.8 meV, which is beyond room temperatue. Meanwhile, the magnetic study finds that the extended $5d$ electrons contribute to the magnetic momentum of Tb and lead to sizable exchange and superexchange interactions, resulting in a high Curie temperature $T_c \sim 457$K. All these features demonstrate that monolayer TbCl will provide an ideal platform to realize the room temperature QAH effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Glenn Wagner, Titus Neupert</p>
            <p>Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host bands with opposite Chern number for the two spin species and could thus be host for fractional topological insulator states. In multicomponent quantum Hall systems, where the spins have equal Chern number, the resulting topological liquid states can be well modeled by trial wavefunctions such as the Halperin $(lmn)$ wavefunctions. These wavefunctions are exact zero energy states of certain short-range (pseudopotential) Hamiltonians. However, we show that such a construction fails in the case where the Chern numbers of the two spins are opposite, since the electrons with opposite Chern number cannot avoid one another. This underlines the importance of suppressing the short-range interspin Coulomb repulsion in order to realize fractional topological insulators in twisted TMDs. We introduce a trial wavefunction for the opposite Chern number Landau levels for filling factor $\nu=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}$ in terms of pairing of composite fermions and show that it has good overlaps with the exact diagonalization ground state when the short-range Coulomb repulsion is sufficiently softened.</p>

            <p>Topologically trivial insulators are classified into two primary categories: unobstructed and obstructed atomic insulators. While both types can be described by exponentially localized Wannier orbitals, a defining feature of obstructed atomic insulators is that the centers of charge of these orbitals are positioned at empty sites within the unit cell, rather than on atoms. Despite extensive theoretical predictions, the unambiguous and quantitative experimental identification of an obstructed atomic phase has remained elusive. In this work, we present the first direct experimental evidence of such a phase in 1H-NbSe$_2$. We develop a novel method to extract the inter-orbital correlation functions from the local spectral function probed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), leveraging the orbital wave functions obtained from ab initio calculations. Applying this technique to STM images, we determine the inter-orbital correlation functions for the atomic band of 1H-NbSe$_2$ that crosses the Fermi level. Our results show that this band realizes an optimally compact obstructed atomic phase, providing the first unambiguous experimental identification of such a phase. Our approach of deconvolving the STM signal using ab initio orbital wave functions is broadly applicable to other material platforms, offering a powerful tool for exploring other electronic phases.</p>

            <p>We propose an efficient analytical representation of the frequency-dependent $GW$ self-energy $\Sigma$ via a multipole approximation (MPA-$\Sigma$). The multipole-Padé model for the self-energy is interpolated from a small set of numerical evaluations of $\Sigma$ in the complex frequency plane, similarly to the previously multipole representation developed for the screened Coulomb interaction (MPA-$W$) [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 115157 (2021)]. We show that, likewise MPA-$W$, an appropriate choice of frequency sampling in MPA-$\Sigma$ is critical to guarantee computational efficiency and high accuracy. The combined MPA-$W$ and MPA-$\Sigma$ scheme considerably reduces the cost of full-frequency self-energy calculations, especially for spectral band structures over a wide energy range. Crucially, MPA-$\Sigma$ enables a multipole representation for the interacting Green's function $G$ (MPA-$G$), providing a straightforward evaluation of all the spectral properties, and a more general way to define the renormalization factor $Z$. We validate the MPA-$\Sigma$ and MPA-$G$ approaches for diverse systems: bulk Si, Na and Cu, monolayer MoS$_2$, the NaCl ion-pair and the F$_2$ molecule. Moreover, we introduce toy MPA-$\Sigma$/$G$ models to examine the quasiparticle picture in different regimens of weak and strong correlation. With these models, we expose limitations in defining $Z$ from the local derivative of $\Sigma$.</p>

We examined the impact of omitted vertex corrections using the more computationally intensive quasiparticle self-consistent QPGW and partially self-consistent QPGW$_0$ methodologies. We observed consistent trends across Cr-based and other 2D materials compared by advanced GW calculations, suggesting that single-shot G$_0$W$_0$@PBE can provide reasonable estimates of fundamental gaps when applied with caution. While this approach shows promise for a variety of 2D materials, including complicated antiferromagnetic chromium-based transition metal carbides (MXenes), further research is required to validate its reliability for strongly correlated systems. In contrast, the G$_0$W$_0$@HSE06 approach may strongly overestimate gaps in some cases.</p>

            <p>This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics--though unavailable to them--thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Dispersive dark excitons in van der Waals ferromagnet CrI3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. He, J. Sears, F. Barantani, T. Kim, J. W. Villanova, T. Berlijn, M. Lajer, M. A. McGuire, J. Pelliciari, V. Bisogni, S. Johnston, E. Baldini, M. Mitrano, M. P. M. Dean</p>
            <p>Spin-flip dark excitons are optical-dipole-forbidden quasiparticles with remarkable potential in optoelectronics, especially when they are realized within cleavable van der Waals materials. Despite this potential, dark excitons have not yet been definitively identified in ferromagnetic van der Waals materials. Here, we report two dark excitons in a model ferromagnetic material CrI3 using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and show that they feature narrower linewidths compared to the bright excitons previously reported in this material. These excitons are shown to have spin-flip character, to disperse as a function of momentum, and to change through the ferromagnetic transition temperature. Given the versatility of van der Waals materials, these excitons hold promise for new types of magneto-optical functionality.</p>
