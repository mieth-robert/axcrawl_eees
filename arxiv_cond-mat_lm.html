            <h2>Characterizing Topological Phase Transition in Non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> ZhaoXiang Fang, Yongxu Fu, Guang-Can Guo, Long Xiong</p>
            <p>We propose and present a concept of Topological Distance (TD), obtained from the integration of trace distance over the generalized Brillouin zone, in order to characterize the topological transitions of non-Hermitian systems. Specifically, such a quantity is used to measure the overall dissimilarity between eigen wavefunctions upon traversing all possible matter states, and confirms the phase boundaries through observing the divergences of both TD and its partial derivatives; we clarify its origin and also offer a theoretical explanation. The method is developed to characterize the non-Hermitian topology in a novel way, and shows its generality and effectiveness in 1D non-Hermitian Kitaev systems, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians under periodic or open boundary conditions, and even generalizable to higher-order topological systems, providing a novel perspective to understand topological physics.</p>

            <h2>Spin ladder quantum simulators from spin-orbit-coupled quantum dot spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of distinct relaxation behaviour and Quantum Regression Theorem in the Ultra-strong Coupling Limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sakil Khan, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla</p>
            <p>In the framework of open quantum systems, we derive the dynamical equation governing two-time correlation functions in the ultra-strong coupling (USC) regime between the system and its environment. Unlike the case of the standard weak-coupling regime, in the USC case, we find distinct relaxation behavior for two-time correlators depending on the types of the operators involved in the correlation function. Interestingly, the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT) emerges after the fastest relaxation time-scale, which is governed by the system-bath coupling strength. We exemplify our findings for the dissipative spin-boson model and further find excellent agreement with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method.</p>

            <h2>Spin-orbit-enabled realization of arbitrary two-qubit gates on moving spins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Fernández-Fernández, Y. Matsumoto, L.M.K. Vandersypen, G. Platero, S. Bosco</p>
            <p>Shuttling spin qubits in systems with large spin-orbit interaction (SOI) can cause errors during motion. However, in this work, we demonstrate that SOI can be harnessed to implement an arbitrary high-fidelity two-qubit (2Q) gate. We consider two spin qubits defined in a semiconductor double quantum dot that are smoothly moved toward each other by gate voltages. We show that an arbitrary high-fidelity 2Q gate can be realized by controlling the shuttling speed and waiting times, and leveraging strong intrinsic or extrinsic SOI. Crucially, performing 2Q operations during qubit transport enables a one-step realization of a wide range of 2Q gates, which often involve several steps when implemented using static dots. Our findings establish a practical route toward direct implementation of any 2Q gate via spin shuttling, significantly reducing control overhead in scalable quantum computing architectures.</p>

            <h2>Emergent gauge flux in QED$_3$ with flavor chemical potential: application to magnetized U(1) Dirac spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Chen, Urban F. P. Seifert, Kexin Feng, Oleg A. Starykh, Leon Balents, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>We design a lattice model of non-compact U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions with a flavor chemical potential and solve it with large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. For zero flavor chemical potential, the model realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) which has been argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we find a ''chiral flux'' phase which is characterized by the generation of a finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)$_m$ magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which, due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions. Further, sufficiently strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Emergent dynamical Kondo coherence and competing magnetic order in a correlated kagome flat-band metal CsCr6Sb6</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangqi Liu, Xuefeng Zhang, Jiachen Jiao, Renjie Zhang, Kaiwen Chen, Ying Wang, Yunguan Ye, Zhenhai Yu, Chengyu Jiang, Xia Wang, Lei Shu, Baiqing Lv, Gang Li, Yanfeng Guo</p>
            <p>Correlated kagome metals host unique electronic states that enable exotic quantum phenomena. In the recently emerged CsCr6Sb6, these manifest through Kondo behavior from localized Cr-3d electrons and unprecedented band flattening near the Fermi level. Yet the intricate interplay among Kondo screening, magnetic frustration, and electronic correlations remains poorly understood-a fundamental gap we address through multifaceted experimental and theoretical approaches. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal electronic correlation-renormalized flat bands and muon spin relaxation study detect short-range magnetic order at TN ~ 80 K. Complementing these findings, density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations identify a coherent-incoherent crossover at TN, with a remarkable restoration of coherence accompanying local moment suppression-an anomalous hallmark of Kondo behavior. Intriguingly, despite strong interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling, the system evades long-range magnetic order due to competing magnetic configurations separated by sub-meV energy differences. These insights establish CsCr6Sb6 as a prototypical platform for investigating dynamical Kondo screening in correlated flat-band systems, opening new avenues to study flat band physics and frustrated magnetism in correlated kagome lattices.</p>

            <h2>Lifshitz transition in correlated topological semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byungkyun Kang, Myoung-Hwan Kim, Chul Hong Park, Anderson Janotti, Eunja Kim</p>
            <p>Topological quasiparticles, arising when the chemical potential is near the band crossing, are pivotal for the development of next-generation quantum devices. They are expected to exist in half-Heusler correlated topological semimetals. However, the emergence of hole carriers, which alter the chemical potential away from the quadratic-band-touching points is not yet understood. Here, we investigated the electronic structure of YPtBi and GdPtBi through ab initio many-body perturbation GW theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory and revealed that the correlation effects of 4$d$ or 4$f$ electrons can lead to the formation of hole carriers. In YPtBi, the weakly correlated Y-4$d$ electrons constitute the topological bands, and the quadratic-band-touching point is at the Fermi level at high temperatures. At low temperatures, enhanced correlations of Y-4$d$ renormalize the topological bands, leading to the formation of hole pocket. In GdPtBi, the strongly correlated Gd-4$f$ electrons form the Hubbard-like bands originate from self-energy effects associated with a topological singularity. These local bands encompass itinerant 4$f$ bands, which hybridize with topological bands to induce pronounced hole bands. This concerted effect reduces the hole doping, bringing the chemical potential closer to the quadratic-band-touching points as the temperature is lowered. The temperature-induced Lifshitz transition should be responsible for the large hole bands observed in both topological semimetals in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements at low temperatures. Our findings indicate that the integration of correlated fermions within a topological framework can modulate the energy landscape of topological bands.</p>

            <h2>Giant Magnetocaloric Effect in a Honeycomb Spiral Spin-Liquid Candidate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqian Zhao, Xun Chen, Zongtang Wan, Zhaohua Ma, Yuesheng Li</p>
            <p>Unlike conventional magnetic states, which lack degeneracy, the spiral spin liquid (SSL) fluctuates among degenerate spiral configurations, with ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space. At low temperatures, the field-induced crossover from the polarized ferromagnetic state to the SSL results in a large entropy increase and decalescence, indicating its potential for magnetic cooling. However, magnetic cooling using a SSL has yet to be reported. Here, we investigate the magnetocaloric effect and cooling performance of single-crystal GdZnPO, a spin-7/2 honeycomb-lattice SSL candidate, under a magnetic field $H$ $<$ $H_\mathrm{c}$ ($\mu_0H_\mathrm{c}$ $\sim$ 12 T) applied perpendicular to the honeycomb plane and below the crossover temperature ($\sim$2 K). For $H$ $\geq$ $H_\mathrm{c}$, GdZnPO enters a polarized non-degenerate ferromagnetic state. Our results demonstrate that GdZnPO exhibits a giant low-temperature magnetocaloric effect near $H_\mathrm{c}$, surpassing other magnetocaloric materials. This giant magnetocaloric effect is well-explained by the frustrated honeycomb spin model of GdZnPO, suggesting the stability of the SSL below $H_\mathrm{c}$ down to very low temperatures. Additionally, its magnetic cooling performance remains robust up to at least 4.5 K, making GdZnPO a promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration down to $\sim$36 mK through cycling the applied magnetic field within a narrow range.</p>

            <h2>Ferroelectric Control of Interlayer Excitons in 3R-MoS$_{2}$ / MoSe$_{2}$ Heterostructures</h2>

            <p>Van der Waals heterostructures, constructed by stacking two-dimensional materials, have enabled the study of interlayer coupling between different materials. One example is the formation of interlayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. The integration of 2D sliding ferroelectric materials introduces new opportunities for manipulating excitonic properties in these systems. In this work, we investigate the interaction between interlayer excitons and ferroelectric domains in hBN-encapsulated 3R-MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterostructures, combining photoluminescence experiments with density functional theory and many-body calculations. Photoluminescence spectroscopy at low temperature reveals a strong redshift of the interlayer exciton energy with increasing MoS$_2$ layer thickness, attributed to band renormalization and dielectric environment changes. Additionally, local variations in photoluminescence energy correlate with local ferroelectric domain polarization, showcasing distinct domain-dependent interlayer exciton behavior. Gate voltage experiments further demonstrate tunable shifts in interlayer exciton energy, driven by switching ferroelectric domains. These results highlight the potential of interlayer excitons being controlled by local ferroelectric polarization and establish a foundation for future ferroelectric optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Electrostatic gate-controlled quantum interference in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas at the (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Km Rubi, Kun Han, Huang Zhen, Michel Goiran, Duncan K. Maude, Walter Escoffier, A. Ariando</p>
            <p>We report quantum oscillations in magnetoresistance that are periodic in magnetic field ($B$), observed at the interface between (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$. Unlike Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, which appear at magnetic fields $ > 7$ T and diminish quickly as the temperature rises, these $B$-periodic oscillations emerge at low fields and persist up to 10 K. Their amplitude decays exponentially with both temperature and field, specifying dephasing of quantum interference. Increasing the carrier density through electrostatic gating results in a systematic reduction in both the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations, with complete suppression beyond a certain gate voltage. We attribute these oscillations to the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect, likely arising from naturally formed closed-loop paths due to the interconnected quasi-one-dimensional conduction channels along SrTiO$_3$ domain walls. The relatively long phase coherence length ($\sim$ 1.8 $\mu$m at 0.1 K), estimated from the oscillation amplitude, highlights the potential of complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for exploring quantum interference effects and advancing device concepts in quantum technologies, such as mesoscopic interferometers and quantum sensors.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling orbital optical chirality through multipolar chiral light-matter interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shun Hashiyada, An'an Wu, Yoshito Y. Tanaka</p>
            <p>Chiral light-matter interactions have traditionally been understood in terms of electric-magnetic dipolar interference driven by light with spin angular momentum. Here, we show that optical chirality can also originate from the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, giving rise to higher-order multipolar chiral responses. Using a twisted gold nanorod dimer and tightly focused circularly polarized optical vortex beams carrying spin and orbital angular momenta of the same sign, we measure spectrally and spatially resolved chiral dichroism signals that persist even where spin optical chirality vanishes, revealing a quadrupole-mediated chiral interaction driven by OAM. The spectra reveal clear quadrupole resonances whose spectral profile is strongly modulated by the OAM sign, demonstrating an OAM-driven chiral interaction. Crucially, the signal satisfies optical reciprocity, ruling out artefacts from anisotropy or misalignment and confirming its nature as a true chiral response. Angular momentum dissipation analysis further shows that orbital contributions dominate over spin. These findings establish the existence of a distinct form of optical chirality, referred to as orbital optical chirality, which opens new avenues for probing and controlling multipolar chiral light-matter interactions beyond the dipolar paradigm.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropic exciton-polaritons reveal non-Hermitian topology in van der Waals materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devarshi Chakrabarty, Avijit Dhara, Pritam Das, Kritika Ghosh, Ayan Roy Chaudhuri, Sajal Dhara</p>
            <p>Topological band theory has expanded into various domains in applied physics, offering significant potential for future technologies. Recent developments indicate that unique bulk band topology perceived for electrons can be realized in a system of light-matter quasiparticles with reduced crystal symmetry utilizing tunable light-matter interaction. In this work we realize topologically non-trivial energy band dispersion of exciton-polaritons confined in two-dimensional anisotropic materials inside an optical microcavity, and show the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) due to non-Hermitian topology arising from excitonic dipole oscillators with finite quasiparticle lifetime. Fourier-plane imaging reveals two pairs of EPs connected by bulk Fermi arcs for each of the transverse electric and magnetic polarized modes. An anisotropic Lorentz oscillator model captures the exact band dispersion observed in our experiment in two-dimensional momentum space. Our findings establish anisotropic two-dimensional materials as a platform for exploring non-Hermitian topological physics, with implications for polarization-controlled optical technologies.</p>

            <h2>Above room temperature multiferroic tunnel junction with the altermagnetic metal CrSb</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long Zhang, Guangxin Ni, Junjie He, Guoying Gao</p>
            <p>Altermagnets with nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, nonferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308%, TER of 707%, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. The transport performance is robust under bias voltage. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic sensing, and quantum logic nanodevices.</p>

            <p>Diamond optomechanical crystal (OMC) devices with embedded color center spins are promising platforms for a broad range of applications in quantum sensing, networking, and computing applications, offering an interface between a GHz-frequency mechanical mode and both optical photons and coherent spins. A crucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a device with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the bulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\mu$s for embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\gg1$) at cryogenic temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are enabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond membranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond overgrowth with nitrogen $\delta$-doping. We discuss the prospects of this platform for hybrid spin-mechanical devices in the quantum regime.</p>

            <h2>Gapless fracton quantum spin liquid and emergent photons in a 2D spin-1 model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nils Niggemann, Meghadeepa Adhikary, Yannik Schaden-Thillmann, Johannes Reuther</p>
            <p>Gapless fracton quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter described by higher-rank U(1) gauge theories which host gapped and immobile fracton matter excitations as well as gapless photons. Despite well-known field theories, no spin models beyond purely classical systems have been identified to realize these phases. Using error-controlled Green function Monte Carlo, here we investigate a square lattice spin-1 model that shows precise signatures of a fracton quantum spin liquid without indications of conventional ordering. Specifically, the magnetic response exhibits characteristic patterns of suppressed pinch points that accurately match the prediction of a rank-2 U(1) field theory and reveals the existence of emergent photon excitations in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Remarkably, this type of fracton quantum spin liquid is not only identified in the system's ground state but also in generic low-energy sectors of a strongly fragmented Hilbert space.</p>

            <p>Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories remains a fundamental challenge in high-energy physics. Indeed, most large scale experiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium dynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general extremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing potential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed different characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking and false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we observe real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we demonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string fragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering processes with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes. Utilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon quenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an extensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order correlations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly correlated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions between heavy ions. Our work establishes a high-resolution approach for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics, opening alternative pathways toward studying far-from-equilibrium phenomena in high-energy physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long Ma, Dai-Nam Le, Lilia M. Woods</p>
            <p>Radiative heat transfer is of great interest from a fundamental point of view and for energy harvesting applications. This is a material dependent phenomenon where confined plasmonic excitations, hyperbolicity and other properties can be effective channels for enhancement, especially at the near field regime. Materials with reduced dimensions may offer further benefits of enhancement compared to the bulk systems. Here we study the radiative thermal power in the family of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in their H- and T-symmetries. For this purpose, the computed from first principles electronic and optical properties are then used in effective models to understand the emerging scaling laws for metals and semiconductors as well as specific materials signatures as control knobs for radiative heat transfer. Our combined approach of analytical modeling with properties from ab initio simulations can be used for other materials families to build a materials database for radiative heat transfer.</p>

            <p>Due to the structure of the underlying SO(3) $\mathbf d$-vector order parameter, spin triplet superconductors exhibit a bulk-edge correspondence linking the circulation of supercurrent to the bulk magnetic skyrmion density, giving rise to topological hydrodynamics of magnetic skyrmions. To probe the interplay of charge and spin dynamics, we propose a blueprint for a spin-triplet superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which functions without a Josephson weak link. The triplet SQUID undergoes nonsingular $4\pi$ phase slips, in which current relaxation is facilitated by spin dynamics that trace out a magnetic skyrmion texture. Inductively coupling the device to a tank circuit and probing the nonlinear supercurrent response via Oersted field measurements could provide an experimental signature of ferromagnetic spin-triplet superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialin Chen, Chuanshu Xu, Qiaoyi Li, Wei Li</p>
            <p>The recently discovered trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has emerged as a promising platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity. However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas Sicheler, Roberto Raimondi, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Lorenzo Del Re</p>
            <p>Altermagnets are a novel class of materials that combine antiferromagnetic spin ordering with non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) in their band structure, making them promising candidates for spintronics applications without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional bilayer Mott insulator that exhibits altermagnetic order. The interplay between spin and layer degrees of freedom gives rise to a complex symmetry-breaking pattern involving both magnetic and interlayer-coherent components. A key control parameter in the system is the layer polarization, which can be tuned via an external gate voltage. We show that applying an in-plane electric field with opposite signs in the two layers induces a polarization current that drives a spin current in each layer. While the polarization current is isotropic, the resulting spin current exhibits strong anisotropy and can be reversed by adjusting the photon energy. These findings suggest new avenues for manipulating spin transport in altermagnetic systems via electric and optical means.</p>

            <h2>Coulombic control of charge transfer in luminescent radicals with long-lived quartet states</h2>

            <p>Excitons in organic materials are emerging as an attractive platform for tunable quantum technologies. Structures with near-degenerate doublet and triplet excitations in linked trityl radical, acene and carbazole units can host quartet states. These high spin states can be coherently manipulated, and later decay radiatively via the radical doublet transition. However, this requires controlling the deexcitation pathways of all metastable states. Here we establish design rules for efficient quartet generation in luminescent radicals, using different connection arrangements of the molecular units. We discover that electronic coupling strength between these units dictates luminescence and quartet formation yields, particularly through the energetics of an acene-radical charge transfer state, which we tune Coulombically. This state acts as a source of non-radiative decay when acene-radical separation is small, but facilitates doublet-quartet spin interconversion when acene-radical separation is large. Using these rules we report a radical-carbazole-acene material with 55% luminescence yield, where 94% of emitting excitons originate from the quartet at microsecond times. This reveals the central role of molecular topology in luminescent quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youngjae Kim</p>
            <p>The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</p>

            <p>Understanding the nature of collective charge dynamics in the Coulomb gap phase is essential for revealing the existence of many-body localization. However, the corresponding many-particle excitation spectra remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of $^{27}$Al and $^{63}$Cu nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance (NMR/NQR), along with specific heat ($C_p$) measurements, in the $p$-type semiconductor CuAlO$_2$. Our study unveils distinct changes in charge dynamics at two crossover temperature scales which separate three regimes associated with Anderson localization of charge carriers: thermally activated transport ($T>150$ K) $\rightarrow$ Mott variable-range hopping (VRH) $\rightarrow$ Efros-Shklovskii (ES) VRH with Coulomb gap formation ($T<50$ K). In the ES VRH regime, we observe a striking divergence in the zero-field $^{63}$Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate, $(T_1T)^{-1}$, which is strongly suppressed by an applied magnetic field, indicative of quantum critical charge fluctuations. This is further supported by a distinct magnetic field-dependence of $C_p/T$ deep within the Coulomb gap phase. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for the emergence of strong, gapless collective charge fluctuations within the Anderson insulating phase where single-particle excitations are gapped.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taegeun Song, Nojoon Myoung</p>
            <p>Graphene provides an excellent platform for investigating electron quantum interference due to its outstanding coherent properties. In the quantum Hall regime, Mach--Zehnder (MZ) electronic interferometers are realized using p--n junctions in graphene, where electron interference is highly protected against decoherence. In this work, we present a phenomenological framework for graphene-based MZ interferometry with asymmetric p--n junction configurations. We show that the enclosed interferometer area can be tuned by asymmetric gate potentials, and additional MZ pathways emerge in higher-filling-factor scenarios, e.g. $\left(\nu_{n},\nu_{p}\right)=\left(-3,+3\right)$. The resulting complicated beat oscillations in asymmetric-gate MZ interference are efficiently analyzed using a machine-learning--based Fourier transform, which yields improved peak-to-background ratios compared to conventional signal-processing techniques. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the asymmetric gate on the interference visibility, finding that interference visibility is enhanced under symmetric gate conditions.</p>

            <h2>Supercritical fluids as a distinct state of matter characterized by sub-short-range structural order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sha Jin, Xinyang Li, Xue Fan, Matteo Baggioli, Yuliang Jin</p>
            <p>A supercritical fluid (SCF)--the state of matter at temperatures and pressures above the critical point--exhibits properties intermediate between those of a liquid and a gas. However, whether it constitutes a fundamentally distinct phase or merely a continuous extension of the liquid and gas states remains an open question. Here we show that a SCF is defined by sub-short-range (SSR) structural order in the spatial arrangement of particles, setting it apart from the gas (disordered), liquid (short-range ordered), and solid (long-range ordered) states. The SSR structural order can be characterized by a length scale effectively quantified by the number of observable peaks in the radial distribution function. This length grows from a minimum microscopic value, on the order of the inter-particle distance at the gas-SCF boundary, to a diverging value at the SCF-liquid boundary. Based on the emergence of SSR order, we demonstrate that the transport and dynamical properties of the SCF state, including the diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity, and velocity autocorrelation function, also clearly distinguish it from both the liquid and gas states. Theoretical predictions are validated by molecular dynamics simulations of argon and further supported by existing experimental evidence. Our study confirms and assigns physical significance to the refined phase diagram of matter in the supercritical region, consisting of three distinct states (gas, supercritical fluid, and liquid) separated by two crossover boundaries that follow universal scaling laws.</p>

However, in the strict sense, the statements are not mutually equivalent. Once the tacit assumption is released, the inequivalence must remain, and we may have some systems that are only compatible with one or two statements but not all, defining a singular zero-temperature system which can never be excluded from physical feasibility. We revisit some previously proposed theoretical models and identify that they belong to the singular system.</p>

            <h2>A Spin Glass Characterization of Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Li</p>
            <p>This work presents a statistical mechanics characterization of neural networks, motivated by the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) phenomenon in spin glasses. A Hopfield-type spin glass model is constructed from a given feedforward neural network (FNN). Overlaps between simulated replica samples serve as a characteristic descriptor of the FNN. The connection between the spin-glass description and commonly studied properties of the FNN -- such as data fitting, capacity, generalization, and robustness -- has been investigated and empirically demonstrated. Unlike prior analytical studies that focus on model ensembles, this method provides a computable descriptor for individual network instances, which reveals nontrivial structural properties that are not captured by conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy. Preliminary results suggests its potential for practical applications such as model inspection, safety verification, and detection of hidden vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>The Raman scattering response of the biaxial antiferromagnet CoPS$_3$ has been investigated as a function of both magnetic field and temperature. The peaks observed in the low-frequency spectral range (90--200~cm$^{-1}$) have been identified as hybrid magnon--phonon excitations. The energies of the bare magnon and phonon modes, as well as the effective coupling strengths between different excitation pairs, have been determined. The strong and selective magnon--phonon interaction largely accounts for the pronounced splitting of two phonon-like modes observed at 152~cm$^{-1}$ and 158~cm$^{-1}$ in the antiferromagnetic phase of CoPS$_3$. Based on the identification of bare magnon excitations and their magnetic-field dependence, we propose an updated set of parameters for the effective exchange ($J_{\mathrm{eff}} = 9.9$~meV) and biaxial magnetic anisotropy ($D = 4.3$~meV and $E = -0.7$~meV) and advocate for an apparent anisotropic $g$-factor ($g_x = g_y = 2$, $g_z = 4$) in the CoPS$_3$ antiferromagnet.</p>

            <p>The LnSbTe family is well known for hosting a plethora of intriguing characteristics stemming from its crystalline symmetry, magnetic structure, 4f electronic correlations and spin orbit coupling (SOC) phenomena. In this paper, we have systematically studied the bulk electrical and thermodynamic properties and electronic structure of the nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) corroborated with first principles based theoretical band structure calculations with and without considering the effect of SOC, a critical factor dictating the band degeneracy which depends on the choice of the Ln atom. Corroborative temperature dependent susceptibility, electrical resistivity and thermodynamic measurements, coherently exhibit paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition approximately at 1.94 K, and another sharp anomaly at 1.75 K. The zero field cooled resistivity measurement does not show the characteristic hump like feature in the other LnSbTe materials. The electronic band structure of ErSbTe, exhibits a diamond shaped Fermi surface. Along the high symmetry direction GX, electronic bands are projected to cross over the Fermi energy, necessitated by the nonsymmorphic symmetry of the system. The other crossing along this direction is gapped, which evolves along the momentum space reaching its maximum along the GM direction.</p>

            <h2>Effective toughness estimation by FFT based phase field fracture: application to composites and polycrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro Aranda, Javier Segurado</p>
            <p>An estimate of the effective toughness of heterogeneous materials is proposed based on the Phase Field Fracture model implemented in an FFT homogenization solver. The estimate is based on the simulation of the deformation of representative volume elements of the microstructure, controlled by a constant energy dissipation rate using an arc-length type control. The definition of the toughness corresponds to the total energy dissipated after the total fracture of the RVE -- which can be accurately obtained thanks to the dissipation control -- divided by the RVE transverse area (length in 2D). The proposed estimate accounts for both the effect of heterogeneity in toughness and elastic response on the overall fracture energy and allows as well to account for phases with anisotropic elastic and fracture response (fracture by cleavage). To improve toughness predictions, crack-tip enrichment is used to model initial cracks. The method is applied to obtain the effective toughness of composites and elastic polycrystals in a series of examples. In the two types of materials, it is found that both heterogeneity in elastic response and fracture energy contribute to increase the effective toughness. Microscopically, it is found that toughening mechanisms are related to the passage of the crack through tougher phases and deviation of the crack path. It is also found that the latter is the controlling mechanism for cases with marked heterogeneity and high anisotropy, eventually provoking toughening saturation for sufficiently high values of heterogeneity or anisotropy.</p>

            <h2>Correlated electrons in flat bands: Concepts and Developments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhuparna Karmakar</p>
            <p>When the electronic dispersion in a material is independent of momentum, it gives rise to strongly correlated flat bands, with the single particle energy, quenched. Though the notion of flat bands had been known since long, their experimental realization is achieved much later with the advent of ultra cold atomic gases, followed by photonic lattices, coordination polymers and more recently solid state materials. By the virtue of their quenched kinetic energy scales the flat band materials provide an ideal platform to engineer, customize and investigate the interplay between topology, geometry and strong electronic correlations; giving rise to exotic quantum phases such as, unconventional superconductivity, Mott insulator, non Fermi liquid metals etc. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation and material realization of the many body systems with flat electronic bands. We discuss the origin of the flat bands and their mathematical construction in prototypical lattices, particularly focussing on those with Lieb and Kagome geometries. Observations made and inferences drawn based on the recent experimental and theoretical investigations are presented along with the framework for a non perturbative numerical approach to address the quantum phases in the flat band materials. By synthesizing insights from both theory and experiment, this review aims to provide a unifying perspective on the emergent many-body phenomena in flat band systems and to outline future directions for the field.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present a Pt decorated ZnO thin film-based gas sensor for hydrogen detection, fabricated using a sputtering technique and an in-situ Pt decoration approach. Specifically, we deposit a ZnO thin film on an interdigitated electrode substrate, with Pt nanoclusters added to the (002) polar plane by brief sputtering (1 to 6 s) to create an active sensing interface. Our sensor demonstrates optimal performance at an operating temperature of 498 K, with rapid response and recovery times (10 and 3 s), high selectivity, and long-term stability. We find the Pt decorated ZnO sensor, with a Pt deposition time of 2 s, to exhibit enhanced response (~52,987%) to 1% hydrogen concentration, indicating its suitability for industrial and environmental monitoring applications. Additionally, our device demonstrates reliable detection of low hydrogen concentrations (~100 ppb), with a response of ~38% and no response drift over one year of testing, underscoring the long-term stability of the sensor. To elucidate the role of Pt deposition and pristine ZnO in hydrogen sensing, we perform density functional theory calculations, analysing adsorption and reaction energetics involving H2, O2, O, OH, and H2O, and lattice oxygen atoms on the ZnO (002) surface with and without Pt decoration. Our computational data is in agreement with our experiments, identifying the oxygen-exposed (002) surface to be most active for hydrogen sensing in both pristine and Pt decorated ZnO. Further, our computations highlight the role of Pt in enhancing hydrogen sensitivity via i) activating an autoreduction pathway of adsorbed OH, ii) spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed molecular H2, and iii) keeping the lattice oxygen pathway of forming H2O active. Our systematic approach of designing sensors combining an experimental setup with theoretical insights, is key in developing and optimizing efficient hydrogen gas sensors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline Mauron, Karen V. Kheruntsyan, Giulia De Rosi</p>
            <p>Using the theory of generalized hydrodynamics, we study the dipole compression collective oscillations of a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas in the crossover from weak to strong repulsive interactions. In the uniform limit, the system is described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model, while the presence of the trap breaks integrability. In contrast to previous predictions based on the classical hydrodynamic variational ansatz -- which yields a single-frequency dipole compression mode -- we observe a beating signal comprising two frequencies across all regimes of the gas. Furthermore, we find that the higher frequency crosses over from the low-temperature phononic hydrodynamic regime to the collisionless limit as the temperature increases -- without saturating at the previously predicted value characteristic of the high-temperature collisional hydrodynamic regime. This crossover occurs around the so-called hole-induced anomaly temperature, above which the quasiparticle picture of excitations no longer applies. This explains the absence of the collisional hydrodynamic regime and resolves a long-standing open question about its validity at high temperatures in systems where integrability is nearly broken by weak confinement. Our findings reveal intricate connections between excitations, thermodynamics, correlations, dynamics, and interparticle collisions, and may prove relevant to other atomic, nuclear, solid-state, electronic, and spin systems that exhibit similar anomalies or thermal second-order phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Khalifa, Brian A. Shoemaker, Amir Haji-Akbari</p>
            <p>Ion transport through nanoscale channels and pores is pivotal to numerous natural processes and industrial applications. Experimental investigation of the kinetics and mechanisms of such processes is, however, hampered by the limited spatiotemporal resolution of existing experimental techniques. While molecular simulations have become indispensable for unraveling the underlying principles of nanoscale transport, they also suffer from some important technical limitations. In our previous works, we identified strong polarization-induced finite-size effects in molecular dynamics simulations of hindered ion transport, caused by spurious long-range interactions between the traversing ion and the periodic replicates of other ions. To rectify these artifacts, we introduced the Ideal Conductor/Dielectric Model (\textsc{Icdm}), which treats the system as a combination of conductors and dielectrics, and constructs an analytical correction to the translocation free energy profile. Here, we investigate some limitations of this model. Firstly, we propose a generalized approach based on Markov State models that is capable of estimating translocation timescales in the thermodynamic limit for free energy profiles with multiple comparable barriers. Second, we identify a new category of polarization-induced finite-size effects, which significantly alter the spatial distribution of non-traversing ions in smaller systems. These secondary effects cannot be corrected by the ICDM model and must be avoided by selecting sufficiently large system sizes. Additionally, we demonstrate through multiple case studies that finite-size artifacts can reverse expected trends in ion transport kinetics. Our findings underscore the necessity for careful selection of system sizes and the judicious application of the \textsc{Icdm} model to rectify residual finite-size artifacts.</p>

            <p>We study the effect of symmetry-breaking perturbations in the multiorbital Hubbard model coupled to anisotropic Jahn-Teller phonons, which is relevant for the description of fulleride superconductors. This system is often approximated by a model with static antiferromagnetic (AFM) Hund's coupling, in which the coupling to the Jahn-Teller phonon is effectively described, but the retardation effect associated with phonon propagation is neglected. We compare the properties of the models with static AFM Hund's coupling and dynamical Jahn-Teller electron-phonon interaction by means of the Eliashberg theory. Considering the susceptibilities for the spin, magnetic orbital, electric orbital, and superconductivity, we reveal a qualitatively different behavior between the two models in the case of the magnetic orbital susceptibility. We further study the effect of a magnetic field on the $s$-wave spin-singlet superconducting state. In the presence of the field, the magnetic orbital susceptibility becomes nonzero due to a combination of multiorbital and retardation effects, while the spin susceptibility remains zero at low temperatures. By analyzing this phenomenon both numerically and analytically, we clarify that odd-frequency pairs induced by the magnetic field play a crucial role in the spin and orbital magnetic susceptibilities. Thus, the magnetic degrees of freedom produce interesting behaviors in the presence of retardation effects associated with electron-phonon coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Pollack, Rohan Maniar, John P. Perdew</p>
            <p>Density functional theory (DFT) is a widespread and effective tool in electronic structure calculations for ground-state electron systems. Its success has prompted exploration into the use of DFT for non-collective excited states. The delta self-consistent field ($\Delta$SCF) method allows for the extension of DFT to excited-state energies by restricting the Kohn-Sham orbital occupations, producing an excited-state electron density, and then computing its energy. In this paper, we examine the performance of the LSDA, PBE generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), and SCAN/r2SCAN meta-GGA for the excitation energies of several important systems. We consider the energies of atoms with atomic number 1-18. For the hydrogen atom, where we use the exact electron density and have no multiplet splitting, we find significant improvement up the ladder from LSDA to PBE to SCAN. For the uniform gas, we find an effective mass different from the bare mass only with r2SCAN. We split the case of multi-electron atoms into non-aufbau excitations, where the highest-energy electron is excited to the lowest state in the next nl subshell (where accuracy is least limited by available basis sets), and spin-flip excitations, where the spin of an electorn is flipped, leading to a higher-energy state of the same nl configuration. We find reasonably accurate approximate excitation energies, except for the spin-flip cases where the auxiliary non-interacting wavefunction of a non-Hund's-rule spin state is not well-described by a single determinant.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoliang Zhang, Haechan Park</p>
            <p>Electron spin qubits operating at atomic clock transitions exhibit exceptionally long coherence times, making them promising candidates for scalable quantum information applications. In solid-state systems, interactions between qubits and lattice phonons are known to play a critical role in spin relaxation (T1) and decoherence (T2). In this work, we perform first-principles calculations on a Lu(II) complex spin qubit featuring a prominent clock transition. By employing advanced electronic structure methods, we quantitatively evaluate the influence of phonons on the hyperfine interaction, which serves as the primary spin-lattice coupling mechanism. Treating these phonon-induced variations as first-order perturbations, we apply the Redfield master equation to compute both T1 and T2, along with their temperature dependencies. For T1, we adopt a second quantization formalism to describe phonon interactions, while T2 is evaluated by explicitly integrating acoustic phonon contributions across the full Brillouin zone. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed magnetic field dependence of T2, including the coherence peak near 0.43 T, though the absolute values of T1 and T2 differ by one to two orders of magnitude. Analysis reveals that T1 is primarily governed by longitudinal phonons, whereas T2 is most strongly influenced by mid-wavelength, mid-energy acoustic modes. These findings provide a quantitative demonstration of the clock transition protective effect on spin qubit coherence and offer a transferable computational framework for evaluating spin-phonon interactions in other molecular spin qubits.</p>

            <p>Selenium (Se) has reemerged as a promising absorber material for indoor and tandem photovoltaics (PVs), and its alloys with Te (Se1-xTex) offer a widely tunable bandgap. Solution processing of this materials system offers a route to low-cost fabrication. However, solution processing of Se has, thus far, only used hydrazine, which is an extremely hazardous solvent. In this work, we prepare and isolate propylammonium poly-Se and poly-Se-Te precursors from a safer thiol-amine solvent system. We formulate molecular inks by dissolving the precursor n,n-dimethylformamide (DMF) with a monoethanolamine (EA) additive and process high-quality Se and Se1-xTex films with bandgaps ranging from 1.20 eV to 1.86 eV. We fabricate PVs from these films using TiO2 and MoO3 charge transport layers (CTLs) to achieve power conversion efficiencies as high as 2.73% for Se and 2.33% for Se0.7Te0.3 under solar simulation. Se devices show excellent stability with no degradation after 1 month in air, enabled by the excellent stability of Se and the use of inorganic CTLs. This work represents an important step towards low-cost solution-phase processing of Se and Se1-xTex alloys for PVs and photodetectors with low toxicity and high bandgap tunability.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that modest magnetic fields (a fraction of a Tesls), when applied during high-temperature crystal growth, can profoundly alter the structural and electronic ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled, antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using an iridate as a model system, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition. Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy, underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <h2>g-Factor Enhanced Upper Critical Field in Superconducting PdTe2 due to Quantum Confinement</h2>

            <p>The Pauli limiting field of superconductors determines the maximal possible value of magnetic field at which superconductivity remains possible. For weak-coupling superconductors, it is determined by an established relation that can be found by setting the condensation energy equal to the magnetization free energy. The latter is a function of the carrier g-factor. Here, we demonstrate in a van der Waals superconductor PdTe2, that quantum confinement can tune the effective g-factor causing the Pauli limit to become thickness dependent. We experimentally probe the in-plane upper critical field (Hc2||) of PdTe2 at intermediate thicknesses down to 20mK. Hc2|| is enhanced by more than an order of magnitude as the thickness is varied from 50nm down to 19nm. We model its temperature and thickness dependence, revealing that both orbital and spin Zeeman depairing mechanisms impact its value. While the variation of the orbital interaction is expected, our findings reveal how the Zeeman interaction impacts superconductivity in thin films. They aid in the search for mixed and odd pairing superconductivity where an enhancement of Hc2|| can be occasionally associated with those unconventional pairing symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Field-derivative torque induced magnetization reversal in ferrimagnetic Gd$_{3/2}$Yb$_{1/2}$BiFe$_5$O$_{12}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pratyay Mukherjee, Arpita Dutta, Somasree Bhattacharjee, Shovon Pal, Ritwik Mondal</p>
            <p>Understanding the mechanism of spin switching in ferrimagnets via the excitation of THz pulses holds promise for future-generation magnetic memory devices. Such spin switching can be accomplished by the Zeeman torque exerted by the THz pulses on the magnetic spins. Theoretical and experimental works have established that the field-derivative of a terahertz pulse also exerts a torque, field derivative torque (FDT). Here, we investigate the role of the FDT in the spin switching in ferrimagnetic Gd$_{3/2}$Yb$_{1/2}$BiFe$_5$O$_{12}$ using a computational approach. Our results foresee that the spin switching in the presence of the FDT requires less THz magnetic fields than the spin switching without the FDT. Without the FDT terms, the spin switching in the considered system requires an extremely high magnetic field. Furthermore, we compute the switching and non-switching contour diagrams to show that the FDT tremendously enhances the possibility of spin switching. These results not only shed light on the significance of the FDT in magnetization switching but also suggest materials where the switching effect is pronounced.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Interfacial Thermal Conductance in Graphene/Germanene van der Waals Heterostructure using an Optimized Interlayer Potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sapta Sindhu Paul Chowdhury, Sourav Thapliyal, Bheema Lingam Chittari, Santosh Mogurampelly</p>
            <p>Accurately modeling interfacial thermal transport in van der Waals heterostructures is challenging due to the limited availability of interlayer interaction potentials. We develop a pairwise interlayer potential for graphene/germanene van der Waals heterostructure using the binding energy obtained from ab-initio density functional theory calculations and use it to calculate the interfacial thermal conductivity. Our calculations reveal that the interfacial thermal conductivity shows superior tunability with external strain. The phonon density of states calculations show a blueshift in the phonon spectra with an applied compressive strain in the direction of heat flow, increasing the interfacial thermal conductance to $\sim$136% of the unstrained value. In contrast, a tensile strain is found to cause an opposite effect, reducing the conductance to $\sim$70% of the unstrained value. Moreover, due to increased availability of phonons for heat transfer, both temperature and interaction strength are found to correlate positively with the interfacial thermal conductance for both directions of heat flow.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic and Crystal Symmetry Effects on Spin Hall Conductivity in Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dameul Jeong, Seoung-Hun Kang, Young-Kyun Kwon</p>
            <p>Altermagnets, which reconcile zero net magnetization with pronounced spin splitting, offer fresh opportunities for spin-based functionalities in next-generation electronic and spintronic devices. In this paper, we explore the unconventional spin Hall conductivity (USHC) in three prototypical altermagnets -- RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe -- and elucidate how distinct magnetic and crystal symmetries modulate their spin Hall responses. RuO$_2$ exhibits only trivial USHC contributions under a tilted geometry, demonstrating that symmetry projections alone can induce apparent unconventional elements. In contrast, CrSb and MnTe manifest robust, symmetry-driven USHC without structural tilts, enabled by easy-axis orientations that reduce magnetic symmetry. Through extensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the complementary roles of the time-reversal-even and time-reversal-odd components in determining the overall SHC. Our findings indicate that controlling the interplay between crystal and magnetic symmetry -- for instance, by epitaxial strain or doping -- can provide an experimental avenue to tune USHC magnitudes and directions in altermagnets. These results pave the way for the engineering of multifunctional spintronic devices, where enhanced coherence and robust spin transport are realized in zero-net-moment materials with easily tailored spin configurations.</p>

            <p>We report proximate quantum spin liquid behavior in K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ with the magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions embedded on a highly frustrated three-dimensional double trillium lattice. Single-crystal and high-resolution synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction experiments reveal a structural phase transition at $T_{\rm t} \simeq 125$ K from high-temperature cubic to low-temperature monoclinic phase with the three-fold superstructure. Magnetization and heat capacity consistently show the formation of the $J_{\rm eff} =1/2$ state of Co$^{2+}$ below 50 K. In zero field, K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ shows signatures of static magnetic order formed below $T^* \simeq 0.6$ K, but muon spin relaxation experiments reveal a large fluctuating component that persists down to at least 50 mK, reminiscent of quantum spin liquid (QSL). Static order is completely suppressed in the small magnetic field of $\sim 1$ T, and low-temperature heat capacity demonstrates the $T^2$ behavior above this field, another fingerprint of QSL. Ab initio calculations show a competition of several antiferromagnetic couplings that render K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ a promising pseudospin-$\frac12$ material for studying quantum magnetism in the double trillium lattice geometry.</p>

            <p>We have developed an operando laser-based photoemission electron microscope (laser-PEEM) with a ferroelectric characterization system. A Sawyer-Tower circuit was implemented to measure the polarization-voltage ($P-V$) characteristics of ferroelectric devices. Using this system, we successfully obtained the well-defined $P-V$ hysteresis loops for a ferroelectric capacitor incorporating Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO), reproducing the typical field-cycling characteristics of HZO capacitors. After dielectric breakdown caused by field-cycling stress, we visualized a conduction filament through the top electrode without any destructive processing. Additionally, we successfully observed polarization contrast through the top electrode of an oxide semiconductor (InZnO$_x$). These results indicate that our operando laser-PEEM system is a powerful tool for visualizing conduction filaments after dielectric breakdown, the ferroelectric polarization contrasts, and electronic state distribution of materials implemented in ferroelectric devices, including ferroelectric field-effect transistors and ferroelectric tunnel junctions.</p>

            <h2>Doping $S=1$ antiferromagnet in one-dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Prokopczyk, J. Herbrych</p>
            <p>Antiferromagnetic ground states, when doped, give rise to rich and complex phenomena, prompting detailed investigations in various spin systems. Here, we study the effect of doping on the one-dimensional $S = 1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (AFM). Specifically, we investigate how the presence of holes affects the static and dynamic (frequency-dependent) spin-spin correlations of the two-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori chain. The latter, at half-filling and in the limit of strong interactions, maps onto an $S = 1$ Heisenberg model. For moderate interactions, an orbital resonating-valence-bond (orbital-RVB) state emerges up to doping levels of $x \lesssim 0.4$. A detailed analysis of interaction strength $U$ and doping concentration $x$ reveals that this phase inherits the key features of spin excitations found in the half-filled case -- namely, a gapped spin spectrum and ``coherent'' magnon behavior up to a wavevector $q$ determined by the Fermi vector, $2k_\mathrm{F} = \pi(1 - x)$. Furthermore, our results uncover an additional broad, incoherent spectral weight for $q \gtrsim 2k_\mathrm{F}$ at high frequencies. Finally, we show that near the transition to a ferromagnetic phase, a previously unidentified spiral-like state emerges, characterized by spin excitations reminiscent of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model.</p>

            <p>We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice. The Mashhoon fringe shift, which characterizes the dynamics of intrinsic spin, retains its conventional form in graphene, with its dependence on the Fermi velocity. Our analysis highlights both the similarities and differences between spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in graphene.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher E Patrick</p>
            <p>RT\textsubscript{12} materials continue to attract attention due to their potential use as ``rare-earth-lean'' permanent magnets, but converting their promising intrinsic properties into practical high performance remains an elusive goal. Sophisticated experimental characterization techniques are providing unprecedented insight into the structure of these materials at the atomistic scale. Atomistic spin dynamics or micromagnetics simulations could help unravel the links between these structures and resultant magnet performance, but require input data describing the intrinsic magnetic properties. Here, first-principles calculations based on density-functional theory are used to determine these properties for two model interface structures which have been derived from recently reported high resolution electron microscopy images. One model structure is a stoichiometric twin formed by mirroring the RT\textsubscript{12} structure in the (101) plane, and the other model structure is a ``stacking fault'' involving the insertion of a RT\textsubscript{4} plane and a displacement along the [100] axis. Magnetic moments and crystal field coefficients have been calculated for the optimized structures. The interfaces modify the magnetic properties at the sub-nm scale. In particular, in the R-rich region of the ``stacking fault'', the local easy axis of magnetization rotates by $49^\circ$ from its bulk direction, which may lead to reduced coercivity through the easier nucleation of reverse domains.</p>

            <p>Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--Hückel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is a general property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.</p>

            <p>As integrated circuits continue to scale down and adopt three-dimensional (3D) stacking, thermal management in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) has emerged as a critical design constraint. In this study, we present a combined experimental and simulation framework to quantitatively characterize and mechanistically understand thermal transport in BEOL multilayers. Using the Square-Pulsed Source (SPS) method, a time-resolved optical metrology technique, we measure cross-plane thermal resistance and areal heat capacity in semiconductor chips at nanometer resolution. Two fabricated chip samples, polished to the M4 and M6 interconnection layers, are analyzed to extract thermal properties of distinct multilayer stacks. Results show that thermal resistance follows a series model, while areal heat capacity scales linearly with metal content. To uncover the underlying physical mechanisms, we perform finite element simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics, examining the influence of via connectivity and dielectric thermal conductivity on effective cross-plane heat transport. The simulations reveal that dielectric materials, due to their large volume fraction, are the primary limiting factor in BEOL thermal conduction, while the via structure plays a secondary but significant role. This combined experimental-simulation approach provides mechanistic insight into heat transport in advanced IC architectures and offers practical guidance for optimizing thermal pathways in future high-performance 3D-stacked devices.</p>

            <p>The design of shape memory alloys (SMAs) with high transformation temperatures and large mechanical work output remains a longstanding challenge in functional materials engineering. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework based on generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion for the inverse design of high-performance SMAs. By coupling a pretrained GAN with a property prediction model, we perform gradient-based latent space optimization to directly generate candidate alloy compositions and processing parameters that satisfy user-defined property targets. The framework is experimentally validated through the synthesis and characterization of five NiTi-based SMAs. Among them, the Ni$_{49.8}$Ti$_{26.4}$Hf$_{18.6}$Zr$_{5.2}$ alloy achieves a high transformation temperature of 404 $^\circ$C, a large mechanical work output of 9.9 J/cm$^3$, a transformation enthalpy of 43 J/g , and a thermal hysteresis of 29 °C, outperforming existing NiTi alloys. The enhanced performance is attributed to a pronounced transformation volume change and a finely dispersed of Ti$_2$Ni-type precipitates, enabled by sluggish Zr and Hf diffusion, and semi-coherent interfaces with localized strain fields. This study demonstrates that GAN inversion offers an efficient and generalizable route for the property-targeted discovery of complex alloys.</p>

Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field framework, four distinct phases are identified: a Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper-type superfluid, a normal metallic phase, a nodal superfluid with topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (TBFSs), and Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states with finite center-of-mass momentum. Among these, the FFLO states and TBFSs exemplify two unconventional forms of superconductivity. Considering the simplicity of this model, with only one band, zero net magnetization, and $s$-wave paring, the emergence of both unconventional phases underscores the pivotal role of altermagnetic spin splitting in enabling exotic pairing phenomena. This analytical study not only offers a valuable benchmark for future numerical simulations, but also provides a concrete experimental roadmap for realizing FFLO states and TBFSs in altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals enable the observation of bulk magnetism in topological quantum phases. We report site-selective NMR spectroscopy that probes local static and dynamic spin susceptibility on the magnetic semimetal BaMnBi$_2$. We find that spontaneous staggered fields from antiferromagnetic Mn moments are completely canceled at the Bi layer hosting Dirac fermions. In an in-plane field, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ follows the cubic temperature dependence to low temperatures, manifesting the ideal Dirac semimetal with chemical potential close to the Dirac point. In an out-of-plane field, $1/T_1$ becomes a constant below 20 K, where the Laudau level appears, and is enhanced more than 100 times larger than under the in-plane field.

            <p>We study the dynamics of a $\textit{Sokoban random walker}$ moving in a disordered medium with obstacle density $\rho$. In contrast to the classic model of de Gennes with static obstacles that exhibits a percolation transition, the Sokoban walker is capable of modifying its environment by pushing a few surrounding obstacles. Surprisingly, even a limited pushing ability leads to a loss of the percolation transition. Through a combination of a rigorous large-deviation calculation and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the Sokoban model belongs to the Balagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan trapping universality class. The survival probability that the walker has not yet been trapped inside a cage exhibits stretched-exponential relaxation at late times. Furthermore, using the average trap size as a proxy, we identify a new trapping transition that replaces the classical percolation transition. This transition occurs at a threshold density $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ and separates two qualitatively distinct trapping regimes: a self-trapping regime at low density, where the walker becomes dynamically localized within a self-formed trap, and a pre-existing trapping regime at high density, where confinement arises from the initial arrangement of obstacles.</p>

            <p>Copper-based catalysts are of particular interest for electrochemical reduction of CO$_2$ (CO2RR) as products beyond CO can form. To improve activity and selectivity, several studies have focused on the addition of other elements as substitutional impurities. Although the adsorption of a single CO molecule has often been used as a descriptor for CO2RR activity, our recent calculations using the RPBE functional showed that multiple CO molecules can bind to first-row transition metal impurities. Here, we extend the study to second-row transition metals and also to a functional that explicitly includes dispersion interaction, BEEF-vdW. The binding energy of the first CO molecule on the impurity atom is found to be significantly larger than on the clean Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces, but the differential binding energy generally drops as more CO molecules adsorb. The dispersion interaction is found to make a significant contribution to the binding energy, in particular for the last and weakest bound CO molecule, the one that is most likely to participate in CO2RR. In some cases, four CO admolecules can bind more strongly on the impurity atom than on the clean copper surface. The adsorption of CO causes the position of the impurity atom to shift outwards and in some cases, even escape from the surface layer. The C-O stretch frequencies are calculated in order to identify possible experimental signatures of multiple CO adsorption.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered heliconical ferroelectric nematic (NTBF) phase is a unique example of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in a proper ferroelectric fluid. In this study, we investigate four homologous series of mesogenic compounds, differing in the degree of fluorination of the mesogenic core and bearing lateral alkoxy substituents of varying lengths, to understand how molecular architecture influences the formation and stability of the NTBF phase. Increasing the length of the lateral chain lowers the phase transition temperatures and suppresses smectic layer formation, enabling the emergence of the NTBF phase which replaces the orthogonal ferroelectric smectic A (SmAF) phase. This indicates a competition between lamellar and heliconical polar ordering, driven by the interplay of strong molecular dipoles and the self-segregation of chemically incompatible molecular segments that typically favor layered structures. Notably, the NTBF phase in these compounds exhibits exceptionally short helical pitch lengths, on the order of a few hundred nanometers, as revealed by selective light reflection and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Furthermore, for one of the studied compounds AFM imaging of one compound revealed a regular array of screw dislocations within the NTBF phase, suggesting a possible link to more complex modulated or twist-grain-boundary-like structures.</p>

            <p>Negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is the representative solid state defect qubit for quantum information science, offering long coherence time at room temperature. To achieve high sensitivity and spatial resolution, shallow NV center near the surface are preferred. However, shallow NV center suffers from surface states and spin noise which reduce the photostability and coherence time. In this work, we systematically study the NV center in recently reported two-dimensional diamond, known as diamane--using first-principles calculations. We show that the quantum confinement in finite-layer diamane, with appropriate surface passivation, could significantly modify the band structure. In particular, we identify oxygen surface termination capable of hosting NV center in diamane while optimizing photostability compared to bulk diamond. Furthermore, layer-dependent NV center demonstrates tunable zero-phonon-line and suppressed phonon side band, while retaining long coherence time. Our findings highlight diamane as a promising platform for NV-based quantum information processing with improved optical properties and stability</p>

            <p>Graphene is a material with great potential in the field of spintronics, combining good conductivity with low spin--orbit coupling (SOC), which allows for the transport of spin currents over long distances. However, this lack of SOC also limits the capacity for manipulating spin current. A key strategy to address this limitation is to induce SOC in graphene via proximity to other two-dimensional (2D) materials. Such proximity-induced SOC can enable spin--charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS$_\mathrm{2}$, inducing SCI for both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba--Edelstein effect (REE) or the unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS$_\mathrm{2}$ interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the conventional SHE in the proximitised graphene, or the unconventional SHE in the bulk of the ReS$_\mathrm{2}$. SCI due to in-plane spin is characterised over a wide range of temperature, up to 300 K and a range of gate voltages.</p>

            <h2>Rabi Oscillations Modulated Noise Squeezing in Active Quantum Dot Ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ori Gabai, Amnon Willinger, Igor Khanonkin, Vitalii Sichkovskyi, Johann Peter Reithmaier, Gadi Eisenstein</p>
            <p>Generation of squeezed light is usually implemented in nonlinear \c{hi}(2) or \c{hi}(3) materials. Semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers (SOAs) also offer non-linearities but they differ from passive elements in that they add amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE). In a semiconductor laser, squeezing to below the shot noise limit has been demonstrated. An SOA contains no cavity and it adds significant noise. Gain saturation can lead, in principle, to squeezing of the photon number quadrature to below the shot noise level but often the noise is reduced only to below the ASE level of a linear amplifier. At the same time, the noise in the phase quadrature increases according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Short resonant pulses interacting with a quantum dot SOA induce coherent effects such as Rabi oscillations. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that Rabi oscillations cause cyclical noise squeezing which varies periodically with the excitation pulse area. The noise in the present experiments does not reach the quantum limit so we term this condition quasi squeezing. It occurs during the portions of the Rabi cycle when the quantum dots provide gain and repeats with every fourfold increase of the pulse excitation energy which amounts to a 2{\pi} increase in pulse area. In all other cases, the noise exhibits the properties of a coherent state.</p>

We discuss applicability of the generalized Cutler-Mott relations for computing a figure of merit of the non-Fermi liquid quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide a versatile platform for quantum electronics. Experiments generally require encapsulating graphene within hBN flakes, forming a protective van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that preserves delicate properties of the embedded crystal. To produce functional devices, heterostructures are typically shaped by electron beam lithography and etching, which has driven progress in 2D materials research. However, patterns are primarily restricted to in-plane geometries such as boxes, holes, and stripes, limiting opportunities for advanced architectures. Here, we use thermal scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) to produce smooth topographic landscapes in vdW heterostructures, controlling the thickness degree of freedom with nanometer precision. We electrically gate a sinusoidal topography to impose an electric-field gradient on the graphene layer to spatially modulate charge-carrier doping. We observe signatures of the landscape in transport measurements-resistance-peak spreading and commensurability oscillations-establishing tSPL for tailoring high-quality quantum electronics.</p>

            <p>In gate-defined quantum dot systems, the conductance change of electrostatically coupled sensor dots allows the observation of the quantum dots' charge and spin states. Therefore, the sensor dot must be optimally sensitive to changes in its electrostatic environment. A series of conductance measurements varying the two sensor-dot-forming barrier gate voltages serve to tune the dot into a corresponding operating regime. In this paper, we analyze the noise characteristics of the measured data and define a criterion to identify continuous regions with a sufficient signal-gradient-to-noise ratio. Hence, accurate noise estimation is required when identifying the optimal operating regime. Therefore, we evaluate several existing noise estimators, modify them for 1D data, optimize their parameters, and analyze their quality based on simulated data. The estimator of Chen et al. turns out to be best suited for our application concerning minimally scattering results. Furthermore, using this estimator in an algorithm for flank-of-interest classification in measured data shows the relevance and applicability of our approach.</p>

            <p>Mass density is a vital property for improved biophysical understanding of and within biological samples. It is increasingly attracting active investigation, but still lacks reliable, non-contact techniques to accurately characterize it in biological systems. Contrary to popular belief, refractive index information alone is insufficient to determine a sample's mass density, as we demonstrate here theoretically and experimentally. Instead, we measured the nonlinear gain of stimulated Brillouin scattering to provide additional information for mass density estimation. This all-optical method reduces the estimation error tenfold, offering a more accurate and universal technique for mass density measurements.</p>

            <p>Understanding the electronic structure of transition-metal dopants in IV-VI semiconductors is critical for tuning their band structure. We analyze properties of Cr dopant in $Pb_{1-x}Sn_xTe$ and PbSe by magnetic and transport measurements, which are interpreted based on density functional calculations. We demonstrate that the pinning of the Fermi energy to the chromium resonant level occurs for both n-type and p-type $Pb_{1-x}Sn_xTe$ in the whole composition range. This enables us to determine the valence band and conduction band offsets at the PbTe/SnTe/PbSe heterointerfaces, which is important for designing high-prformance 2D transistors. Furthermore, the magnetic measurements reveal the presence of Cr ions in three charge states, $Cr^{3+}$, $Cr^{2+}$, and $Cr^{1+}$. The last one corresponds to the Cr dopants incorporated at the interstitial, and not the substitutional, sites. The measured concentrations of the interstitial and substitutional Cr are comparable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenzhou Guo, Xiaodong Zhou, Wenhong Wang, Zhenxiang Cheng, Xiaotian Wang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectric (FE) metals with ferrimagnetism represent a previously unexplored class of spintronic materials, where the interplay of ferroelectricity, metallicity, and magnetism enables strong magnetoelectric (ME) coupling and electrically tunable spintronic functionalities. Here, based on antiferromagnetic (AFM) metallic bilayers, we propose a general strategy for constructing 2D sliding FE ferrimagnetic (FiM) metals that can achieve tri-state switching, in which the FE polarization, spin splitting, and net magnetization are reversed simultaneously through FE switching. As a prototypical realization, we design a bilayer sliding FE metal with FiM order, derived from monolayer Fe5GeTe2-a van der Waals metal with intrinsic magnetic order close to room temperature. The system exhibits a FE transition from a nonpolar (NP) AFM phase to a FE FiM phase via interlayer sliding. The in-plane mirror symmetry breaking in FE metallic states lift the spin degeneracy that exists in the NP phase, leading to a sizable net magnetic moment and strong linear ME coupling. The interplay between metallicity and FE FiM gives rise to pronounced sign-reversible transport responses near the Fermi level, all of which can be fully electrically controlled by FE switching without reorienting the Néel order. Our results establish sliding FE metals with FiM as a promising platform for electrically reconfigurable, high-speed, and low-dissipation spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Drag Coefficient in Near-Critical Binary Mixtures: Solving Hydrodynamic Fields with Improved Numerics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunsuke Yabunaka</p>
            <p>We calculate the drag coefficient of a spherical particle suspended in a near-critical binary fluid mixture. To capture the scaling behavior associated with critical adsorption in the strong adsorption regime, we employ the framework of local renormalized functional theory. Previous theoretical studies encountered numerical difficulties when attempting to solve the coupled hydrodynamic and chemical potential equations, expressed as integral equations, for systems with large bulk correlation lengths. These difficulties limited direct comparison with experimental results. In this study, we overcome those limitations by reformulating the hydrodynamic equations as a set of ordinary differential equations using a compactified radial coordinate. This approach enables more stable numerical computation and facilitates the implementation of appropriate boundary conditions at large distances from the particle. As a result, we successfully compute the drag coefficient over a broader range of bulk correlation lengths than in previous works and compare our theoretical predictions with available experimental data.</p>

We analyze thermal stability, linear thermal expansion, and anharmonic heat capacity using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation.

            <p>The formation and characteristics of magnetic skyrmions are strongly governed by the symmetry of the underlying crystal structure. In this study, we report the discovery of a new trigonal polymorph of Cu2OSeO3, observed exclusively in nanoparticles. Electron diffraction and density functional theory calculations confirm its R3m space group, sharing C3v symmetry with Néel-type skyrmion hosts. This polymorph is likely stabilized by surface effects, suggesting that size-induced structural changes may drive a transformation from Bloch-type to Neel-type skyrmions in Cu2OSeO3. This hypothesis is consistent with prior unexplained observations of Neel-type skyrmions at the surfaces of bulk crystals, which may result from surface-specific structural distortions. Overall, these findings provide insights into the interplay between size, structure, and magnetism, opening pathways for controlling skyrmionic properties in nanoscale systems.</p>

            <p>Here we report the observation of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking superconductivity in a BiNi bilayer using terahertz (THz) polarimetry. Leveraging a novel high-precision THz polarimetry technique, we detect, in the superconducting state and at zero magnetic field, the smallest polarization rotation of THz light measured to date. By using the MgO substrate itself as an optical resonator, we can reference the Faraday and Kerr rotations to each other. We observe a low-frequency Kerr rotation on the order of several hundred microradians in the superconducting phase, a clear signature consistent with TRS-breaking superconductivity. Our measurements enable direct access to the THz-range Hall conductivity. Through a Kramers-Kronig analysis, we link these low-energy measurements to prior high-frequency magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) data. This connection provides critical insight into the nature of the TRS-breaking state, supporting a multiband superconducting scenario over a disordered single-band interpretation for the origin of the Kerr effect.</p>

            <p>Quantum dots must be tuned precisely to provide a suitable basis for quantum computation. A scalable platform for quantum computing can only be achieved by fully automating the tuning process. One crucial step is to trap the appropriate number of electrons in the quantum dots, typically accomplished by analyzing charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Training and testing automation algorithms require large amounts of data, which can be either measured and manually labeled in an experiment or simulated. This article introduces a new approach to the realistic simulation of such measurements. Our flexible framework enables the simulation of ideal CSD data complemented with appropriate sensor responses and distortions. We suggest using this simulation to benchmark published algorithms. Also, we encourage the extension by custom models and parameter sets to drive the development of robust, technology-independent algorithms. Code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tzu-chen Liu, Steven B. Torrisi, Chris Wolverton</p>
            <p>Short-range order (SRO) in the cation-disordered state is a controlling factor influencing the probability of finding Li$_{4}$ tetrahedron clusters in disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials. However, the prevalent Li$_4$ probability below the random limit across reported DRX compositions has not been systematically investigated, active strategies to surpass the random limit of Li$_4$ probability are lacking, and the fundamental ordering behavior on the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice remains insufficiently explored. This research quantitatively examines pair SRO parameters and Li$_x$TM$_{4-x}$ probabilities via exhaustive Monte Carlo mapping across a simplified subset of the parameter space. The results indicate that, in the disordered state, the Li$_4$ probability is governed by the nearest neighbor (NN) pair-wise SRO parameter, and that these quantities do not necessarily represent a simple attenuation of their corresponding low-temperature long-range order, particularly for the important cases of Layered and Spinel-like orderings. Strategies are proposed to mitigate or even reverse the lithium and transition metals mixing tendency of NN pair SRO to achieve Li$_4$ probabilities that exceed the random limit. This study advances the fundamental thermodynamic understanding of ordering behaviors, which can be generalized to any FCC system.</p>

            <p>Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications such as artificial image synthesis. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. In contrast to previous approaches that use a score function acting on the velocity coordinate of the active particle, time reversal is here achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate only. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential.</p>

            <p>Spin liquid and spin glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin-freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remain challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin liquid and spin glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among $p$ spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size $N$ dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of $p$. We show that the phase diagrams for different $p$ can be unified through a scaling with $N/p^2$, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin liquid phase and extends the spin glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin liquid phase transitions into the spin glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide new insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.</p>

            <p>We present a framework for analyzing collections of interacting hysterons through the lens of catastrophe theory. By modeling hysteron dynamics as a gradient system, we show how to construct hysteron transition graphs by characterizing the fold bifurcations of the dynamical system. Transition graphs represent the sequence of hysterons switching states, providing critical insights into the collective behavior of driven disordered media. Extending this analysis to higher codimension bifurcations, such as cusp bifurcations and crossings of fold curves, allows us to map out how the topology of transition graphs changes with variations in system parameters. This approach can suggest strategies for designing metamaterials capable of encoding targeted memory and computational functionalities, but it also highlights the rapid increase of design complexity with system size, further underscoring the computational challenges of controlling large hysteretic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nianrui Fu, Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan</p>
            <p>We present a systematic framework for constructing exactly-solvable lattice models of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases based on an enlarged version of the string-net model. We also gauge the global symmetries of our SET models to obtain string-net models of pure topological phases. Without invoking externally imposed onsite symmetry actions, our approach promotes the string-net model of a pure topological order, specified by an input unitary fusion category $\mathscr{F}$, to an SET model, specified by a multifusion category together with a set of isomorphisms. Two complementary construction strategies are developed in the main text: (i) promotion via outer automorphisms of $\mathscr{F}$ and (ii) promotion via the Frobenius algebras of $\mathscr{F}$. The global symmetries derived via these two strategies are intrinsic to topological phases and are thus termed blood symmetries, as opposed to adopted symmetries, which can be arbitrarily imposed on topological phases. We propose the concept of symmetry-gauging family of topological phases, which are related by gauging their blood symmetries. With our approach, we construct the first explicit lattice realization of a nonabelian-symmetry-enriched topological phase -- the $S_3$ symmetry-enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum-double phase. The approach further reveals the role of local excitations in SET phases and establishes their symmetry constraints.</p>

            <p>Any coarse-grained description of a nonequilibrium system should faithfully represent its latent irreversible degrees of freedom. However, standard dimensionality reduction methods typically prioritize accurate reconstruction over physical relevance. Here, we introduce a model-free approach to identify irreversible degrees of freedom in stochastic systems that are in a nonequilibrium steady state. Our method leverages the insight that a black-box classifier, trained to differentiate between forward and time-reversed trajectories, implicitly estimates the local entropy production rate. By parameterizing this classifier as a quadratic form of learned state representations, we obtain nonlinear embeddings of high-dimensional state-space dynamics, which we term Latent Embeddings of Nonequilibrium Systems (LENS). LENS effectively identifies low-dimensional irreversible flows and provides a scalable, learning-based strategy for estimating entropy production rates directly from high-dimensional time series data.</p>

Using Floquet engineering, we verify the existence of the topological zero modes in the commensurate off-diagonal AAH models, which have never been experimentally realized before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our quantum processor is large enough to capture the substantial topological features of a quantum system from its complex band structure, including Dirac points, the energy gap's closing, the difference between even and odd number of sites, and the distinction between edge and bulk states.

            <p>Electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials (2DMs) significantly outperform their silicon counterparts; however, silicon CMOS technology remains commercially predominant as it offers the capability to operate dense arrays of devices in a scalable fashion. In particular, graphene Hall sensors (GHSs) offer great improvements in magnetic field sensitivity and resolution compared to silicon Hall-effect sensors, making them extremely appealing for magnetic field imaging and biosensing. At present, GHS arrays have limited scalability compared to silicon CMOS since they require planar routing for biasing and multiplexing. In this work, we explore strategies to realize high-density graphene Hall sensor arrays by vertically connecting GHSs with silicon CMOS biasing and multiplexing circuitry, allowing the routing and circuitry to scale with the array. We investigate the importance of design choices in the chip layout and post-fabrication process in maximizing the reliability of graphene transfer onto mm-scale CMOS dies. Our experimental results validate the success of the integration process by showing for the first time that GHSs can be monolithically integrated with CMOS with high yield to form sensor arrays. We expect that these results will lead to further improvements in magnetic sensing technology and broader advancements in large-scale heterogeneous 2DM-CMOS systems.</p>

            <p>In Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) experiments, the acquisition parameters are generally kept constant throughout the collection of a data set. This limits data collection to one data set at a time, and frequent human interaction is required to maintain the image quality. Here, we use a custom-designed automation interface to minimize such supervision and allow for the collection of multiple interlaced data sets simultaneously. The oscillatory modes of an example catalytic system (hydrogen oxidation over Co foil) were employed as a tunable spatiotemporal test case. Using our automation interface, we can implement more advanced acquisition programs into the microscope that allow dual imaging - effectively bridging reaction monitoring between different length scales. By using automation to change the settings of the acquisition after each frame, we are able to capture alternating magnifications of the same process and sample location. Both a low magnification overview of the mesoscopic surface dynamics and a high magnification field of view of the ongoing structural changes of a selected surface motif were acquired. Using such truly correlative data captured with the dual magnification method, cross-scale correlations about catalytic systems including phase information can be established.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Patsoukis Dimou, Q. Lei, N. Watanabe, A. Suzuki</p>
            <p>We present a novel experimental approach based on 3D printing and X-ray computed tomography to characterize fracture aperture distribution and evolution in 3D fracture networks under varying stress loading conditions. We validate our methodology by comparing experimentally measured stress-dependent fracture apertures with both analytical solutions and numerical simulations, for both single fracture and fracture network scenarios. We show that, for fracture deformation under linear elastic regime, our experimental results agree with numerical simulation. Furthermore, by combining our new experimental methodology with advanced numerical simulations, we illuminate the complex interplay of stress and topology in fracture network deformation. Our approach opens the door for experimentally observing deformable fracture networks under stress in 3D space, which has significant implications for understanding and predicting many geophysical problems involving fractured geological media.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lance Yao, Suman Samantray, Ayana Ghosh, Kevin Roccapriore, Libor Kovarik, Sarah Allec, Maxim Ziatdinov</p>
            <p>The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial, unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source, multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments. By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.</p>

            <p>Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials. We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model (BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query, surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs, and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.</p>

            <h2>Learning to stabilize nonequilibrium phases of matter with active feedback using partial information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Cemin, Markus Schmitt, Marin Bukov</p>
            <p>We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in (1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that, above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.</p>

            <h2>Local Diffusion Models and Phases of Data Distributions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangjun Hu, Guangkuo Liu, Yifan Zhang, Xun Gao</p>
            <p>As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions, which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers. Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This result also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions, the broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the design of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lautaro Giordano, Ignacio Cortés, Sebastian Gonçalves, María Fabiana Laguna</p>
            <p>Wealth inequality remains a critical socioeconomic challenge, driven by systemic dynamics and self-reinforcing mechanisms that amplify the economic imbalances. Simplified models from statistical physics provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing wealth distribution. In this study, we extend the Yard-Sale model -- a minimal kinetic exchange framework -- to investigate how limiting risk in economic transactions affects inequality. While previous research demonstrates that such models naturally lead to wealth concentration, we introduce a mechanism that restricts the maximum risk agents can assume during exchanges. Numerical simulations reveal that this modification fosters more equitable wealth distributions and significantly reduces extreme disparities. These findings highlight the importance of individual-level constraints in shaping systemic outcomes, offering new perspectives on promoting economic balance.</p>

            <h2>Wealth Inequality in Agent-Based Economies: The Dominant Role of Social Protection over Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gastón Villafañe, Lautaro Giordano, María Fabiana Laguna</p>
            <p>Persistent wealth inequality, where a small fraction of the population accumulates most resources while the majority remains economically vulnerable, is a widespread phenomenon. We investigate its underlying mechanisms using an agent-based Yard-Sale model that incorporates two complementary features: transaction rules that favor poorer agents, representing social protection policies, and an economic growth process with explicit wealth redistribution. Our results reveal that social protection plays a dominant role in reducing inequality, while redistribution primarily serves to reintegrate excluded agents. These findings suggest that social protection policies, that is, targeted mechanisms favoring economically vulnerable agents, may have a substantially greater impact on reducing inequality than redistribution driven solely by economic growth. We also find that both the shape of the wealth distributions and the resulting inequality levels are strongly influenced by the underlying distribution of individual risk, highlighting the importance of considering agent heterogeneity when modeling economic dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Modeling revolutions in networked societies: learning from the Tunisian spring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Aguilar-Velázquez, Denis Boyer, Robert Boyer</p>
            <p>Economic competition and deregulation have led to a polarization of societies between a small, increasingly powerful elite and a majority of socially excluded individuals, marginalized and unconnected to political representations. This is the breeding ground for protest movements, relayed by local ties and amplified by social networks. Based on the characteristics revealed by socio-economic research into the Arab revolutions of the 2010s, this article proposes a formalization inspired by the theory of complex systems. We discuss the conditions under which an initial localized event - for example, the suicide of a street vendor condemned to ruin in a small Tunisian town - can trigger an explosion of the number of opponents to the regime, typical of a revolutionary episode. We consider a network model of agents and oppressors where pair interactions are controlled by a fear parameter, or the inclination of the individuals to rebel despite of repression. The model exhibits a phase transition at a critical threshold above which the quiescent state becomes unstable. Furthermore, the ability of individuals to forge triadic relationships accelerates the process of joining a rising rebellion, making the transition more abrupt, in the form of a brutal discontinuity that can be described as revolutionary. The imposition of a counter-revolution by the hardening of repression can be explained by the hysteresis property displayed by the model: when mobilization has extended the initial network and made it partially permanent, repression by the authorities must be tightened to higher levels than before to regain control.</p>

            <h2>Response Theory for Static and Dynamic Solvation of Ionic and Dipolar Solutes in Water</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renjie Zhao, Richard C. Remsing, John D. Weeks</p>
            <p>The response of polar solvents to ions and polar molecules dictates many fundamental molecular processes. To understand such electrostatically-driven solvation processes, one ideally would probe the dielectric response of a solvent to an idealized point test charge or dipole solute, as envisioned in classic continuum treatments of the problem. However, this is difficult in simulations using standard atomically-detailed solvent models with embedded point charges due to possible overlap with the test charge that lead to singular interaction energies. This problem is traditionally avoided for a realistic charged solute by introducing an excluded volume core that shields its embedded point charge or dipole from the charges in the solvent. However, this core introduces additional molecular-scale perturbations of the solvent density that complicate the interpretation of solvent dielectric response. In this work, we avoid these complications through the use of Gaussian-smoothed test charges and dipoles. Gaussian charges and dipoles can be readily inserted anywhere into an atomistic solvent model without encountering infinite energies. If the Gaussian-smoothing is on the scale of molecular correlations in the solvent, both the thermodynamic and dynamic solvation response is linear. Using this observation, we construct accurate predictive theories for solvation free energies and solvation dynamics for insertion of Gaussian charges and dipoles in polar solvents and demonstrate the accuracy of the theories for a widely-used model of water. Our results suggest that Gaussian test charge distributions can be used as an informative probe of dielectric response in molecular models, and our theories can be used to analytically predict the largest component of solvation free energies of charged and polar solutes.</p>

Here we explore this phenomenon, using theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study angular momentum generation in several driven chiral molecular models. We demonstrate that significant vibrational angular momentum can be induced under both mechanical and thermal driving, with magnitude comparable to that induced in optically driven chiral phonons. We find that generation of angular momentum is a common and general phenomenon in driven chiral structures, highlighting the role of symmetry-breaking in the (non-equilibrium) internal atomic motion of such systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Liang Tao, Huaxin He, Hao Lyu, Yongping Zhang, Yong Xu</p>
            <p>Nonlinearity enables the emergence of localized waves such as solitons that maintain their shapes during propagation. Solitons are broadly classified into bright and dark solitons. While a bright soliton exhibits a density peak, a dark soliton presents as a defect on a continuous wave background. A distinctive feature of dark solitons is the abrupt phase change in their wave function, which can host Majorana zero modes in topological fermionic superfluids. Recent studies have shown that bright solitons can undergo quantized transport through Thouless pumping, where the bright soliton functions as a Wannier function. However, it remains unclear whether Thouless pumping can also occur for dark solitons, which fundamentally differ from bright solitons. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the occurrence of both integer and fractional Thouless pumping for dark solitons within both a continuous model under optical lattices and a tight-binding model. Specifically, we find that a dark soliton is transported by one or half a unit cell, following the center-of-mass position of a Wannier function, as a system parameter is slowly varied over one cycle. Our work opens new avenues for exploring Thouless pumping for defects with phase changes, such as dark solitons, vortex solitons, ring dark solitons, and vortices.</p>

            <p>The molecular structure of water at charged aqueous interfaces is shaped by interfacial electric fields, which can induce significant anisotropy in the molecular orientations that extends over nanometer-scale distances. Despite great relevance, very little is known about the details of this depth-dependent anisotropic water structure, mainly due to the lack of appropriate experimental techniques. Here, we present a time-domain spectrometer specifically developed to acquire depth-resolved nonlinear vibrational spectra at aqueous interfaces. The approach is based on combining phase-resolved vibrational sum- and difference-frequency spectra and enables the extraction of depth information on the nanometer scale. The analysis of the acquired resonant spectral line shapes meanwhile yields insight into local hydrogen-bond structures and anisotropic molecular orientations across the interfacial region. In measurements with insoluble charged surfactants, we demonstrate that the obtained data allows for a full reconstruction of the nonlinear vibrational responses as function of depth. The results show the presence of two pronounced regions within the interfacial anisotropy with largely deviating degrees of preferential molecular orientations. A spectral analysis of the depth-dependent vibrational responses furthermore reveals that the natural local hydrogen-bond structure of bulk water remains intact throughout the interfacial region, including water in the direct proximity of the surface charges. These findings significantly refine our understanding of the anisotropic water structure at the interface to charged surfactants and showcase the large potential of our depth-resolved spectroscopic technique.</p>

            <p>Wigner crystals formed by laser-cooled ions in traps are unconventional condensed-matter systems, characterized by interparticle distances of several micrometers and energy scales on the order of $\mu$eV. Their crystalline structure emerges from the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the external confining potential, which can be readily tuned. Moreover, individual ions can be precisely manipulated with lasers and imaged via resonance fluorescence. These unusual and unique properties make ion crystals a powerful platform for studying phases of matter and their dynamics in the strongly correlated quantum regime. This review examines the theoretical framework and experimental characterization of ion Coulomb crystals from a condensed-matter perspective. We highlight their dynamical and thermodynamic properties in one, two, and three dimensions, along with recent investigations into their out-of-equilibrium behavior. We provide outlooks on future directions for exploring novel condensed matter phenomena with trapped ion crystals, as well as their many scientific and technical applications, which have driven advances in controlling and measuring ion crystals in the lab.</p>

            <p>Mitigating noise-induced decoherence is the central challenge in controlling open quantum systems. While existing robust protocols often require precise noise models, we introduce a universal framework for noise-agnostic quantum control that achieves high-fidelity operations without prior environmental noise characterization. This framework capitalizes on the dynamical modification of the system-environment coupling through control drives, an effect rigorously encoded in the dynamical equation. Since the derived noise sensitivity metric remains independent of the coupling details between the system and the environment, our protocol demonstrates provable robustness against arbitrary Markovian noises. Numerical validation through quantum state transfer and gate operations reveals near-unity fidelity ($>\!99\%$) across diverse noise regimes, achieving orders-of-magnitude error suppression compared to target-only approaches. This framework bridges critical gaps between theoretical control design and experimental constraints, establishing a hardware-agnostic pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum technologies across platforms such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and solid-state qubits.</p>

            <p>Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of particular outcomes out of a set of mutually-exclusive possibilities for stochastic processes and play a central role in first-passage problems. For two-dimensional Markov processes $\{X(t),Y(t)\}_{t\in T}$, a joint analogue of the splitting probabilities can be defined, which captures the likelihood that the variable $X(t)$, having been initialised at $x_0 \in \mathbb{L}$, exits $\mathbb{L}$ for the first time via either of the interval boundaries \emph{and} that the variable $Y(t)$, initialised at $y_0$, is given by $y_{\rm exit}$ at the time of exit. We compute such joint splitting probabilities for two classes of processes: processes where $X(t)$ is Brownian motion and $Y(t)$ is a decoupled internal state, and unidirectionally coupled processes where $X(t)$ is drift-diffusive and depends on $Y(t)$, while $Y(t)$ evolves independently. For the first class we obtain generic expressions in terms of the eigensystem of the Fokker-Planck operator for the $Y$ dynamics, while for the second we carry out explicit derivations for three paradigmatic cases (run-and-tumble motion, diffusion in an intermittent piecewise-linear potential and diffusion with stochastic resetting). Drawing on Bayes' theorem, we subsequently introduce the related notion of conditional splitting probabilities, defined as the posterior likelihoods of the internal state $Y$ \emph{given} that the observable degree of freedom $X$ has undergone a specific exit event. After computing these conditional splitting probabilities, we propose a simple scheme that leverages them to partially infer the assumedly hidden state $Y(t)$ from point-wise detection events.</p>

Generically, the NESS on an infinite system does not equal the thermodynamic limit of NESSs on finite systems. We give a sufficient condition that they coincide with each other, in terms of both a condition number, which quantifies the normality of a Liouvillian, and some spectral gaps on finite subsystems. To appreciate the importance of the condition number, we provide an example in which the spectral gaps have nonzero lower bounds uniformly for any finite subsystems but a thermodynamic limit and a long-time limit (or a long-time average) do not commute with each other.</p>

            <p>An algorithm is proposed for constructing quasi-random "peaked" quantum circuits, i.e., circuits whose final qubit state exhibits a high probability concentration on a specific computational basis state. These circuits consist of random gates arranged in a brick-wall architecture. While the multiqubit state in the middle of the circuit can exhibit significant entanglement, the final state is, with high probability, a predetermined pure bitstring. A technique is introduced to obscure the final bitstring in the structure of the quantum circuit. The algorithm allows precise control over the probability of the final peaked state. A modified version of the algorithm enables the construction of double- or multi-peaked quantum circuits. The matrix product state (MPS) method is evaluated for simulating such circuits; it performs effectively for shallow peaked circuits but offers no significant advantage for deeper ones.</p>

The systems under consideration are described by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories (2d holographic CFTs), the theories described by gravity. Then, we find that the time ordering of Euclidean and Lorentzian time evolutions affects the behavior of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation, especially their late-time ones. We also establish the relation between entanglement entropy and energy-momentum densities. This relation states that the late-time behaviors of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation strongly depend on the energy distribution. We also examine how the decay of the quasiparticle influences the bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation. Furthermore, we investigate the gravity dual of the systems considered in this paper.</p>

As a prominent example we consider the antiferromagnetic quantum Ising model in transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields which is in demand in both condensed matter physics and quantum computing. We show that the neural network approach gives reliable estimates of the classical mutual information even in the case of paramagnetic wave functions delocalized in the state space. In addition, the phase diagram of the considered quantum system is reconstructed with a special focus on discriminating various types of disordered states.</p>

            <p>Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a cornerstone framework that describes light-matter interactions rooted in Abelian symmetries, renders the harnessing of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields as a fundamental yet uncharted frontier. Here, we develop a general theory of light-matter interaction of quantum emitters embedded in non-Abelian photonic lattices. Based on analytical solutions to the non-Abelian Landau dressed states beyond the continuum limit, we reveal chiral photon emission and vortices with emergent nonreciprocity enabled by selective coupling between emitters and spin-momentum-locked bands. When coexisting with Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic fields, emitters hybridize with Landau dressed orbits to form spin-polarized, squeezed Landau polaritons that carry quantized angular momenta, with Rabi frequencies tunable via Landau levels and pseudospin interactions. Multi-emitter dynamics further exhibit collective phenomena governed by real-space staggered phases induced by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. These results bridge non-Abelian physics with quantum optics, and establish non-Abelian gauge fields as a versatile tool for synthesizing topological quantum optical states, angular momentum transfer, and controlling photon-mediated correlations in QED systems, relevant for applications in quantum simulations and chiral quantum optical networks.</p>

            <h2>Observation and Modulation of the Quantum Mpemba Effect on a Superconducting Quantum Processor</h2>

            <p>In non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) emerges as a counterintuitive phenomenon: systems exhibiting greater initial symmetry breaking restore symmetry faster than those with less. While theoretical exploration of QME has surged, experimental studies on its multidimensional modulation remain limited. Here, we report the observation and control of QME using a superconducting processor featuring a unique fully connected, tunable-coupling architecture that enables precise modulation from short- to long-range interactions. This platform allows independent manipulation of coupling regimes, on-site potentials, and initial states, elucidating their roles in QME. To quantify symmetry restoration, we employ entanglement asymmetry (EA) -- the relative entropy between a subsystem reduced density matrix and its symmetric projection -- as a sensitive probe of symmetry breaking. In strong short-range coupling regimes, EA crossovers during quenches from tilted Néel states confirm the presence of QME. In contrast, in intermediate coupling regimes, synchronized EA and entanglement entropy dynamics reveal the suppression of QME. Remarkably, QME reemerges with the introduction of on-site linear potentials or quenches from tilted ferromagnetic states, the latter proving robust against on-site disorder. Our study provides the first demonstration of flexible QME modulation on a superconducting platform with multiple controllable parameters, shedding light on quantum many-body non-equilibrium dynamics and opening avenues for quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>Material Fingerprinting: A shortcut to material model discovery without solving optimization problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moritz Flaschel, Denisa Martonová, Carina Veil, Ellen Kuhl</p>
            <p>We propose Material Fingerprinting, a new method for the rapid discovery of mechanical material models from direct or indirect data that avoids solving potentially non-convex optimization problems. The core assumption of Material Fingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected to a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the material's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all pertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics. Consequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and their corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly characterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by measuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to identify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we explore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating the applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental setups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments involving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress data pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly shaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect displacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases, Material Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the challenges of potentially non-convex optimization. We believe that Material Fingerprinting provides a powerful and generalizable framework for rapid material model identification across a wide range of experimental designs and material behaviors, paving the way for numerous future developments.</p>

            <h2>Master Equation for Quantum Self-Organization of Atoms and Molecules in Cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Schmit, Catalin-Mihai Halati, Tobias Donner, Giovanna Morigi, Simon B. Jäger</p>
            <p>Quantum gases of atoms and molecules in optical cavities offer a formidable laboratory for studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of long-range interacting systems. Multiple scattering of cavity photons mediate interactions, and the emerging phases of matter are determined by the interplay of photon-mediated forces, dissipation, and quantum and thermal fluctuations. Control of these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms at play. Due to the number of degrees of freedom, however, effective theoretical models often work in specific limits, where either the cavity field is treated as a semiclassical variable or the cavity state is a slightly perturbed vacuum state. In this work, we present the derivation of an effective Lindblad master equation for the dynamics of the sole motional variables of polarizable particles, such as atoms or molecules, that dispersively couple to the cavity field. The master equation is valid even for relatively large intracavity photon numbers, and is apt to study both the steady-state regime and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics where quantum fluctuations of the field seed the onset of macroscopic coherences. We validate the theoretical description by showing that it captures the dynamics across a wide temperature interval, from Doppler cooling down to the ultra-cold regime, and from weak to strong cavity-mediated interactions. Our theory provides a powerful framework for the description of the dynamics of quantum gases in cavities and permits, amongst others, to connect models and hypotheses of statistical mechanics with a versatile experimental platform.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Rapp, Radhika H. Joshi, Alwin van Steensel, Yuli V. Nazarov, Mohammad H. Ansari</p>
            <p>Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Circuit Complexity of Matrix-Product Unitaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgios Styliaris, Rahul Trivedi, J. Ignacio Cirac</p>
            <p>Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this paper, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ is the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.</p>

            <p>Accurate measurement of atomic temperature is essential for a wide range of applications, from quantum sensing to precision metrology. In optical lattice clocks, precise characterization of atomic temperature is required to minimize systematic uncertainties at the $10^{-18}$ level. In this work, we investigate atomic temperature measurements in the ytterbium optical lattice clock developed at INRIM, IT-Yb1, employing sideband and Doppler spectroscopy across a wide range of trapping conditions. By implementing clock-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling, we reduce the atomic temperature and enable operation at shallower lattice depths down to $D = 50E_{R}$. We compare temperature estimates obtained from the harmonic oscillator model with those derived using a Born-Oppenheimer-based approach, which is expected to provide a more accurate description of atomic motion in both longitudinal and radial directions, especially for hotter atoms whose motion deviates from the harmonic regime. Discrepancies up to a factor of two in extracted temperatures are observed depending on the chosen model. We assess the impact of these modeling differences on the evaluation of lattice frequency shifts and find deviations up to $8\times10^{-17}$. Even though extended Sisyphus cooling reduces these inconsistencies to the $1\times10^{-18}$ level or below, residual biases may still limit the accuracy of optical lattice clocks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Faria, C.C. Nelmes, T.J.G. Apollaro, T.P. Spiller, I. D'Amico</p>
            <p>Quantum state transfer is investigated beyond the nearest-neighbour coupling scheme in long spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ linear chains. Exploiting the properties of the next-nearest neighbour Hamiltonian's dispersion relation, it is shown that with minimal engineering, i.e., an on-site magnetic field on the two end sites and only a few symmetrically-modified end inter-site couplings, an average transfer fidelity above $99\%$ can be achieved. To leading order, the required time scales linearly with the length of the chain. Such a fast, high-quality quantum state transfer is based on the ballistic propagation of the wave packet centred in the linear region of the dispersion relation by means of the on-site magnetic field. At the same time, the wave packet width, modulated by the inter-site couplings at the chain ends, whose values are found via a carefully designed genetic algorithm, is constrained mostly in the linear region of the dispersion relation. Our coupling scheme is shown to hold for arbitrary values of the next-nearest inter-site coupling and can be straightforwardly applied to longer range coupling schemes.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian extensions of the Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model reveal a rich variety of phase transitions arising from the interplay of quasiperiodicity and non-Hermiticity. Despite their theoretical significance, experimental explorations remain challenging due to complexities in realizing controlled non-Hermiticity. Here, we present the first experimental realization of the unitary almost-Mathieu operator (UAMO) which simulates the AAH model by employing single-photon quantum walks. Through precise control of quasiperiodicity, we systematically explore the phase diagram displaying a phase transition between localized and delocalized regimes in the Hermitian limit. Subsequently, by introducing non-reciprocal hopping, we experimentally probe the parity-time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition that is characterized by the emergence of complex quasienergies. Moreover, we identify a novel spectral transition exclusive to discrete-time settings, where all quasienergies become purely imaginary. Both transitions are connected to changes in the spectral winding number, demonstrating their topological origins. These results clarify the interplay between localization, symmetry breaking, and topology in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, paving the way for future exploration of synthetic quantum matter.</p>

            <p>How frictional effects emerge at the microscopic level in particulate materials remains a challenging question, particularly in systems subject to thermal fluctuations due to the transient nature of interparticle contacts. Here, we directly relate particle-level frictional arrest to local coordination in an attractive colloidal model system. We reveal that the orientational dynamics of particles slows down exponentially with increasing coordination number due to the emergence of frictional interactions, the strength of which can be tuned simply by varying the attraction strength. Using a simple computer simulation model, we uncover how the interparticle interactions govern the formation of frictional contacts between particles. Our results establish quantitative relations between friction, coordination and interparticle interactions. This is a key step towards using interparticle friction to tune the mechanical properties of particulate materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Xin Wang, Yi-Fan Jiang, Hong Yao</p>
            <p>Increasing numerical studies showed that the simplest Hubbard model on the square lattice with strong repulsion may not exhibit high-temperature superconductivity (SC). It is desired to look for other possible microscopic mechanism of realizing high-temperature SC. Here, we explore the interplay between the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and the Hubbard repulsion by density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) simulations. Our state-of-the-art DMRG study showed convincingly that the interplay between strong Hubbard $U$ and moderate Su-Schrieffer-Heeger EPC $\lambda$ can induce robust $d$-wave SC. The SSH-type EPC can generate effective antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions between neighboring sites, which plays a crucial role in the interplay of inducing robust $d$-wave SC. Specifically, for $U=8t$, we find that $d$-wave SC emerges when $\lambda>\lambda_c$ with a moderate critical value $\lambda_c=0.1\sim 0.2$. Our results might shed new light to understanding high-temperature SC in cuprates as well as pave a possible new route in looking for high-temperature SC in other quantum materials with both strong $U$ and moderate $\lambda$.</p>

Our findings reveal a universal correlation between the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of iron and the induced magnetic dipole moments within the BO$_2$ layer and basal oxygen atoms of ABO$_3$ at the FE/FM interface. By identifying key material descriptors and achieving high predictive accuracy, this research provides a robust framework for selecting and optimizing ABO$_3$ substrates for energy-efficient spintronic devices.

            <p>Ta3Sb is one of the A15 compounds that have been predicted to have giant spin Hall conductivities due to the gapped Dirac-like band crossings in their electronic structures. We use co-sputtering to directly synthesize thin films of Ta3Sb and identify a large window of Ta:Sb flux ratio that permits the formation of single-phase A15 structure. These sputtered films have an actual Ta:Sb atomic ratio of 4:1 as determined from Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Their high resistivity, at the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit, suggests that the electron mean free path is comparable to interatomic distances. From harmonic Hall and spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements, the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity of thin film Ta3Sb is estimated to be in the range of -526 to -1230 (hbar/e) S/cm at 300 K, lower in magnitude than the predicted value of -1400 (hbar/e) S/cm. First-principles calculations of the electronic structure show that the discrepancy is consistent with an increase of the Fermi level due to the non-ideal stoichiometry needed to stabilize the A15 structure.</p>

            <p>Steady illumination of a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor results in a bulk photovoltaic current, which is contributed by real-space displacements (`shifts') of charged quasiparticles as they transit between Bloch states. The shift induced by interband excitation via absorption of photons has received the prevailing attention. However, this excitation-induced shift can be far outweighed ($\ll$) by the shift induced by intraband relaxation, or by the shift induced by radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. This outweighing ($\ll$) is attributed to (i) time-reversal-symmetric, intraband Berry curvature, which results in an anomalous shift of quasiparticles as they scatter with phonons, as well as to (ii) topological singularities in the interband Berry phase (`optical vortices'), which makes the photovoltaic current extraordinarily sensitive to the linear polarization vector of the light source. Both (i-ii) potentially lead to nonlinear conductivities of order $mAV^{-2}$, without finetuning of the incident radiation frequency, band gap, or joint density of states. A case study of BiTeI showcases the anomalous shift and optical vorticity in a realistic material.</p>

            <p>A nonlocal string order parameter detecting topological order and deconfinement has been proposed by Fredenhagen and Marcu (FM). However, due to the lack of exact internal symmetries for lattice models and the nonlinear dependence of the FM string order parameter on ground states, it is a priori not guaranteed that it is a genuine order parameter for topological phase transitions. In this work, we find that the FM string order parameter exhibits universal scaling behavior near critical points of charge condensation transitions, by directly evaluating the FM string order parameter in the infinite string-length limit using infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) for the toric code in a magnetic field. Our results thus demonstrate that the FM string order parameter represents a quantitatively well-behaved order parameter. We find that only in the presence of an emergent 1-form symmetry the corresponding FM string order parameter can faithfully detect topological transitions.</p>

            <p>The concept of quantum geometry for single-particle states has revolutionized our interpretation of several emergent properties in condensed matter. However, a description of the quantum geometry for interacting particles and an understanding of its implications are lacking. Here, we show that inherent in the non-linear optical response is a quantum geometry of the correlated electron-hole state (exciton) that arises from the interplay between geometry and interactions - distinct from the quantum geometric properties of the individual electron or hole states. We demonstrate using first principles calculations that this quantum many-body geometry significantly enhances the non-linear optical response in systems with strong excitonic effects. In the case of shift currents, the quantum many-body geometric term arises in the many-body shift vector and can be interpreted as a many-body analogue of the Berry phase. This work lays the foundation to study the quantum geometry of correlated states in experimentally observable settings.</p>

            <p>At the quantum critical point of correlated materials, a non-Fermi liquid state appears where electron correlations continuously develop to very low temperatures. The relaxation time of the interacted electrons, namely quasiparticles, is scaled with the Planckian time, $\hbar/k_{\rm B}T$.

In the optical conductivity spectra, the Drude response will appear as the scaling of $\hbar\omega/k_{\rm B}T$ as the dynamical Planckian scaling (DPS). Here, we report the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the Drude response of a candidate for such materials, the quasi-kagome Kondo lattice CeRhSn. Even though the material shows a strong valence fluctuation, renormalized Drude responses observed at the photon energy below 100 meV are characterized by non-Fermi-liquid-like scattering rate $1/\tau$.

            <p>Quasiparticle excitations in material solids often experience a fictitious gauge field, which can be a potential source of intriguing transport phenomena. Here, we show that low-energy excitations in insulating antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals on the triangular lattice are effectively described by magnons with an SU(3) gauge field. The three-sublattice structure in the antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals is inherited as three internal degrees of freedom for the magnons, which are coupled to their kinetic motion via the SU(3) gauge field that arises from the topologically nontrivial spin texture in real space. We show that the non-commutativity of the SU(3) gauge field breaks an effective time-reversal symmetry and contributes to a magnon thermal Hall effect. We further demonstrate the emergence of the finite thermal Hall conductivity in the antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals by the linear spin-wave theory. The possible impact of different gauge structures on a thermal Hall conductivity is also discussed.</p>

            <p>The study of kagome materials has attracted much attention in the past few years due to the presence of many electron-electron interaction-driven phases in a single material. These include charge density waves, nematic phases, superconducting phases, and pair density waves. In this work, we report the discovery of intrinsic spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the thin-flake kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Firstly, when an in-plane magnetic field is swept in opposite directions, we observe a unique form of hysteresis in magnetoresistance which is different from the hysteresis induced by extrinsic mechanisms such as flux-trapping or superheating and supercooling effects. The unconventional hysteresis indicates the emergence of an intrinsic time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phase. Strikingly, at a fixed magnetic field, the finite-resistance state can be transitioned into the superconducting state by applying and subsequently removing a large current. Secondly, at temperatures around 400 mK, the re-entrance of superconductivity occurs during an in-plane field-sweeping process. This kind of re-entrance is asymmetric about the zero field axis and observed in all field directions for a fixed current direction, which is different from the re-entrance observed in conventional superconductors. These findings put very strong constraints on the possible superconducting pairing symmetry of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. We point out that the pairing symmetry, which is consistent with the crystal symmetry and all the observed novel properties, is possibly a time-reversal symmetry-breaking, p-wave pairing with net spin polarization. Importantly, this p-wave pairing gives rise to a nodal topological superconducting state with Majorana flat bands on the sample edges.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect and generalized Fermi surface formula in arbitrary dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Zhang, Chang Shu, Kai Sun</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by a proliferation of exponentially localized edge modes in open-boundary systems, has led to the discovery of numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to this familiar exponential localization, we report a distinct phenomenon--the algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect--which arises generically in non-Hermitian systems with two or more spatial dimensions. In such cases, the amplitude of skin modes typically decays from the boundary following a power law, rather than an exponential form--a behavior not captured by existing theoretical frameworks. To bridge this gap and describe the transition in localization from one to higher dimensions, we develop a generalized Fermi surface framework applicable to open-boundary systems in arbitrary dimensions. This framework not only reproduces known results for the exponential skin effect in 1D, but also predicts a new class of skin effects with algebraic decay in 2D and above. We demonstrate this framework in both tight-binding and continuum models in two and three dimensions. This investigation not only unveils a novel category of the non-Hermitian skin effect but also offers a comprehensive theoretical structure that describes skin effects in any non-Hermitian system, irrespective of its spatial dimensionality.</p>

A Fermi surface spin texture with parallel spin-momentum locking in these material has been observed by a recent experiment [Nat. Comm. 15,3720(2024)]. We find that the Weyl nodes location and the Fermi surface spin texture lead to gapped zero-momenta intranode superconductivity (SC), which is absent in achiral Weyl semimetals. Through self-consistent mean-field calculations, we find that a cubic lattice system in general favors a mixture of spin-singlet $s_\pm$ and $d+id$-wave pairings. In the presence of only the $s_\pm$-wave pairing, we identify a first-order time-reversal invariant topological SC phase. Notably, an SC phase with two Majorana cones for opened Fermi surfaces is energetically favorable. In addition, a second-order topological superconductor with chiral Majorana states can be realized in the presence of a mixture of $s\pm$- and $d+id$-wave pairing. We show that chiral topological semimetals in cubic lattice are fascinating platforms for exploring intrinsic unconventional superconductivity and topological superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers with Plasma oscillation phase-matching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emil Rizvanov, Samuel Kern, Pavol Neilinger, Miroslav Grajcar</p>
            <p>High gain and large bandwidth of traveling-wave parametric amplifier exploiting the nonlinearity of Josephson Junctions can be achieved by fulfilling the so-called phase-matching condition. This condition is usually addressed by placing resonant structures along the waveguide or by periodic modulations of its parameters, creating gaps in the waveguide's dispersion. Here, we propose to employ the Josephson junctions, which constitute the centerline of the amplifier, as resonant elements for phase matching. By numerical simulations in JoSIM (and WRspice) software, we show that Josephson plasma oscillations can be utilized to create wavevector mismatch sufficient for phase matching as well as to prevent the conversion of the pump energy to higher harmonics. The proposed TWPA design has a gain of 15 dB and a 3.5 GHz bandwidth, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art TWPAs.</p>

            <h2>Spin Seebeck effect of interacting spinons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ren-Bo Wang, Naveen Nishad, Anna Keselman, Leon Balents, Oleg A. Starykh</p>
            <p>We present the theory of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect between a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain and a conductor. The effect consists of the generation of a spin current across the spin chain-conductor interface in response to the temperature difference between the two systems. In this setup, the current is given by the convolution of the local spin susceptibilities of the spin chain and the conductor. We find the spin current to be fully controlled, both in the magnitude and the sign, by the backscattering interaction between spinons, fractionalized spin excitations of the Heisenberg chain. In particular, it vanishes when the spinons form a non-interacting spinon gas. Our analytical results for the local spin susceptibility at the open end of the spin chain are in excellent agreement with numerical DMRG simulations.</p>

            <p>We introduce "stochastic cloaking," where a region of space is concealed from an ensemble of diffusing particles whose individual trajectories are governed by a stochastic (Langevin) equation. Our simulations reveal how different interpretations of the Langevin equation affect the cloaking performance of an annular single-layer invisibility cloak of smoothly varying diffusivity in two dimensions. Near-perfect cloaking is achieved under the Ito convention, indicated by the cloak preventing particles from accessing an inner core without disturbing the particle density outside the cloak. The cloak's performance can be further improved by regularising its singular behaviour. We believe our demonstration of stochastic cloaking is a significant milestone, comparable to earlier developments that extended cloaking from optics and acoustics to thermodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kanav Sharma, Ritam Banerjee, Anuvab Nandi, Radha Krishna Gopal, Chiranjib Mitra</p>
            <p>This study investigates the influence of indium doping on the defect states in (Bi0.3Sb0.7)2Te3 (BST) ternary topological insulators. Thin (10 nm) and thick (60 nm) films of pristine BST and indium-doped BST (In0.14(Bi0.3Sb0.7)1.86Te3) were synthesized using pulsed laser deposition. The electronic properties were characterized through low-frequency noise spectroscopy and temperature-dependent resistance (R-T) measurements. For the 10 nm films, R-T analysis revealed that indium doping shifts the thermal activation energy by approximately 100 meV. This doping also suppresses a shallow impurity band at 72 meV, a finding corroborated by 1/f noise measurements. In the 60 nm films, noise spectroscopy was used to probe deep defect states, where indium doping was found to increase the activation energy from 292.3 meV to 392 meV -- a consistent shift of 100 meV. These findings demonstrate that indium doping is an effective method for systematically modifying both shallow and deep defect states, enhancing the insulating properties and offering a mechanism to engineer the electronic behavior of topological insulators for advanced electronic applications where noise reduction is crucial.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Mao, Juan Felipe Mendez-Valderrama, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Inspired by the discovery of a variety of correlated insulators in the moiré universe, controlled by interactions projected to a set of isolated bands with a narrow bandwidth, we examine here a partial sum-rule associated with the inverse frequency-weighted optical conductivity restricted to low-energies. Unlike standard sum-rules that extend out to $infinite$ frequencies, which include contributions from $all$ inter-band transitions, we focus here on transitions associated $only$ with the $projected$ degrees of freedom. We analyze the partial sum-rule in a non-perturbative but "solvable" limit for a variety of correlation-induced insulators. This includes (i) magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene at integer-filling with projected Coulomb interactions, starting from the chiral flat-band limit and including realistic perturbations, (ii) fractional fillings of Chern-bands which support generalized Laughlin-like states, starting from a Landau-level and including a periodic potential and magnetic-field, respectively, drawing connections to twisted MoTe$_2$, and (iii) integer filling in toy-models of non-topological flat-bands with a tunable quantum geometry in the presence of repulsive interactions. The partial sum-rule in all of these examples is implicitly constrained by the form of the band quantum geometry via the low-lying excitation spectrum, but is not related to it explicitly. For interacting Slater-determinant insulators, the partial sum-rule is related to a new quantity -- "many-body projected quantum geometry" -- obtained from the interaction-renormalized electronic bands. We also point out an intriguing connection between the partial sum-rule and the quantum Fisher information associated with the projected many-body position operator.</p>

            <h2>Unified percolation scenario for the $α$ and $β$ processes in simple glass formers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Gao, Hai-Bin Yu, Thomas B. Schrøder, Jeppe C. Dyre</p>
            <p>Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. Here, we numerically investigate a double-percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses, the so-called alpha and beta relaxations. For several simple glass formers, we find that when monitoring the dynamic shear modulus as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the alpha process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass state, the mobile-particle percolation transition pinpoints a beta process whenever the latter is well separated from the main (alpha) process. For two-dimensional systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no beta relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest that a general description of glassy dynamics should be based on a percolation perspective.</p>

            <h2>Tuning the band topology and topological Hall effect in skyrmion crystals via the spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arijit Mandal, S. Satpathy, B.R.K. Nanda</p>
            <p>The topological Hall effect is the result of spin-asymmetric deflection of charge carriers flowing through a non-collinear spin system. Effective manipulation of the topological Hall conductivity (THC) in skyrmions is currently a vigorous area of research with an eye towards potential spintronics application. Here, we show that the band topology and the THC in a skyrmion crystal can be tuned by changing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be accomplished via a perpendicular electric field. This results in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between ordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For partially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its sign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba strength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We extend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show that they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to similar results. Our work opens up the scope to go beyond the existing avenues for the control of charge transport in skyrmion crystals.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Temperature Induced Transition and Convergence of Thermal Conductivity in Germanene Monolayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sapta Sindhu Paul Chowdhury, Sourav Thapliyal, Santosh Mogurampelly</p>
            <p>We report an anomalous temperature-induced transition in thermal conductivity in germanene monolayer around a critical temperature $T_c = 350 \, \text{K}$. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveal a transition from $\kappa \sim T^{-2}$ scaling below $T_c$ to $\kappa \sim T^{-1/2}$ above, contrasting with conventional $\kappa \sim T^{-1}$ behavior. This anomalous scaling correlates with the long-scale characteristic timescale $\tau_2$ obtained from double exponential fitting of the heat current autocorrelation function. Phonon mode analysis using normal mode decomposition indicates that a redshift in ZO phonons reduces the acoustic-optical phonon gap, causing an overlap, enhances the phonon-phonon scattering, driving the anomalous scaling behavior. Moreover, nonequilibrium simulations find a convergent thermal conductivity of germanene with sample size, in agreement with mode coupling theory, owing to the high scattering of ZA phonons due to the inherent buckling of germanene.</p>

            <p>Oxyhydrides represent a new class of functional materials, yet the synthesis of dense polycrystals or single-crystals suitable for transport studies remains a significant challenge due to hydrogen desorption at elevated temperatures. The co-diffusion of oxygen and hydrogen in densely sintered BaTiO3 enables the topochemical formation of millimeter-scale bulk BaTiO3-xHx via high-pressure diffusion control (HPDC). Hydride ions selectively occupy oxygen-deficient sites, as confirmed by neutron diffraction, TPD, TG, and NMR. Systematic tuning of the hydrogen content and precise control of the electronic conductivity were achieved via HPDC. Hydrogen desorption analysis reveals distinct bonding states between near-surface and interior-bulk regions, which significantly affect the oxynitride conversion under N2 flow. Importantly, the diffusion-based nature of HPDC allows direct anion conversion even in single-crystalline oxides, as demonstrated by the synthesis of SrTiO3-xHx single crystals. These results establish HPDC as a general platform for accessing dense, metastable oxyhydrides with tunable anionic composition and transport properties.</p>

            <h2>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</h2>

            <p>A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net charge carriers emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the transport variables in hydrodynamic domain. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature and Lorenz number $L_{0}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{e}\right)^{2}$. The validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law can be checked by evaluating the Lorenz ratio, which is expected to be unity. We investigate the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law by examining whether the Lorenz ratio equals unity or deviates from it. Our findings indicate that, within the fluid-based framework, the Lorenz ratio consistently leads to a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. This is attributed to the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per net charge carriers in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene and quark-gluon plasma, both systems at a low net carrier density, violate the Wiedemann-Franz law due to their fluidic nature. However, graphene at a relatively high net carrier density obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or electron density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high carrier density. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of quark-gluon plasma at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic Matter and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility experiments.</p>

            <p>We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a nontrivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a nontrivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topological jump originating from the Euler class in the presence of $d$-wave superconducting pairings, and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the noninteracting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced nonlinear currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaobo Zhou, Sangeeta Sharma, John Kay Dewhurst, Junjie He</p>
            <p>Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave compensated altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This metastable magnetization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. We identify the underlying mechanism as an anisotropic optical-induced intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) effect, originating from the momentum-dependent spin splitting unique to altermagnets. This a-OISTR effect enables the polarization of light to drive direction-selective transient spin-dependent currents between sublattices, leading to a controllable ultrafast magnetic state transition in AM. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferrimagnetic state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Kühn, Yangyiwei Yang, Guanyu Chen, Shanelle N. Foster, Herbert Egger, Bai-Xiang Xu</p>
            <p>Improving efficiency of electrical machines requires fundamental knowledge on the mechanisms behind magnetic and eddy current losses of the magnetic core materials, with Fe-Si alloy as a prototype. These losses are intrinsically influenced by the microstructure of the materials. This necessitates physics-based, microstructure-informed multiscale simulations. In the present paper, we utilised micromagnetic simulations and computational homogenization methods to calculate the effective hysteresis and effective conductivities of Fe-Si electrical steels. To demonstrate the methodology, binder-jet printed electrical steel material samples with different microstructure were investigated. The microstructure samples were digitized based on both the descriptor-based synthetic reconstruction and SEM-image-based digitization. More samples were generated with varying microstructure features such as grain size and grain boundary phases. The micromagnetic simulations were then performed to investigate the magnetic hysteresis and hysteresis loss. The eddy current loss was also evaluated by using the effective conductivity through computational homogenization. By performing parameter research on a series of synthetic microstructures, effects of average grain size and grain boundary (GB) phase thickness on the hysteresis loss and eddy current loss were unveiled. An average grain size around 120 \si{\micro m} has the lowest hysteresis loss, although the eddy current loss increases with the grain size. Increasing GB-phase thickness helps reduce both losses. Results indicate the potential to decrease loss of magnetic core materials by microstructure optimization.</p>

            <p>Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. While conventional conformal field theory is associated with positive central charges, nonunitary conformal field theory with complex-valued central charges has recently been recognized as physically relevant. Here, we demonstrate that complex-valued entanglement entropy characterizes complex conformal field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many-body systems. This is based on non-Hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states. Applying the density matrix renormalization group to non-Hermitian systems, we numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model, thereby confirming the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theory.</p>

We provide insights on the origin of such differences by a comparative analysis of the electronic structure.

            <p>Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD, which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the magnetism of pyrochlore oxides, we consider the effect of quantum fluctuations in the most general symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor Kramers exchange Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice. At the classical level, this Hamiltonian exhibits a rich landscape of classical spin liquids and a variety of nonconventional magnetic phases. In contrast, much remains unclear for the quantum model, where quantum fluctuations have the potential to alter the classical landscape and stabilize novel magnetic phases. Employing state-of-the-art pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group calculations for the spin-$1/2$ model, we determine the quantum phase diagram at relevant cross-sections, where the classical model hosts an algebraic nodal rank-2 spin liquid and a spin nematic order. We find large regions in parameter space on which dipolar magnetic order is absent and, based on known fingerprints in the correlation functions, we suggest that this nonconventional region is composed of an ensemble of distinct phases stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Our results hint at the existence of a spin nematic phase, and we identify the quantum analog of the classical rank-2 spin liquid. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of assessing the subtle interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in reconciling the experimental findings on the nature of magnetic order in Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <p>Phonon interactions from lattice anharmonicity govern thermal properties and heat transport in materials. These interactions are described by n-th order interatomic force constants (n-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of n atoms, or equivalently encoding n-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress n-IFCs for arbitrary order n. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of n-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed n-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with >98% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, TiNiSn and monoclinic ZrO$_2$). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.</p>

We show how the pressure anisotropy can be used to clearly define the bulk and interface regions and extract a genuine shear-rate dependent surface tension.

This effect can occur not only in itinerant electron systems but also in localized electron systems that emerge due to electronic correlations. In such systems, elementary excitations behaving as bosons govern spin transport, and magnetic interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling can induce a topologically nontrivial band structure. However, such magnetic interactions can potentially break spin conservation, thereby preventing conventional spin currents from being conserved. In this study, starting from a general localized electron model, we formulate the spin Nernst effect in terms of a conserved spin current that remains applicable even in spin-nonconserving systems. To address the torque term appearing in the conserved spin current, we adopt semiclassical theory and derive an expression for the spin Nernst coefficient for bosonic systems. This coefficient consists of two terms originating from the Berry curvature and the quantum metric, which are distinctly different from the spin Berry curvature obtained in an approach that neglects the torque term. We apply our framework to two specific quantum spin models, the Kitaev-Heisenberg and Shastry-Sutherland models, and calculate the temperature dependence of the spin Nernst coefficient. We find that this quantity significantly differs from that obtained by neglecting the torque term in both models. Furthermore, we clarify that the impact of the torque term on the spin Nernst effect strongly depends on the model parameters, suggesting that our formulation based on the conserved spin current is essential for understanding this effect in insulating magnets.</p>

            <h2>Atomic Altermagnetism</h2>

            <p>Altermagnetism has been recently experimentally verified by photoemission mapping of the spin order in momentum space in MnTe and CrSb, which feature two anisotropic sublattices with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the presence of an even-parity ferroically ordered non-dipolar spin density on the atomic sites, i.e. atomic altermagnetism, in MnTe, $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$. We do so through spin-symmetry analysis and partial-wave decomposition of the spin density obtained by first-principles calculations. In MnTe we show a ferroically ordered g-wave form factor in the spin density around the Mn site. In the $A_2O_3M_2Se_2$ family (A= La, Sr and M= Mn, Fe, Co), we show that there is a ferroically ordered d-wave form factor coexisting with the antiferroic magnetic dipoles in the M site, while the O site shows no dipole but a pure d-wave atomic spin density. In the Mott-insulating candidate $Ba_2CaOsO_6$, as a key result, we reveal a pure form of atomic altermagnetism - absent of any dipolar sublattice order. This highlights that the altermagnetic order can exist without a Néel vector formed by antiferroic dipole moments on an even number of crystal sublattices, underlining its distinction from collinear Néel antiferromagnetic order. Our calculations predict that $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$ can exhibit giant spin-splitter angles of up to 42° and 26° respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of large altermagnetic responses without requiring the staggered Néel order of local dipole moments.</p>

            <h2>Impact of structural distortions on the correlated electronic structure of orbital-selective Mott insulating Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ under strains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nam Nguyen, Alex Taekyung Lee, Anh T. Ngo, Hyowon Park</p>
            <p>Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</p>

            <p>Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content, widely employed in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Injectable, depot-forming hydrogels enable sustained release of therapeutic agents by modulating macromolecular diffusion through dynamic polymer networks. However, achieving reliable control over release kinetics remains a challenge, as the injection process induces shear-mediated disruption of transient crosslinks, leading to an initial burst release that can cause local toxicity and compromise therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy designed to restore network structure post-injection through rapid reformation of dynamic crosslinks, enabling time-dependent regulation of diffusion properties. By tuning viscoelastic parameters, including stress relaxation time and network recovery rate, we reduced the extent of burst release without compromising sustained delivery. Using model protein cargo, we demonstrate in both $in~vitro$ and $in~vivo$ settings that hydrogels with faster crosslink reformation kinetics exhibit significantly lower early-phase release while maintaining long-term delivery comparable to unmodified formulations. These results establish a mechanistic framework for decoupling short- and long-term release behavior, offering a broadly applicable strategy for precise drug delivery in soft tissue environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdourahman Khaireh-Walieh, Alexandre Arnoult, Sébastien Plissard, Peter R. Wiecha</p>
            <p>Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate, and potentially real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.</p>

            <h2>Exchangeless braiding of Majorana zero modes in weakly coupled Kitaev chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Quade, Michael Potthoff</p>
            <p>Exchangeless braiding of Majorana modes is studied in minimal networks of weakly hybridized Kitaev chains of finite length using a rigorous many-body framework. In particular, for two coupled chains it is shown that exchangeless braiding is achieved by $2\pi$ rotations of the phase $\phi$ of the superconducting order parameter of one of the chains. This braiding protocol is verified by the numerical calculation of the non-Abelian Wilczek-Zee phase of the low-energy many-body subspaces ${\cal H}_{0}(\phi)$ based on the Bertsch-Robledo ground-state overlap formula. In the parameter space spanned by the total chain length, the strength of the weak hybridization connecting the chains, and the on-site potential, we identify two regions with different braiding outcomes, i.e., a projective $\sigma_{x}$-gate and a projective $\sigma_{z}$-gate phase. The transition between these phases is a continuous crossover, the location of which is reliably given by a simple four-Majorana mode model. This demonstrates the resilience of the anyonic properties of the Majorana modes against finite-size effects and weak links between Kitaev chains.</p>

            <h2>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D: ground state and real-time dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yantao Wu, Wen-Yuan Liu</p>
            <p>We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D for both ground state and real-time dynamics. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which already simplifies existing algorithms for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining with variational Monte Carlo (VMC), enabling efficient computations for (2+1)D LGTs. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate ground state simulation of pure $Z_2$, $Z_3$ and $Z_4$ gauge theory, odd-$Z_2$ gauge theories, and $Z_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32 \times 32$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it allows for accurate simulations of real-time dynamics up to long-time, exemplified by the dynamics of elementary excitations of the deconfined $Z_2$ gauge field on a $10\times10$ lattice. This is also the first example of using VMC to simulate the real-time dynamics of PEPS, whose impact may extend beyond gauge theory.</p>

            <p>Atomic-resolution imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing the nanoscale structure of materials, in particular features such as defects, local strains, and symmetry-breaking distortions. In addition to advanced instrumentation, the effectiveness of the technique depends on computational image analysis to extract meaningful features from complex datasets recorded in experiments, which can be complicated by the presence of noise and artifacts, small or overlapping features, and the need to scale analysis over large representative areas. Here, we present image analysis approaches which synergize real and reciprocal space information to efficiently and reliably obtain meaningful structural information with picometer scale precision across hundreds of nanometers of material from atomic-resolution electron microscope images. Damping superstructure peaks in reciprocal space allows symmetry-breaking structural distortions to be disentangled from other sources of inhomogeneity and measured with high precision. Real space fitting of the wave-like signals resulting from Fourier filtering enables absolute quantification of lattice parameter variations and strain, as well as the uncertainty associated with these measurements. Implementations of these algorithms are made available as an open source Python package.</p>

Numerical results demonstrate that extended, critical, and localized states can be distinguished via their phase-space representations, particularly the Wigner distribution. The associated Wigner entropy, derived from this distribution, peaks at the critical state, enabling precise localization of the mobility edge.

            <p>Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and >1{\mu}m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation. Our results develop the mesoscopic understanding of Si/SiGe heterostructures necessary for scalable device design.</p>

            <h2>Persistent Homology-Based Indicator of Orientational Ordering in Two-Dimensional Quasi-Particle Systems applied to Skyrmion Lattices</h2>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) quasi-particle systems, such as magnetic skyrmions, exhibit topological phase transitions between unique 2D phases. However, to identify the phases, an easy and computationally low-cost methodology for capturing the configurational properties of lattice ordering and constructing such an appropriate descriptor that can be easily calculated is, though, not obvious. Here, we propose an indicator for topological phase transitions using persistent homology (PH). PH offers novel insights beyond conventional indicators by capturing topological features derived from the configurational properties of the lattice. The proposed persistent-homology-based topological indicator, which selectively counts stable features in a persistence diagram, effectively traces the lattice's topological changes, as confirmed by comparisons with the conventionally used measure of the ordering (the magnitude of the orientational order parameter $\langle|\Psi_6|\rangle$), typically used to identify lattice phases. We demonstrate the applicability of our indicator to experimental data, showing that it yields results consistent with those of simulations. This experimental validation highlights the robustness of the proposed method for real physical systems beyond idealized simulated systems. While our method is demonstrated in the context of skyrmion lattice systems, the approach is general and can be extended to other two-dimensional systems composed of interacting quasi-particles. As a key advantage, our indicator offers lower computational complexity than the conventionally used measures.</p>

            <p>The thermal Hall conductivity of the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) - the superconductor with the highest critical temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure - was measured at temperatures down to 2 K for three dopings in the underdoped regime ($p$ = 0.09, 0.10, 0.11). By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior theoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 / \ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \ell$ grows as $T^3$, in agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave superconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer mercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the mean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered counterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation is be attributed to the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more pristine inner plane. We also report data in an ultraclean crystal of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) with full oxygen content $p$ = 0.18, believed to be the cleanest of any cuprate, and find that $\ell$ is not longer than in Hg1223.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Wang, Jonas Berx</p>
            <p>Efficient mixing of fluids is essential in many practical applications to achieve homogeneity. For microscopic systems, however, both diffusion and turbulence are ineffective methods to achieve chaotic mixing due to the low Reynolds number, hence either active stirring or inducing turbulence through geometric boundary effects are generally implemented. Here, we study a modified chiral Vicsek model, where active microswimmers act as moving rods, stirring the surrounding substrate. We study the degree of mixing in the patterns formed by interplay between confinement, chiral motion and alignment interactions. This mixing is computed by considering the entanglement of spacetime trajectories of the particles, which forms a braid. Optimising the finite-time braiding exponent of this braid then yields a set of constituent parameters of the system, showing that a pattern consisting of a local stable vortex droplet and an ordered oscillating phase achieves the highest degree of mixing.</p>

            <p>Fundamentally understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport behavior in liquid-like, partially occupied compounds remains a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we investigate the microscopic mechanisms underlying the ultralow thermal conductivity in ordered/liquid-like Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ by combining experimental methods with first-principles calculations. We first experimentally synthesize and characterize the ordered structure and liquid-like, partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with increasing temperature. We then combine self-consistent phonon calculations, including bubble-diagram corrections, with the Wigner transport equation, considering both phonon propagation and diffuson contributions, to evaluate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal conductivity in phase-change Cu$_3$BiS$_3$. Our theoretical model predicts an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.34 W/m/K at 400 K, dominated by diffuson contributions, which accurately reproduces and explains the experimental data. Importantly, the machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations not only reproduced the partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with the space group $\mathrm{P2_12_12_1}$ but also successfully replicated the thermal conductivity obtained from experiments and Wigner transport calculations. This observation highlights the negligible impact of ionic mobility arising from partially occupied Cu sites on the thermal conductivity in diffuson-dominated thermal transport compounds. Our work not only sheds light on the minimal impact of ionic mobility on ultralow thermal conductivity in phase-change materials but also demonstrates that the Wigner transport equation accurately describes thermal transport behavior in partially occupied phases with diffuson-dominant thermal transport.</p>

            <p>Noncollinear antiferromagnets offer much promise for antiferromagnetic spintronics and neuromorphic applications with a plethora of functional properties surpassing many competing magnetic systems. Films grown on mismatched substrates may relieve strain by the creation of slip-plane defects that strongly manipulate global physical properties important for application. This work demonstrates that a post growth annealing strategy results in near-defect-free, structurally robust films that reveal the underlying thermal evolution of the magnetic order symmetry. Beyond a critical film thickness, the spin structure transitions between two right-handed irreducible chiral representations via left-handed chiral ordering producing a striking change in the sign and angular dependence of the Anomalous Hall coefficient. The previously established mechanism of spin rotations in the (111) plane cannot fully explain the transition in applied magnetic field, and using a macrospin model this work finds that rotations along the chirality-inverting [1-10] direction are energetically preferable under certain conditions. These observations suggest that both left-handed and right-handed chiral order can be accessed in a single system, opening new routes to engineer devices by controlled switching of magnetic chirality allowing selection of associated functional properties as governed by symmetry.</p>

            <p>2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as promising materials for spintronic applications due to their unique magnetic properties and tunability. Controlling ferromagnetism via external stimuli is critical for both fundamental research and device integration. In particular, modulation of magnetic anisotropy and exchange interactions through strain offers a viable pathway for functional control. Owing to their weak interlayer coupling, vdW ferromagnets exhibit pronounced sensitivity to strain, enabling effective tuning of their magnetic states. In this study, electric-field-induced magnetoelectric coupling is investigated in the above-room-temperature vdW ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ integrated on a ferroelectric PMN-PT substrate. It is demonstrated that application of an electric field leads to a substantial reduction in coercive force along with dynamic reconfiguration of the magnetic domain structure. These effects are attributed to electric-field-induced modulation of the vdW interlayer gap and enhancement of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These findings reveal a strong interplay between electric fields and magnetism in vdW systems, offering a viable route toward the development of low-power, multifunctional magnetic devices. This work establishes a foundation for the electric-field control of magnetic properties in vdW ferromagnets and highlights their potential in next-generation spintronic technologies.</p>

            <p>We investigate strain-induced contributions to the transient polar magneto-optical Kerr effect response in laser-excited terfenol. The tr-MOKE signals obtained from TbFe$_{2}$ films with and without glass capping exhibit distinct signatures associated with transient strain. We experimentally observe the arrival of strain pulses via the reflectivity change. The tr-MOKE response measured without changing the pump-probe geometry is delayed by several picoseconds. This suggests a genuine magnetization response as opposed to instantaneous changes of optical constants as the origin of the signal. We model the propagation of longitudinal acoustic picosecond strain pulses and incorporate the inverse magnetostriction effect via a magnetoelastic term in the effective field of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with large damping. This reproduces not only the delay of the pulsed response, but also unveils the dominant contribution of quasi-static strain to the magnetization dynamics due to the thermal expansion in the optically probed near-surface region. Our experiments exemplify that purely longitudinal strain along the out-of-plane direction of the thin film enables efficient magnetoelastic coupling via the shear strain components arising in the oblique crystallographic frame of reference.</p>

In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying phase transitions in complex lattice models.</p>

            <p>We investigate the thermoelectric performance of 2D nanojunctions with gate tunable architectures and varying channel lengths from 3 to 12 nm using a combination of first principles simulations, including density functional theory, DFT with nonequilibrium Greens function formalism (nanoDCAL), and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our study reveals a gate, temperature, and length dependent transition from quantum to classical in electron transport, transitioning from quantum tunneling in short junctions to thermionic emission in longer ones. We observe nontrivial dependencies of the thermoelectric figure of merit on the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivities, and thermal conductivities as a result of this crossover and gate controlling. We identify that maximizing ZT requires tuning the chemical potential just outside the band gap, where the system lies at the transition between insulating and conducting regimes. While extremely large Seebeck coefficients are observed in the insulating state, they do not yield high ZT due to suppressed electrical conductivity and dominant phononic thermal transport. The optimal ZT larger than 2.3 is achieved in the shortest 3 nm junction at 500 K, where quantum tunneling and thermionic emission coexist. These findings offer fundamental insights into transport mechanisms in 2D semiconducting nanojunctions and present design principles for high efficiency nanoscale thermoelectric devices.</p>

            <p>Valley polarization and altermagnetism are two emerging fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics, offering unprecedented opportunites for information encoding and processing in novel energy-efficient devices. By coupling valley and spin degrees of freedom with ferroic orders such as ferroelectricity, nonvolatile memory functionalities can be achieved. Here, we propose a way to realize ferroelectric-valley (FE-valley) and FE-altermagnetic coupling in a bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) honeycomb lattices based on an effective four-band spin-full $k\cdot p$ model. Our proposal is validated in bilayer MnPTe$_3$ through first-principles calculations. A spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization occurs in AB- (BA-) stacking configuration, which is reversibly switchable via interlayer sliding. Remarkably, polarization reversal simultaneously inverts both layer-resolved valley polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. This dual control enables tunable layer-spin-locked anomalous valley Hall effects and an unprecedented magnetoelectric response in 2D antiferromagnets. Our work establishes a general paradigm for electrically programmable valleytronic and spintronic functionalities of 2D AFM materials.</p>

            <h2>A Hierarchy of Topological and Superconducting States in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</h2>

            <p>Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new frontier in condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuna Oikawa, Guillaume Deffrennes, Taichi Abe, Ryo Tamura, Koji Tsuda</p>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are general-purpose tools with wide-ranging applications, including in materials science. In this work, we introduce aLLoyM, a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained on alloy compositions, temperatures, and their corresponding phase information. To develop aLLoyM, we curated question-and-answer (Q&A) pairs for binary and ternary phase diagrams using the open-source Computational Phase Diagram Database (CPDDB) and assessments based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). We fine-tuned Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&A formats: multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials systems. To promote further research and adoption, we have publicly released the short-answer fine-tuned version of aLLoyM, along with the complete benchmarking Q&A dataset, on Hugging Face.</p>

            <h2>Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of charged solid-liquid interfaces with different water models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahdi Tavakol, Kislon Voïtchovsky</p>
            <p>Aqueous solid-liquid interfaces (SLI) are ubiquitous in nature and technology, often hosting molecular-level processes with macroscopic consequences. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a tool of choice to investigate interfacial phenomena with atomistic precision, but there exists a large number of water models, each optimised for a different purpose. Here we compare the ability of common water models to accurately simulate the interface between a charged silica surface and an aqueous solution containing NaCl. We first compare the bulk dielectric constant of water and its dependence on salt concentration for SPC/Fw, SPC/e, TIPS3p, H2O/DC, TIP3P-Fw, OPC3, TIP3P, TIP3P-FB, TIP3P-ST, FBA/e, and TIPS3p-PPPM, revealing large variations between models. Simulating the interface with silica for the most suitable water models (SPC/Fw, H2O/DC, TIP3-ST and TIPS3p-PPPM) show some intrinsic consistency with continuum predictions (Poisson-Boltzmann) whereby the free energy minima obtained from MD and the analytical model are in agreement, provided the latter includes the MD-determined total charge of ions in the Stern layer and dielectric constant. This consistency stands even for water models with a dielectric constant off by 100%. For salt concentrations higher than 0.21 M NaCl, the formation of random ion-ion pairs limits the reproducibility of the MD results and the applicability of the analytical method. The results highlight the applicability of the analytical model down to the nanoscale, provided a priory knowledge of the Stern layer charge is available. The findings could have significant implications for MD simulations of SLIs, especially at charged or electrified interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Spin Hall Effect with Extended Topologically Protected Features in Altermangetic Multilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Chen, Fangyang Zhan, Zheng Qin, Da-Shuai Ma, Dong-Hui Xu, Rui Wang</p>
            <p>Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states. Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.</p>

            <h2>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng-Tai Lee, Tom C. Lubensky, Tomer Markovich</p>
            <p>Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</p>

            <h2>Localization structure of electronic states in the quantum Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alioune Seye, Marcel Filoche</p>
            <p>We investigate the localization of electronic states in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By studying a continuum Schrödinger model with disordered electrostatic potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Lieb Materials: Altermagnetism and More</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Hao Chang, Igor I. Mazin, Kirill D. Belashchenko</p>
            <p>The Lieb lattice, originally proposed for cuprate superconductors, has gained new attention in the emerging field of altermagnetism as a minimal analytical model for the latter. While initially the so-called inverse Lieb lattice (ILL) was deemed only a theoretical model, recently several real materials with this crystallographic motif have been found. The unique geometry of ILL can accommodate complex magnetic orderings arising from competing exchange interactions and geometric frustration, offering great tunability for magnetic properties. In this work, we provide comprehensive insights into magnetic phases in ILL materials and establish guidelines for efficient identification of altermagnetic materials within this family. We begin by constructing phase diagrams using a simple Heisenberg model to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying altermagnetism and other complex magnetic phases observed experimentally. To bridge theory with experiment, we systematically investigate a series of existing ILL compounds using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine their magnetic ground states. Our computational results are in good agreement with experimental observations. Importantly, we identify a trend linking magnetic ordering to the $d$-shell filling of transition metal ions, with $d^{2-3}$ and $d^{5}$ configurations showing propensity for altermagnetic behavior. Additionally, we identify a promising metallic compound Sr$_{2}$CrO$_{2}$Cr$_{2}$OAs$_{2}$ as an altermagnet that is highly anisotropic in its $J_2$ exchange couplings with large Néel temperature ($\sim 600$ K). Using exchange coupling parameters extracted from DFT calculations, we compute the magnon spectra for altermagnetic systems. As expected, chiral splittings in the magnon dispersion are directly correlated with anisotropy between crystallographically inequivalent $J_{2}$ exchange interactions.</p>

            <h2>Double Helix of atomic displacements in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yihao Hu, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a "dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes, promising a route to giant electromechanical responses [\href{this https URL}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we unveil a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This intricate topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which mediates an emergent electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. This unique structure, conceptualized as a "self-Moiré" crystal, manifests two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the spiral's long-period potential fundamentally reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to an emergent multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a powerful, purely physical route to designing complex chiral order and provides a unified platform where structural topology, giant electromechanical coupling, and multi-valley electronics are intrinsically linked.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transport of spin angular momentum and linear momentum carried by magnons in electrically insulating collinear antiferromagnets (AFs). Focusing on both transverse and longitudinal geometries, we model magnons as a viscous fluid and explore the hydrodynamic transport regime that emerges when the magnon-magnon scattering length is shorter than the momentum-relaxation length, such that momentum-conserving processes dominate over momentum-relaxing ones. We develop a theoretical framework to investigate viscous effects in the magnon hydrodynamic regime, which give rise to measurable transport signatures such as nonlocal resistance and spin and thermal conductance. Accounting for both momentum and spin relaxations, we derive hydrodynamic equations governing magnon momentum and spin transport. Notably, interspecies scattering between antiferromagnetic magnons with opposite spin angular momentum induces drag-like effects that strongly modify spin current propagation. We derive expressions for magnon conductivity and introduce an accessibility parameter quantifying intra-band momentum transfer. Our results establish antiferromagnetic insulators as a promising platform for observing magnon-fluid dynamics and exploring collective spin transport phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shinian Cheng, Lilliana Rey, Beibei Yao, Ivan Popov, Alexei P. Sokolov</p>
            <p>Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymeric materials containing associative covalent dynamic bonds that make them recyclable by design. However, the fundamental mechanisms controlling their viscoelastic properties remain poorly understood. Our detailed studies of relaxation dynamics and viscoelastic behavior of model vitrimers revealed that the density of dynamic covalent crosslinks has no influence on chain dynamics (beyond a weak change in the glass transition temperature), yet it strongly affects the linear viscoelasticity of vitrimers. Increasing the crosslink density induces a sol-gel transition consistent with predictions of classical gelation theory, demonstrating its applicability to vitrimers. Remarkably, the temperature-dependent analysis of the bond rearrangement time reveals an unexpectedly large negative activation entropy in the transition state that strongly slows down the bond exchange process despite its relatively low activation enthalpy. This insight explains the unusual long timescale for bond rearrangement in vitrimers and highlights the significance of entropy in controlling the viscoelasticity of dynamic covalent networks.</p>

            <h2>Analytical shortcuts to adiabaticity of weakly driven processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Nazé</p>
            <p>The analytical expression for shortcuts to adiabaticity for any switching time and any thermally isolated system performing a finite-time and weakly driven process is presented. It is based on the analytical solution of the optimal protocols of weak processes for open systems. The extension to adiabatic processes was made by employing the concept of waiting time. The shortcuts to adiabaticity are proven by showing that the excess power is null in all instants, indicating that no nonequilibrium excitation occurs along the driving. Two examples are solved to verify the validity of such shortcuts: the typical case of oscillatory relaxation function and the transverse-field quantum Ising chain. In this last case, it is shown that non-quenching process outperforms the quenching one by suppressing the non-equilibrium excitations until the critical point is not achieved.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zehuan Tang, Tingfeng Ma, Boyue Su, Qing Xia, Pengfei Kang, Bowei Wu</p>
            <p>When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observed anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated due to the implied symmetries between the two steady states. On the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition modes under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effect is no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.</p>

            <p>Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</p>

            <p>Quantum neural networks, parameterized quantum circuits optimized under a specific cost function, provide a paradigm for achieving near-term quantum advantage in quantum information processing. Understanding QNN training dynamics is crucial for optimizing their performance, however, the role of quantum data in training for supervised learning such as classification and regression remains unclear. We reveal a quantum-data-driven dynamical transition where the target values and data determine the convergence of the training. Through analytical classification over the fixed points of the dynamical equation, we reveal a comprehensive `phase diagram' featuring seven distinct dynamics originating from a bifurcation with multiple codimension. Perturbative analyses identify both exponential and polynomial convergence class. We provide a non-perturbative theory to explain the transition via generalized restricted Haar ensemble. The analytical results are confirmed with numerical simulations and experimentation on IBM quantum devices. Our findings provide guidance on constructing the cost function to accelerate convergence in QNN training.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Græns Larsen, Anne E. B. Nielsen, André Eckardt, Francesco Petiziol</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars are energy eigenstates which fail to reproduce thermal expectation values of local observables, in systems where the rest of the many-body spectrum fulfils eigenstate thermalization. Experimental observation of quantum many-body scars has so far been limited to models with multiple scar states evenly spaced in energy. It is thus an interesting question whether even single isolated scars, which theoretically embody the weakest possibile violation of eigenstate thermalization and may be thought to have no detectable impact in experiments, can leave a trace in measurable quantities. Moreover, single scars offer an interesting scenario for exploring the connection between quantum many-body scars and the original notion of scarring in quantum dynamical systems theory. Here we propose protocols to observe single scars in architectures of fixed-frequency, fixed-coupling superconducting qubits. We first adapt known models possessing the desired features into a form particularly suited for the experimental platform. We develop protocols for the implementation of these models, through trotterized sequences of two-qubit cross-resonance interactions, and verify the existence of the approximate scar state in the stroboscopic effective Hamiltonian. Since a single scar cannot be detected from coherent revivals in the dynamics, differently from towers of scar states, we propose and numerically investigate alternative and experimentally-accessible signatures. These include the dynamical response of the scar to local state deformations, to controlled noise, and to the resolution of the Lie-Suzuki-Trotter digitization.</p>

We show that simulations of these more realistic models of high-temperature superconductors require only an order of magnitude or so more Toffoli gates than a simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Furthermore, we find plenty classically difficult instances with Toffoli and qubit counts that far lower than commonly considered quantum phase estimation circuits for electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry.

            <p>The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</p>

However, existing tweezer platforms have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single strontium atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two dimensional arrays with more than 1000 trapped atoms, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or surpassing existing approaches. This is enabled by highly efficient holographic metasurfaces fabricated from high-refractive index materials, silicon-rich silicon nitride and titanium dioxide. Leveraging sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, our platform allows scaling far beyond current capabilities. As a demonstration, we realize an optical tweezer array with 360,000 traps. These advances will facilitate tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.</p>

            <p>The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</p>

We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry.

            <p>Two-photon interference from an InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dot (QD) emitting in the telecom C-band with a raw two-photon interference visibility of $V_{HOM}=(71.9\pm0.2)$ % is demonstrated. This is achieved by a two-fold approach: an improvement of the molecular beam epitaxial growth for better QDs, and integration of the QDs into an optical circular Bragg grating resonator for a Purcell enhancement of the radiative decay rate. The quantum optical properties of the fabricated device are studied by means of time-correlated single-photon counting under quasi-resonant excitation of the charged exciton line. A reduced lifetime of $T_1=(257.5\pm0.2)$ ps is found corresponding to a Purcell factor of $F_P\geqq(4.7\pm0.5)$. Pronounced anti-bunching of the second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay $g^{(2)} (0)=(0.0307\pm0.0004)$ confirms the single-photon emission character. The two-photon interference is demonstrated with an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer in Hong-Ou-Mandel configuration. We discuss strategies how to further improve the indistinguishability, and provide a survey of the state-of-the art.</p>

            <h2>Holographic Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations in Finite Density Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivam K. Sharma</p>
            <p>Using real-time holography, we investigate fluctuation-dissipation relations in holographic systems at finite density. In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of a charged scalar field against a charged black hole background, leading to an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordström black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at small but finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.</p>

            <h2>Detecting emergent 1-form symmetries with quantum error correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Jie Liu, Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-form symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.</p>

            <h2>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jhh-Jing Hong, Feng-Li Lin</p>
            <p>Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by coupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological type, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source couples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation theorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath system generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other two alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics.</p>

            <h2>Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover</p>
            <p>The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</p>

            <h2>Mesostructural origins of the anisotropic compressive properties of low-density closed-cell foams: A deeper understanding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Liu, F. Liu, D. Zenkert, M. Åkermo, M. Fagerström</p>
            <p>Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behaviour confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after buckling, followed by membrane yielding. Based on the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling strength and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructures of low-density closed-cell foams.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Gravelle, Cecilia M. S. Alvares, Jacob R. Gissinger, Axel Kohlmeyer</p>
            <p>The availability of open-source molecular simulation software packages allows scientists and engineers to focus on running and analyzing simulations without having to write, parallelize, and validate their own simulation software. While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol. In addition, we introduce LAMMPS-GUI, an enhanced cross-platform graphical text editor specifically designed for use with LAMMPS and able to run LAMMPS directly on the edited input. LAMMPS-GUI is used as the primary tool in the tutorials to edit inputs, run LAMMPS, extract data, and visualize the simulated systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peyman Fahimi, Andrew J. Irwin, Michael Lynch</p>
            <p>The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated in data postprocessing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We present a readout error-mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures, using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>We prove an upper bound on long-range distillable entanglement in $D$ spatial dimensions. Namely, it must decay faster than $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance between entangled regions. For states that are asymptotically rotationally invariant, the bound is strengthened to $1/r^D$. We then find explicit examples of quantum states with decay arbitrarily close to the bound. In one dimension, we construct free fermion Hamiltonians with nearest neighbor couplings that have these states as ground states. Curiously, states in conformal field theory are far from saturation, with distillable entanglement decaying faster than any polynomial.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgeny S. Asmolov, Elena F. Silkina, Olga I. Vinogradova</p>
            <p>The electro-hydrodynamics near conducting walls is revisited. Attention is focused on the impact of an explicit diffuse Stern layer, which permittivity and viscosity differ from the bulk values, on the velocity of an electro-osmotic plug flow. To solve this problem we propose an approach of mapping the flow in the Stern layer to the surface dividing the Stern and diffuse layer, where an effective electro-hydrodynamic slip boundary condition is imposed. The latter implies that an effective surface charge is responding to the applied field and characterized by a mobility parameter $\mu \geq 1$. We derive analytic equations for $\mu$ and demonstrate that it is determined only by electrostatic properties of the electric double layer. These equations are then used to calculate electrokinetic (zeta) potentials of surfaces. We show that the zeta potential generally exceeds the surface one, which implies an amplification of the electro-osmotic flow. This effect is most pronounced if the hydrodynamic slip length is large and/or in concentrated solutions.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle confined to a curved path from the dynamics of a two-dimensional curved thin-layer system incorporating spin connection contributions. We demonstrate that the geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion govern the emergent non-Abelian gauge potential, while the geodesic and Gaussian curvatures govern the effective scalar potential in the Hamiltonian. The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed with and without the adiabatic approximation. Under this approximation, the surface topology is linked to the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and to the pseudo-magnetic flux. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus non-geodesic propagation. Furthermore, the spin evolution along Viviani's curve exemplifies surface dependence. The curve's topology ensures closure of the spin direction and independence of the spin from the path direction. Our theory establishes a framework for spin-state manipulation via engineered nanostructured channels, enabling novel topological quantum control strategies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emad Chaparian</p>
            <p>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of flow when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</p>

            <h2>Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization for Complex Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenric P. Nelson</p>
            <p>The coupled entropy is proven to correct a flaw in the derivation of the Tsallis entropy and thereby solidify the theoretical foundations for analyzing the uncertainty of complex systems. The Tsallis entropy originated from considering power probabilities $p_i^q$ in which \textit{q} independent, identically-distributed random variables share the same state. The maximum entropy distribution was derived to be a \textit{q}-exponential, which is a member of the shape ($\kappa$), scale ($\sigma$) distributions. Unfortunately, the $q$-exponential parameters were treated as though valid substitutes for the shape and scale. This flaw causes a misinterpretation of the generalized temperature and an imprecise derivation of the generalized entropy. The coupled entropy is derived from the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) and the Student's t distribution, whose shape derives from nonlinear sources and scale derives from linear sources of uncertainty. The Tsallis entropy of the GPD converges to one as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$, which makes it too cold. The normalized Tsallis entropy (NTE) introduces a nonlinear term multiplying the scale and the coupling, making it too hot. The coupled entropy provides perfect balance, ranging from $\ln \sigma$ for $\kappa=0$ to $\sigma$ as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. One could say, the coupled entropy allows scientists, engineers, and analysts to eat their porridge, confident that its measure of uncertainty reflects the mathematical physics of the scale of non-exponential distributions while minimizing the dependence on the shape or nonlinear coupling. Examples of complex systems design including a coupled variation inference algorithm are reviewed.</p>

            <p>Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has become a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of thin films, offering direct access to the complex permittivity in the terahertz range. However, in transmission-based measurements of thin films on thick substrates, multiple reflections and limited time windows can introduce artifacts that obscure resonant features such as phonon modes. Time-domain windowing remains one of the most widely adopted strategies to mitigate these effects, yet systematic guidelines on its application remain scarce. In this work, we organize a practical routine for extracting the complex permittivity from THz-TDS data, focusing on when and how to apply time-domain windowing. The routine incorporates decision points for truncation versus smooth apodization, and emphasizes tailoring the window length and shape to specific signal conditions. We demonstrate the approach using representative measurements on PbTe thin films, highlighting cases in which truncation suffices, where apodization is essential, and how different window functions and lengths influence the resulting spectra. We also propose simple metrics to assess signal continuity and guide window selection. Although other analysis techniques exist, including parametric spectral estimation, this study focuses on formalizing windowing-based processing into an accessible experimental workflow. Our results show that the choice of window parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of extracted material parameters, particularly for sharply resonant systems. This work provides an accessible framework for improving spectral fidelity in THz-TDS of thin-film samples.</p>

            <p>The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</p>

            <p>Transmons are widely adopted in quantum computing architectures for their engineered insensitivity to charge noise and correspondingly long relaxation times. Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in dephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same device. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise. However, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of dephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations in the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While charge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to the charge offset and can affect $T_{\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement a protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which are interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in the same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both parities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even with $E_\text{J}/E_\text{C} \approx 50$. Consequently, parity flip rates must be considered as a device characterization metric.</p>

            <p>We study time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)-dimensional abelian bosonic topological phases. Z_2 x Z_2 classifies the time-reversal anomalies in such systems symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (3+1) dimensions and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as RP^4 and CP^2. These partition functions are related by an anomaly formula of the form Z(RP^4) * Z(CP^2) = theta_M, where theta_M is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state. Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges, denoted xi_n, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation Z(CP^2) = xi_1, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula involving both the higher central charges xi_n and a new time-reversal invariant eta_n. By introducing a distinguished subset M^n of the set A of anyons, we establish the relation eta_n * xi_n = (sum of theta(a)^n over a in M^n) divided by its absolute value. This generalizes the known anomaly formula. We analyze the algebraic structure of the subset M^n, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.</p>

            <p>The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.</p>

First, we map out the ground states and phase diagram of the system, identifying a range of density-wave-ordered phases,and find excellent agreement between theory and experiment. Allowing for local control of the detuning field thereafter, we discover a quantum analog of the classical liquid--vapor transition and probe its underlying hysteretic dynamics. Furthermore, we study out-of-equilibrium quantum quenches and observe anomalously slow relaxation dynamics arising from kinetic constraints. These results highlight how geometric control offered by neutral-atom simulators can extend the frontiers of programmable quantum matter, enabling access to complex phases, metastability, and thermalization dynamics in many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Hosting giant Rydberg excitons with principal quantum numbers up to n = 30, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) provides a rare solid-state setting for exploring Rydberg physics, as exemplified by the blockade effect. Here we access the strongly interaction regime at high excitation densities (10^14-10^16/cm^3) and resolve the corresponding blockade dynamics for n = 2-7 using time-resolved spectroscopy. We find that Rydberg blockades are primarily governed by resonant dipolar interactions and that exciton recombination is coupled to the blockade itself. These findings demonstrate the potential for manipulating Rydberg exctions in the strongly interacting blockade regime in a solid state system.</p>

            <h2>Unexpectedly large entropic barrier controls bond rearrangements in vitrimers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shinian Cheng, Lilliana Rey, Beibei Yao, Ivan Popov, Alexei P. Sokolov</p>
            <p>Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymeric materials containing associative covalent dynamic bonds that make them recyclable by design. However, the fundamental mechanisms controlling their viscoelastic properties remain poorly understood. Our detailed studies of relaxation dynamics and viscoelastic behavior of model vitrimers revealed that the density of dynamic covalent crosslinks has no influence on chain dynamics (beyond a weak change in the glass transition temperature), yet it strongly affects the linear viscoelasticity of vitrimers. Increasing the crosslink density induces a sol-gel transition consistent with predictions of classical gelation theory, demonstrating its applicability to vitrimers. Remarkably, the temperature-dependent analysis of the bond rearrangement time reveals an unexpectedly large negative activation entropy in the transition state that strongly slows down the bond exchange process despite its relatively low activation enthalpy. This insight explains the unusual long timescale for bond rearrangement in vitrimers and highlights the significance of entropy in controlling the viscoelasticity of dynamic covalent networks.</p>

            <p>Barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is a compelling material for integrated photonics due to its strong electro-optic and second-order nonlinear properties. Crystal Ion Slicing (CIS) presents a scalable and CMOS-compatible route for fabricating thin BaTiO$_3$ films; however, ion implantation during CIS introduces lattice damage that can degrade structural and optical performance. In this study, we demonstrate that post-slicing thermal annealing effectively restores the structural integrity and optical quality of CIS-processed BaTiO$_3$ flakes. Raman spectroscopy confirms the recovery of crystallinity, while second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy reveals systematic reorientation of ferroelectric domains and restoration of the associated second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor $X^{(2)}$. Notably, SHG signals persist even in regions with weak Raman signatures, indicating that long-range ferroelectric order can survive despite partial lattice disruption. Optical measurements show that the linear dispersion of annealed CIS flakes closely matches that of bulk BaTiO$_3$, validating their suitability for photonic integration. Together, these results qualify CIS - combined with thermal annealing - as a viable and scalable manufacturing strategy for high-quality BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator (BTOI) platforms, enabling advanced integrated photonic devices for modulation, frequency conversion, and quantum optics.</p>

            <p>The emerging magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a platform for exploring novel physics regarding magnetism in low dimensions and developing ultrathin spintronic applications. Here, we investigate the ultrafast dynamics of excitons in a vdW NiPS3 crystal. The temporal evolution of the transient reflection spectra indicates that the spin-correlated exciton is formed through photocarrier localization, the rate of which is independent of the magnetic degrees of freedom. However, the recombination rate of these excitons is connected with the long-range magnetic order, and this connection probably arise from a spin-flip rooted in the underlying antiferromagnetic background during the recombination. Our findings uncover intertwined coupling between carrier, lattice and spin degrees of freedom in NiPS3, which may pave the path toward ultrafast optical manipulation of spin-related quantum states in vdW antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>Ferroelectricity in perovskites is known to be suppressed by a moderate hydrostatic pressure. The notion that a polar instability should reappear in a higher pressure regime is well accepted theoretically but experiments have failed so far to provide a conclusive evidence for it. Here, we investigate a classical but comparatively underlooked ferroelectric perovskite KNbO3. We use single crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy and second-harmonic generation to explore the phase transition sequence at high pressures up to 63 GPa. We show that the ferroelectric instability manifests itself in the emergence of an incommensurate modulation of the perovskite structure that combines cation displacements and tilts of the oxygen octahedra. Soft modes associated to the tilts and the modulation are clearly observed along with persistent order-disorder signatures. This demonstrates the presence of the high-pressure polar instability in a lead-free perovskite in spite of the centrosymmetric character of all observed high-pressure phases.</p>

            <p>Hybrid quantum dot (QD)-superconductor system can be used to realize Majorana zero modes in artificial Kitaev chains. These chains provide a promising platform for the realization of Majorana qubits. Radio-frequency (RF) gate reflectometry is a fast, non-invasive, and sensitive technique that can be used to read out such qubits. In this work, we use gate reflectometry to probe two QDs coupled via a semiconductor-superconductor hybrid segment. We demonstrate that gate sensing can resolve charge stability diagrams and clearly distinguish between elastic cotunneling and crossed-Andreev reflection, the two key processes that allow one to form a Kitaev chain. Furthermore, we show that this information is accessible, even when the system is completely decoupled from the from the normal leads. In this closed regime, we show that the observed quantum capacitance signal is indicative of parity switching between the even and odd ground states. Our measurements in both open and closed regimes confirm that gate reflectometry captures the essential features of interdot coupling and parity dynamics.</p>

            <p>The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge, at the forefront of condensed matter physics and computational chemistry alike, and it is one of the targets for quantum computing. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some correlated behavior, but it is limited by the need to calculate the Green's function for the impurity model. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins the Gaussian state preparation with the time evolution to compute the necessary Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla). We discuss the potential paths forward towards realizing this use case of quantum computing in materials science.</p>

            <h2>Scaling Laws of Magnetically Driven High-order Harmonic Generation in Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ousmane Ly</p>
            <p>We investigate the scaling behavior of high harmonic generation (HHG) driven by magnetic dynamics in spin-orbit coupled systems. In contrast to optically driven HHG--where the harmonic cutoff scales as $\omega^{-3}$ with the driving frequency $\omega$--our time-dependent quantum transport simulations reveal a qualitatively distinct scaling law for magnetically driven HHG in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction: the harmonic cutoff $n_{\mathrm{max}}$ scales as $\omega^{-1}$. This fundamental difference arises from distinct excitation mechanisms--namely, spin-flip transitions driven by vectorial magnetic precession, as opposed to scalar electric fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the precession cone angle $\theta$ serves as a crucial control parameter. Increasing $\theta$ broadens the harmonic bandwidth, with peak emission achieved for nearly in-plane magnetic dynamics. Our findings establish magnetically driven HHG as a robust and tunable mechanism for nonlinear spin transport, governed by unique scaling laws with potential applications in ultrafast spintronic technologies.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmion crystals with zero net skyrmion charge and zero topological Hall response are interesting candidate phases which can occur at a vanishing magnetic field in centrosymmetric systems. We study a minimal bilayer model of skyrmion crystals having opposite chirality and topological charge in the two layers, and show that it can host nearly flat electronic bands with quasi-uniform Berry curvature and quantum metric. Using Hartree-Fock theory, we show that weak to moderate short-range electron interactions induce two distinct types of symmetry breaking patterns depending on the band dispersion: an intra-unit-cell charge density modulation from Chern band mixing or a layer-imbalanced phase with a nonzero ferroelectric polarization. Both phases break inversion symmetry leading to a spontaneous and large net topological Hall effect, with the phase diagram tunable by external electric fields. Our results may be relevant to centrosymmetric skyrmion materials such as Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ as well as artificially engineered heterostructures. We also discuss its relation to recent work on twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea León, Carmine Autieri, Thomas Brumme, Jhon W. González</p>
            <p>The interplay of strong electronic correlations, sizable octahedral distortions, and pronounced spin--orbit coupling (SOC) makes perovskite oxides promising candidates for realizing altermagnetic phases. We study altermagnetic phases in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a non-centrosymmetric layered perovskite whose ground state is a Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnet. We show that an alternative Néel-type spin arrangement hosts a P-2 $d$-wave altermagnetic state with orbital selectivity similar to Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Including SOC generates a symmetry-allowed $p$-wave component and yields a hybrid $d$/$p$-wave altermagnetic order. We further demonstrate that biaxial strain tunes both magnetic stability and band splitting: compressive strain beyond 2\% favors the altermagnetic phase over the antiferromagnetic ground state, while tensile strain increases altermagnetic splittings by up to 9\%. To quantify these trends, we define an altermagnetic figure of merit and trace its strain dependence to changes in electronic localization and octahedral geometry in this polar metal.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy</h2>

            <p>The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear projection for ballistic correlation functions: a formula in terms of minimal connected covers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Doyon</p>
            <p>In many-body systems, the dynamics is governed, at large scales of space and time, by the hydrodynamic principle of projection onto the conserved densities admitted by the model. This is formalised as local relaxation of fluctuations in the Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, and is a nonlinear version of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. We use it to derive a projection formula, expressing $n$-point connected correlation functions (cumulants) of generic observables at different space-time points, in terms of those of conserved densities. This applies in every $d\geq 1$ spatial dimensions and under the ballistic scaling of space and time, both in and out of equilibrium. It generalises the well-known linear-response principle for 2-point functions. For higher-point functions, one needs to account for nonlinear fluctuations of conserved densities and, correspondingly, higher derivatives of local averages. Using Malyshev's formula for the cumulant expansion, and keeping the leading order, the result is a nonlinear projection, expressed as a sum of products of correlation functions of conserved densities with equilibrium multivariances as coefficients. The sum is combinatorially organised via certain covers of the set of space-time points, which we call minimal connected covers. We use this in order to get general, explicit formulas for two- and three-point functions in stationary states, expressed in terms of thermodynamic and Euler-scale data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijeet Alase, Marcus C. Goffage, Maja C. Cassidy, Susan N. Coppersmith</p>
            <p>Qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have attracted intense interest as a platform for utility-scale quantum computing, due to their promise of intrinsically low error rates enabled by topological protection. These error rates are expected to be suppressed exponentially with increasing nanowire length or decreasing temperature. Here we identify a fundamental decoherence mechanism that challenges this expectation. The high-frequency components of 1/f charge noise, ubiquitous in semiconductor devices, can excite quasiparticles in the bulk of the topological superconductor, which travel to the ends of the nanowire to poison the MZMs. This mechanism leads to qubit errors that grow with the length of the nanowire. We calculate the excitation rates for clean nanowires and show that this noise imposes a strict limit on the coherence times of the qubits currently being developed, reducing them to less than one microsecond even under ideal conditions. These timescales are significantly shorter than those required for gate operations, posing a serious obstacle to the scalability of Majorana-based quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interplay between topology and correlated electron states is central to the study of quantum materials. TaTe$_4$ is a quasi-one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) compound predicted to host topological phases, which makes it a model platform to explore this interplay. Here, we combine high-field magnetotransport measurements with density functional theory calculations to provide a comprehensive mapping of the Fermi surface (FS) of TaTe$_4$ in its CDW phase. Using multiple current-field geometries, we resolve the four largest of six pockets of the FS predicted by theory and find no evidence of non-CDW bands, highlighting the full reconstruction of the FS in the bulk. We identify a previously unobserved quasi-cylindrical pocket and uncover a large size orbit consistent with magnetic breakdown between reconstructed FS sheets, from which we estimate a CDW gap of $\sim$0.29~eV. Moreover, we observe a robust linear magnetoresistance that persists across all field directions when current flows perpendicular to the 1D chains along which the CDW is formed, with a distinct high-field linear regime emerging when field is along the chains. These findings establish TaTe$_4$ as a prototypical material to study the coexistence of correlation-driven reconstruction and topological electronic states.</p>

            <p>Since the pioneering work Lohani et. al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 041063 (2019), it became clear that quantum skyrmions have highly unusual properties as compared to the classical skyrmions and, due to their quantumness, cannot be described by continuous magnetic textures akin to the classical skyrmions. Competing nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in triangular spin-frustrated magnets lead to the formation of quantum skyrmion states. In frustrated magnets, skyrmions are characterized by the helical degree of freedom, which can store quantum information. In the limit of a weak electric field, the system can be described as a two-level system, i.e., a skyrmion qubit. Here, we propose a more general formulation of the problem and obtain general analytic solution of the model previously introduced in Psaroudaki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 067201 (2021). Our solution is valid not only for small barrier but for the arbitrary electric field. In the case of a significant barrier, we prove that the system's state is not a Skyrmion qubit as it was thought before, but a Skyrmion qudit. We constructed the density matrix of the Skyrmion qudit and studied its evolution in time. The obtained results suggest that the proposed model can be exploited further to meet the needs of quantum information theory and quantum skyrmionics. We showed that the $l_1$ norm of coherence of the skyrmion quantum qudit is a thousand times larger than the coherence of the skyrmion quantum qubit. The obtained result opens new perspectives for quantum skyrmion-based resource theory.</p>

            <p>The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.</p>

            <h2>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeru Utsumi, Yoshifumi Nakata</p>
            <p>Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits capable of recovering quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. These are applicable to both entanglement-assisted and non-assisted settings. By developing a technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the decoders, we show that they are applicable to any noise model. As a consequence, for any noisy channel, our decoders can be used to achieve a communication rate arbitrarily close to the quantum capacity by increasing the number of channel uses. To construct the decoders, we employ the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise. Our constructions offer advantages in the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previous explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</p>

            <p>In confluent cell monolayers, patterns of cell forces and motion are systematically altered near topological defects in cell shape. In turn, defects have been proposed to alter cell density, extrusion, and invasion, but it remains unclear how the defects form and how they affect cell forces and motion. Here, we studied +1/2 defects, and, in contrast to prior studies, we observed the concurrent occurrence of both tail-to-head and head-to-tail defect motion in the same cell monolayer. We quantified the cell velocities, the tractions at the cell-substrate interface, and the stresses within the cell layer near +1/2 defects. Results revealed that both traction and stress are sources of activity and dissipation within the epithelial cell monolayer, with the direction of motion of +1/2 defects depending on whether energy is injected by stresses or tractions. Interestingly, patterns of motion, traction, stress, and energy injection near +1/2 defects existed before defect formation, suggesting that defects form as a result of spatially coordinated patterns in cell forces and motion. These findings introduce a new focus, on coordinated patterns of force and motion that lead to defect formation and motion.</p>

We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one in which the time-averaged SRE saturates the random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the steady-state SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the steady-state} SRE linearly increases with the system size in all the considered cases, and displays no measurement-induced quantum transition, as confirmed by the curves of the steady-state SRE versus the system size.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel J. Garratt, Max McGinley</p>
            <p>We use concepts from quantum cryptography to relate the entanglement in many-body mixed states to standard correlation functions. If a system can be used as a resource for distilling private keys -- random classical bits that are shared by spatially separated observers but hidden from an eavesdropper having access to the environment -- we can infer that the state of the system is entangled. For thermal states, we derive a simple relation between the information accessible to the eavesdropper and the linear response of the system. This relation allows us to determine which spatial correlations can be used to detect entanglement across wide varieties of physical systems, and provides a new experimental probe of entanglement. We also show that strong symmetries of a density matrix imply the existence of correlations that are always hidden from the environment. This result implies that, although grand canonical ensembles are separable above a finite temperature, canonical ensembles are generically entangled at all finite temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Global graph features unveiled by unsupervised geometric deep learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirja Granfors, Jesús Pineda, Blanca Zufiria Gerbolés, Joana B. Pereira, Carlo Manzo, Giovanni Volpe</p>
            <p>Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability poses significant challenges for analysis and classification. To address these challenges, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework designed to capture both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers linked through skip connections, which preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. Even though identical or highly similar underlying parameters describing a system's state can lead to significant variability in graph realizations, GAUDI consistently maps them into nearby regions of a structured and continuous latent space, effectively disentangling invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate GAUDI's versatility across multiple applications, including small-world networks modeling, characterization of protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analysis of collective motion in the Vicsek model, and identification of age-related changes in brain connectivity. Comparison with related approaches highlights GAUDI's superior performance in analyzing complex graphs, providing new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.</p>

            <h2>Unstable periodic orbits galore and quantum hyperscarring in highly frustrated magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Pizzi, Claudio Castelnovo, Johannes Knolle</p>
            <p>Highly frustrated magnets, with their macroscopically-degenerate classical ground states and massively-entangled quantum spin liquid phases, have been pivotal to the development of modern condensed matter concepts such as emergent symmetries, topological order, and fractionalisation. The effects of frustration and massive degeneracies at high energy, where the many-body dynamics becomes chaotic, have hitherto been far less explored. Here, we identify a high-energy dynamical analog of highly-frustrated magnetism, in the form of an extensive manifold of classical ''interaction-suppressing'' configurations giving rise to unstable periodic orbits. These are in general neither protected by symmetry nor integrability, and emerge from a set of dynamical local constraints that effectively nullify the interactions while allowing extensively many local degrees of freedom. The proliferation of unstable periodic orbits corresponds in the quantum case to ''hyperscarring'', that is, quantum scarring on exponentially many unstable periodic orbits. On the product states associated to the latter, the amplitudes of the mid-spectrum thermal eigenstates exhibit a power-law distribution, in stark contrast to the expected exponential Porter-Thomas distribution that holds for generic product states. Our results reveal a new constrained dynamical regime where many-body quantum chaos coexists with structured manifolds of coherent dynamics, and establishes a mechanism for hitherto elusive extensive scarring.</p>

            <p>Microcavity exciton-polariton condensates under additional transverse confinement constitute a flexible optical platform to study the coupling mechanism between confined nonequilibrium and nonlinear states of matter. Driven far from equilibrium, polariton condensates can display spontaneous synchronization and instabilities depending on excitation and material parameters, showcasing emergent and intricate interference patterns based on mode competition over mutual gain landscapes. Here, we explore this coupling mechanism between polariton condensates populating the first excited ${\it p}$-state manifold of coupled optically trapped condensates and show a rich structure of patterns based on excitation parameters. The optical reconfigurability of the laser excitation patterns enables the creation of an annular-shaped beam to confine polaritons in a tailored trapping potential, whilst the dissipative nature of the optical traps enables effective interaction with neighboring condensates. Our results underpin the potential role of polariton condensates in exploring and simulating $\sigma$ and $\pi$ molecular bonding mechanisms between artificial two-dimensional diatomic orbitals and beyond.</p>

            <p>The class of unconventional superconductors, particularly noncentrosymmetric superconductors, has been highly considered as potential materials for understanding the complex properties of quantum materials. Here, five previously unreported Re3.5Os3.5Ta0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3Os3Ta0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3.5Os3.5Mo0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3.5Os3.5Mo0.5W0.5Nb3, and Re3Os3Mo0.5Hf0.5Nb3 Re-Os-based high/medium-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) with valence electron count ranging from 6.45 to 6.81 were synthesized and investigated using x-ray diffraction, transport, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. Our analyses confirm that all five compounds crystallize in a noncentrosymmetric {\alpha}-Mn-type structure and exhibit type-II superconductivity with Tc values from 4.20 K to 5.11 K, respectively. Unexpectedly, despite being immersed in an acidic environment for one month, the structures and superconducting properties of HEAs remain stable. Our findings indicate that the Tc increases with an increasing valence electron count in MEAs-HEAs. Furthermore, these noncentrosymmetric {\alpha}-Mn-type HEA superconductors have large Kadowaki-Woods ratios (KWR), implying the presence of strong electronic correlations.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting gap symmetry of 2DEG at (111)-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Czarnecki, M. Zegrodnik, P. Wójcik</p>
            <p>We investigate the superconducting properties of the two-dimensional electron gas at the (111) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. Using a multiorbital tight-binding model defined on a hexagonal lattice, we analyze the emergence of superconductivity driven by both interlayer (nearest-neighbor) and intralayer (next-nearest-neighbor) pairing interactions, with a particular focus on the symmetry of the superconducting gap. We demonstrate that, in both pairing scenarios, the superconducting gap transforms according to the $A_1$ irreducible representation of the $C_{6v}$ point group. Within the interlayer pairing scenario, the superconducting phase is characterized by a fully gapped quasiparticle excitation spectrum exhibiting extended $s$-wave symmetry, accompanied by an enhancement of the superconducting gap magnitude in the vicinity of the van Hove singularity. Conversely, the intralayer pairing channel produces a distinctive double-dome structure in the superconducting phase diagram, with the gap symmetry evolving from a fully gapped, extended $s$-wave at low carrier densities to a nodal extended $s$-wave state at higher electron concentrations. The qualitative agreement with experimentally observed nonmonotonic behavior of the critical temperature $T_c(V_g)$ suggests that intralayer next-nearest-neighbor pairing may play a dominant role in the superconductivity of the (111) LAO/STO interface.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiling Wei, Zhengzhong Du, Xiaodong Cao, Wen-Long You, Yi Lu</p>
            <p>Higher-spin quantum magnets with competing interactions offer a rich platform for exploring quantum phases that transcend the paradigms of spin-1/2 systems, owing to their enlarged local Hilbert spaces and the emergence of multipolar correlations. We investigate a one-dimensional spin-1 chain where quadrupolar order is promoted by two distinct mechanisms: conventional bilinear-biquadratic exchange and bond-directional antiferromagnetic Kitaev frustration. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations, we determine the complete ground-state phase diagram and uncover two emergent phases induced by the Kitaev interaction: a Kitaev nematic phase and a Kitaev-dimer phase. The Kitaev nematic phase emerges from a fragile biquadratic dimer state via a continuous quantum phase transition in the Ising universality class. The Kitaev dimer phase spontaneously breaks a screw symmetry to favor either $x$- or $y$-spin bonding, forming a gapped state that coexists with a crystalline order of alternating $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes.</p>

            <h2>Many-body perturbation theory vs. density functional theory: A systematic benchmark for band gaps of solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Großmann, Marc Thieme, Malte Grunert, Erich Runge</p>
            <p>We benchmark many-body perturbation theory against density functional theory (DFT) for the band gaps of solids. We systematically compare four $GW$ variants $-$ $G_{0}W_{0}$ using the Godby-Needs plasmon-pole approximation ($G_{0}W_{0}$-PPA), full-frequency quasiparticle $G_{0}W_{0}$ (QP$G_{0}W_{0}$), full-frequency quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ (QS$GW$), and QS$GW$ augmented with vertex corrections in $W$ (QS$G\hat{W}$) $-$ against the currently best performing and popular density functionals mBJ and HSE06. Our results show that $G_{0}W_{0}$-PPA calculations offer only a marginal accuracy gain over the best DFT methods, however at a higher cost. Replacing the PPA with a full-frequency integration of the dielectric screening improves the predictions dramatically, almost matching the accuracy of the QS$G\hat{W}$. The QS$GW$ removes starting-point bias, but systematically overestimates experimental gaps by about $15\%$. Adding vertex corrections to the screened Coulomb interaction, i.e., performing a QS$G\hat{W}$ calculation, eliminates the overestimation, producing band gaps that are so accurate that they even reliably flag questionable experimental measurements.</p>

            <p>Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and 2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover, there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and classical phase transitions.</p>

            <p>In Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers, higher-order harmonics of the pump tone and its sidebands are commonly present and typically regarded as parasitic. Consequently, most design efforts have focused on suppressing these harmonics. In spite of that, motivated by transient simulations, we extend the coupled-mode theory and demonstrate that, contrary to conventional belief, the third harmonic can enhance amplifier performance, improving both gain and bandwidth. We show that the recently developed plasma oscillation-based amplifier is particularly well-suited for exploiting this effect. Their dispersion relation enables us to observe the phenomenon in transient numerical simulations using JoSIM and WRspice. These simulations reveal improvement of the amplifier's performance, specifically the doubling of the bandwidth and an increase in the gain.</p>

            <p>Phase transition materials such as NdNiO3 (NNO) when coupled with low damping ferromagnets such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) can lead to new multi-functional material systems harnessing the interplay of charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom. In this study, we probe the evolution of the spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial all-oxide LSMO (12 nm)/NNO (4, 8, and 16 nm) bilayers. Using spin pumping ferromagnetic resonance we track the spin-charge conversion in the NNO layer through the paramagnetic metal to antiferromagnetic insulator transition and observe a pronounced enhancement of the inverse spin Hall effect signal at the onset of this transition. We attribute this enhancement to the electronic and magnetic disorder in NNO at the first-order phase transition, thereby providing insights into the mechanism of spin transport through the phase transition. The tunability of spin charge conversion in this low damping bilayer system offers a pathway for developing multifunctional, energy-efficient spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Stacking-induced type-II quantum spin Hall insulators with high spin Chern number in unconventional magnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao-Yang Tan, Panjun Feng, Ze-Feng Gao, Fengjie Ma, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>Generally, stacking two monolayer type-I quantum spin Hall insulators gives rise to a trivial insulator. However, whether or not stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators results in a trivial insulator has not yet been explored. In this letter, based on the calculations of lattice model, we demonstrate that stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators does not yield a trivial insulator, but instead forms a quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern number. In this phase, there are two pairs of topological edge states with opposite chirality and polarization coexisting in the boundary. Our calculations further reveal that the quantized spin Hall conductance of the bilayer is twice that of the monolayer. When U(1) symmetry is present, the high spin Chern number phase remains stable; when U(1) symmetry is broken, it persists over a broad parameter range. Furthermore, based on the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we propose that bilayer Nb$_2$SeTeO is a type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern number. Finally, extending this strategy to multilayer stacks naturally leads to quantum spin Hall insulator with larger spin Chern number. Our work not only deepens the distinction between type-I and type-II quantum spin Hall insulators, but also offers a route toward realizing highly quantized spin Hall conductance.</p>

            <h2>Disorder-induced stress-flow misalignment in soft glassy materials revealed using multi-directional shear</h2>

            <p>Controlling the mechanical response of soft glassy materials, such as emulsions, foams, and colloidal suspensions, is key for many industrial processes. While their steady-state flow behavior is reasonably well understood, their response to complex flow histories, as encountered in operations like pumping or mixing, remains poorly known. Using a custom multi-axis shear apparatus that enables arbitrary changes in flow direction, we investigate how shear history influences the mechanical behavior of a model soft glassy system. We uncover a transient shear response orthogonal to the applied shear direction, together with an anisotropic yield surface. These effects point to an underlying anisotropic distribution of internal stresses imprinted by previous deformation. To rationalize this behavior, we use a mesoscopic elasto-plastic model, demonstrating that local mechanical disorder governs the emergence of macroscopic stress-flow misalignment. Our findings offer a new route to experimentally probe the distribution of local yield stresses in soft glassy materials.</p>

            <p>Kramers-Wannier duality, a hallmark of the Ising model, has recently gained renewed interest through its reinterpretation as a non-invertible symmetry with a state-level action. Using sequential quantum circuits (SQC), we argue that this duality governs the stability of quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states in a nonintegrable model, depending on whether the dual preserves the embedding conditions for scarring. This is supported by striking agreement between first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics despite chaotic spectra. Our results suggest that non-invertible dualities provide both a generative mechanism for new QMBS and a diagnostic for their stability.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy in a Non-Abelian Fractional Quantum Hall State</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark J. Arildsen, Valentin Crépel, Nicolas Regnault, Benoit Estienne</p>
            <p>Symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy provides a powerful framework for probing the internal structure of quantum many-body states by decomposing entanglement into contributions from distinct symmetry sectors. In this work, we apply matrix product state techniques to study the bosonic, non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall state, enabling precise numerical evaluation of both the full counting statistics and symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our results reveal an approximate equipartition of entanglement among symmetry sectors, consistent with theoretical expectations and subject to finite-size corrections. The results also show that these expectations for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy remain valid in the case of a non-Abelian state where the topological sectors cannot be distinguished by the Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry alone, and where neutral and charged modes possess distinct velocities. We additionally perform a detailed comparison of the entanglement spectrum with predictions from the Li-Haldane conjecture, finding remarkable agreement, and enabling a more precise understanding of the effects of the distinct neutral and charged velocities. This not only provides a stringent test of the conjecture but also highlights its explanatory power in understanding the origin and structure of finite-size effects across different symmetry sectors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shrigyan Brahmachari, Austin Hulse, Henry D. Pfister, Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$ qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests, a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error $\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as quantum state tomography and metrology.</p>

            <p>Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This information-theoretic analysis may provide a theoretical basis for regulating turbulence by controlling zonal flow.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saskia Demulder, Maria Knysh, Andrew Rolph</p>
            <p>We examine the effective field theory (EFT) of maximal chaos through the lens of Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. We test the relationship between two measures of quantum chaos: out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Krylov complexity. In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\lambda_L = 2\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators. We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\lambda_K = \lambda_L$ and $\lambda_K = \lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\lambda_L \leq \lambda_K \leq 2\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Travaglino, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese</p>
            <p>We consider the effect of projective measurements on the quench dynamics of the bipartite entanglement entropy in one dimensional free fermionic systems. In our protocol, we consider projective measurements of a $U(1)$ conserved charge, the particle number, on some large subsystem, and study the entanglement entropies between the same subsystem and its complement. We compare the dynamics emanating from two classes of initial states, one which is an eigenstate of the charge and another which is not. Moreover, we consider the effects of a single measurement as well as multiple which are periodically performed. Using the quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytic expressions for the behaviour of the entanglement which admit a transparent physical interpretation. In general, we find that measurements introduce two distinct types of corrections to the entanglement, which can be interpreted separately as classical and quantum contributions. The classical contribution is independent of the measurement outcome and scales logarithmically with variance of the charge distribution. In contrast, the quantum contribution depends on the specific measurement outcome and can be significant for individual realizations; however, it becomes negligible when averaged over all possible outcomes. Our expressions reduce to previously known results for symmetry resolved entanglement and full counting statistics in some relevant limits, and are confirmed by an exact calculation performed on the Néel initial state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seiji Aota, Masaaki Tanaka</p>
            <p>A newly identified class of magnetic materials called altermagnets has attracted much attention due to the practical properties of spin-splitting bands akin to ferromagnets and small compensated magnetization akin to antiferromagnets. These features make them promising candidates for applications in spintronics devices. Among candidate materials, CrSb is promising because of its high ordering temperature (~705 K) and large spin-splitting energy; however, it is predicted that tuning the Néel vector requires additional symmetry breaking or a change in the easy magnetization axis. While applying epitaxial strain can modulate the symmetry, the selection of substrates with closely matched lattice constants for heteroepitaxial growth is limited for altermagnets, which generally have low crystal symmetry. Therefore, exploring the heteroepitaxial growth of altermagnet thin films on well-established, dissimilar crystal systems is valuable. (001)-oriented III-V semiconductors, which share group-V elements with the overgrown CrSb, offer an ideal platform because they are expected to have material compatibility with stable interfaces, as well as tunability of the buffer layer's bandgap and lattice constant by varying the atomic composition of their group-III and group-V atoms. In this study, we have achieved the molecular beam epitaxial growth of a CrSb ($\bar{1}10$) thin film on a GaAs (001) substrate by inserting thin FeSb ($\bar{1}10$) / AlAs (001) buffer layers. The in-plane epitaxial relationship is found to be CrSb [110] $\|$ GaAs [110] and CrSb [001] $\|$ GaAs [$\bar{1}10$], and epitaxial strain is also confirmed. We also characterized the magneto-transport properties of the grown CrSb thin film. Although the obtained conductivity tensors are mainly explained by a two-carrier model, not by an anomalous Hall effect, this model reveals the presence of high-mobility electron and hole carriers.</p>

Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role.</p>

            <h2>Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tongshuai Zhu, Di Zhou, Huaiqiang Wang, Jiawei Ruan</p>
            <p>Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent frontier in condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts exhibiting odd-parity spin splittings remain largely unexplored. Here, based on symmetry argument, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be induced from collinear antiferromagnets. Remarkably, using effective model analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices induces both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Stability analysis through folds: An end-loaded elastic with a lever arm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siva Prasad Chakri Dhanakoti</p>
            <p>Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.</p>

            <h2>MOFClassifier: A Machine Learning Approach for Validating Computation-Ready Metal-Organic Frameworks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guobin Zhao, Pengyu Zhao, Yongchul G. Chung</p>
            <p>The computational discovery and design of new crystalline materials, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), heavily relies on high-quality, computation-ready structural data. However, recent studies have revealed significant error rates within existing MOF databases, posing a critical data problem that hinders efficient high-throughput computational screening. While rule-based algorithms like MOSAEC, MOFChecker, and the Chen and Manz method (Chen-Manz) have been developed to address this, they often suffer from inherent limitations and misclassification of structures. To overcome this challenge, we developed MOFClassifier, a novel machine learning approach built upon a positive-unlabeled crystal graph convolutional neural network (PU-CGCNN) model. MOFClassifier learns intricate patterns from perfect crystal structures to predict a crystal-likeness score (CLscore), effectively classifying MOFs as computation-ready. Our model achieves a ROC value of 0.979 (previous best 0.912) and, importantly, can identify subtle structural and chemical errors that are undetectable by current rule-based methods. By accurately recovering previously misclassified false-negative structures, MOFClassifier reduces the risk of overlooking promising material candidates in large-scale computational screening campaigns. This user-friendly tool is freely available and has been integrated into the prepara-tion workflow for the updated CoRE MOF DB 2025 v1.0, contributing to accelerated computational discovery of MOF materials.</p>

            <p>We systematically investigate the equilibrium and the nonequilibrium quench dynamics of three-dimensional disordered quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensates. Within the Bogoliubov-Huang-Meng approximation, we show that the combined effect of quenched interactions, disorder and excitations may modify the static as well as the dynamic properties of the system. The validity criterion of the developed approach is accurately established. By quenching the interaction strength, we reveal that the quantum depletion and the deformation condensate induced by disorder are enhanced in the asymptotic steady state compared to the corresponding equilibrium values. The time evolution of the condensate deformation is accompanied by damped oscillations with amplitudes strongly depend on the disorder correlation length and on the relative quadrupolar interaction.</p>

            <h2>Absence of dissipation-free topological edge states in quadratic open fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Mao</p>
            <p>We prove a no-go theorem that generic quadratic open fermionic systems, governed by Lindblad master equations, cannot host dissipation-free topological edge states. Drawing an analogy to topological insulators and superconductors, we map the Lindbladian to a first-quantized matrix representation that encodes the band structure, whose zero-energy topological edge modes are exactly dissipation-free. This matrix, however, is always adiabatically connected to a topologically trivial matrix, even under symmetry constraints. We formulate s rigorous adiabatic path to demonstrate this property. Thus, there is no robust dissipation-free edge modes protected by the bulk topology in quadratic open fermions, under any unitary or anti-unitary symmetries. Our result applies to generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians, requiring only gapped bulk and bounded spectrum for technical convenience. Our result establish a definitive boundary for the existence of robust topological phenomena in open fermionic systems.</p>

            <p>Arrays of hybrid metal-semiconductor islands offer a new approach to quantum simulation, with key advantages over arrays of conventional quantum dots. Because the metallic component of these hybrid islands has a quasi-continuous level spectrum, each site in an array can be effectively electronically identical; in contrast, each conventional semiconductor quantum dot has its own spectral fingerprint. Meanwhile, the semiconductor component retains gate-tunability of intersite coupling. This combination creates a scalable platform for simulating correlated ground states driven by Coulomb interactions. We report the fabrication and characterization of hybrid metal-semiconductor islands, featuring a submicron metallic component transparently contacting a gate-confined region of an InAs quantum well with tunable couplings to macroscopic leads. Tuning to the weak-coupling limit forms a single-electron transistor with highly-uniform Coulomb peaks, with no resolvable excitation spectrum in the Coulomb diamonds. Upon increasing the transmissions toward the ballistic regime we observe an evolution to dynamical Coulomb blockade.</p>

            <p>Superconductor qubits typically use aluminum-aluminum oxide tunnel junctions to provide the non-linear inductance. Junctions with semiconductor barriers make it possible to vary the superconductor material and explore beyond aluminum. We use InAs semiconductor nanowires coated with thin superconducting shells of beta-Sn to realize transmon qubits. By tuning the Josephson energy with a gate voltage, we adjust the qubit frequency over a range of 3 GHz. The longest energy relaxation time, T1 = 27 microseconds, is obtained at the lowest qubit frequencies, while the longest echo dephasing time, T2 = 1.8 microseconds, is achieved at higher frequencies. We assess the possible factors limiting coherence times in these devices and discuss steps to enhance performance through improvements in materials fabrication and circuit design.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical generation of geometric squeezing in interacting Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Chen, Fei Zhu, Zheng Tang, Liang Zeng, Jae Joon Lee, Han Pu</p>
            <p>When the rotating frequency of a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) confined in a weak anisotropic harmonic potential is suddenly quenched to its trapping frequency, the condensate evolves from its ground state to a single-mode squeezed state with exponentially growing quantum fluctuation anisotropy. Such a squeezed state is called the geometrically squeezed state. However, for interacting BECs with two-body collisions, a similar quench only results in quantum fluctuations oscillating periodically without squeezing. In this work, we identify superfluid stability as the key factor behind this non-squeezing phenomenon, with the periodic oscillations arising from collective excitations of a stable collective excitation mode. By strategically breaking the stability criteria, we propose a dynamical approach for generating squeezing that can exponentially suppress quantum fluctuations in a relatively short time, surpassing the efficiency of existing experimental preparation schemes.</p>

            <h2>Four-mode quantum sensing and Fisher information in a spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Zhu, Zheng Tang, Liang Zeng, Shu Wang, Li Chen</p>
            <p>Multi-mode squeezing and entanglement are important resources in quantum metrology and sensing. For spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensates subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC), previous studies on spin squeezing have been limited to two-mode systems. In this work, we demonstrate that such a system can naturally construct a four-mode model spanning an $\mathfrak{su}(4)$ algebra with six SU(2) subspaces. Using spin squeezing parameters and quantum Fisher information matrices, we analyze the dynamical evolution of coherent spin states. The results show that, beyond two-mode models, the SOC-induced four-mode couplings give rise to richer entanglement-enhanced sensing approaching the Heisenberg limit across various SU(2) subspaces. Additionally, by tuning a single system parameter (the Raman Rabi frequency), one can selectively control the optimal measurement directions across different subspaces.</p>

            <h2>$\boldsymbol{d}$-vector precession induced pumping in topological $p$-wave superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun-Jie Fu, Jin An</p>
            <p>Time-reversal invariant $p$-wave superconductors (SCs) are characterized by their $\boldsymbol{d}$-vectors, whose orientations could be manipulated by a tiny magnetic field. We study in this paper the adiabatic pumping process induced by periodically rotating $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector in a topological $p$-wave SC, which is coupled to two normal leads. If $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector rotates nearly within a plane, the pumped spin $2S_z/\hbar$ over one cycle is nearly quantized at $2$ without net charge pumping. When the pumping lead is fully spin-polarized, both the pumped charge $Q/e$ and spin $2S_z/\hbar$ would peak nearly at $1$. When a mixing $s$-wave pairing component is taken into account, a topological phase transition can be driven by modulating the ratio between the pairing components. We found a sharp resonance phenomenon near the phase transition when the $p$-wave $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector is adiabatically rotating, which may help experimentally distinguish the topological SCs from trivial ones.</p>

            <h2>Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p>

            <p>Topology and anomalies lead to edge modes that can interact with critical bulk fluctuations. To study this setup, pertaining to boundary criticality, we consider a model exhibiting a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a dynamically generated quantum spin Hall state (i.e.a topological Mott insulator) and an s-wave superconductor. For the topological Mott insulator, the bulk Goldstone modes are shown to be irrelevant at the helical Luttinger liquid fixed points. The deconfined quantum critical point is an instance of an emergent anomaly, and we observe a sharp localized edge state at this point. The sharpness of the edge mode is consistent with an ordinary phase in which electronic edge modes decouple from critical edge bosonic fluctuations. At the DQCP, the scaling dimension of the edge electron shows a jump, a feature argued to be a signature of the emergent anomaly. Our results are based on large-scale auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo this http URL also carry out calculations for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model to confirm spectral features of the ordinary and extraordinary-log phases in the vicinity of the bulk critical point.</p>

            <h2>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng-Tai Lee, Tom Lubensky, Tomer Markovich</p>
            <p>Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</p>

Similar to twisted moire materials, we uncover rich topology and interesting band flattening effects, which we summarize in relevant plots such as a topological phase diagram. Our work demonstrates that much of the interesting phenomenology of twisted moire materials under the influence of electromagnetic waves seems to be generically present even in more experimentally accessible untwisted moire platforms, which remain highly tunable by light.</p>

            <p>Photonic media modulated periodically in time, termed photonic time crystals (PTCs), have attracted considerable attention for their ability to open momentum bandgaps hosting amplifying modes. These momentum gaps, however, generally appear only at the system's parametric resonance condition which constrain many features derived from amplification to a narrow frequency band. Moreover, they are accompanied by exceptional points (EPs) that render their analysis more intricate. Here, we show that a careful consideration of dispersion and absorption can overcome these issues. By investigating the dissipated power of a point-dipole embedded in a dispersive and absorptive PTC, we unveil that temporal modulation enables the conversion of dipole emission into dipole absorption within a broadband frequency window free of EPs. We demonstrate that this effect is general and occurs from weak modulation strengths to low modulation frequencies, and can be achieved for various material platforms. Moreover, we show the possibility of both broadband inhibition and large increase of dissipated power, depending on the modulated parameter.</p>

            <p>Controlling the coupling between different degrees of freedom in many-body systems is a powerful technique for engineering novel phases of matter. We create a bilayer system of two-dimensional (2D) ultracold Bose gases and demonstrate the controlled generation of bulk coherence through tunable interlayer Josephson coupling. We probe the resulting correlation properties of both phase modes of the bilayer system: the symmetric phase mode is studied via a noise-correlation method, while the antisymmetric phase fluctuations are directly captured by matter-wave interferometry. The measured correlation functions for both of these modes exhibit a crossover from short-range to quasi-long-range order above a coupling-dependent critical point, thus providing direct evidence of bilayer superfluidity mediated by interlayer coupling. We map out the phase diagram and interpret it with renormalization-group theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through the observation of suppressed vortex excitations in the antisymmetric mode.</p>

The hybrid KZS (HKZS) in the overlapping critical region of non-Hermitian DAA and Anderson localization is proposed and numerically confirmed the validity across a local-to-skin quench direction.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun-jie Shi, Yao-hui Zhu</p>
            <p>Unlike ordinary conductors and semiconductors, which conduct electricity through individual electrons, superconductors usually conduct electricity through pairs of electrons, known as Cooper pairs. Even after 4 decades of intense study, no one knows what holds electrons together in complex high-$T_c$ oxides. Here, targeting the critical challenge of the pairing mechanism behind high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates and nickelates, we create a new theoretical framework by standing on the foundation of the chemical-bond$\rightarrow$structure$\rightarrow$property relationship. Considering the dominance of eV-scale ionic bonding, affinity of O$^-$ (1.46 eV) and O$^{2-}$ (-8.08 eV) and large second ionization energy ($\sim$10-20 eV) of metal atoms, we propose a groundbreaking idea of electron e$^-$ (hole h$^+$) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, i.e., the ionic-bond-driven $\mathbf{e^--O-e^-}$ ($\mathbf{h^+-M-h^+}$) itinerant Cooper pairing, by following the principle of "tracing electron footprints to explore pairing mechanisms". Its correctness and universality are confirmed by 32 diverse experimental evidences, especially, the STM topographic image combining with the small Cooper-pair size. Any other sub-eV and covalent-binding pairing mechanisms would be doubtful. Our findings resolve a 40-year puzzle of the microscopic mechanism for high-$T_c$ superconductivity and validate the feasibility of room-temperature carrier-pairing in ionic-bonded superconductors, bringing the dream of room-temperature superconductivity one step closer.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that exhibit topological stability, which, along with novel thermal and electrical transport properties, make them the ideal candidates for a variety of novel technological applications. Accessing the skyrmion spin texture at the nanoscale and understanding its interaction with local thermal gradients is essential for engineering skyrmion-based transport phenomena. However, direct experimental insight into the local thermoelectric response of single skyrmions remains limited. To address this, we employ scanning thermoelectric microscopy~(SThEM) to probe the nanoscale thermoelectric response from a single skyrmion. By mapping the local thermoelectric voltage with nanoscale precision, we reveal a unique spatially resolved response that is the convolution of the underlying spin texture of the skyrmion and its interaction with the highly localised thermal gradient originating from the heated probe. We combine this with thermoelectric modelling of a range of skyrmion spin textures to reveal unique thermoelectric responses and allow the possibility of SThEM to be used as a tool to distinguish nanoscale spin textures. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interaction of topologically protected spin textures with local thermal gradients and the resultant spin transport. We demonstrate a novel route to characterise nanoscale spin textures, accelerating the material optimisation cycle, while also opening the possibility to harness skyrmions for spin caloritronics.</p>

            <p>Aside from recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models, specialized AI hardware is crucial to address large volumes of unstructured and dynamic data. Hardware-based AI, built on conventional complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS)-technology, faces several critical challenges including scaling limitation of devices [1, 2], separation of computation and memory units [3] and most importantly, overall system energy efficiency [4]. While numerous materials with emergent functionalities have been proposed to overcome these limitations, scalability, reproducibility, and compatibility remain critical obstacles [5, 6]. Here, we demonstrate oxide-interface based polymorphic electronic devices with programmable transistor, memristor, and memcapacitor functionalities by manipulating the quasi-two-dimensional electron gas in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures [7, 8] using lateral gates. A circuit utilizing two polymorphic functionalities of transistor and memcapacitor exhibits nonlinearity and short-term memory, enabling implementation in physical reservoir computing. An integrated circuit incorporating transistor and memristor functionalities is utilized for the transition from short- to long-term synaptic plasticity and for logic operations, along with in-situ logic output storage. The same circuit with advanced reconfigurable synaptic logic operations presents high-level multi-input decision-making tasks, such as patient-monitoring in healthcare applications. Our findings pave the way for oxide-based monolithic integrated circuits in a scalable, silicon compatible, energy efficient single platform, advancing both the polymorphic and neuromorphic computings.</p>

            <p>A fundamental idea in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are shaped and constrained by the brain's structural organization. Despite significant progress in mapping and analyzing structural connectomes, the principles linking the brain's physical architecture to its functional capabilities remain elusive. Here, we introduce an algebraic quantum model to bridge this theoretical gap, offering new insights into the relationship between the connectome and emergent brain functions, while connecting structural data to functional predictions. Using the well-mapped C. elegans anatomical and extrasynaptic connectomes, we demonstrate that brain functions, defined as functional networks of a neural system, emerge as thermal equilibrium states of an algebraic quantum system derived from the graph algebra of the underlying directed multigraph. Specifically, these equilibrium states, characterized by the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) formalism, reveal how individual neurons contribute to functional network formation. Our model illuminates the structure-function relationship in neural circuits through two key features: (1) a functional connectome that delineates topologically driven neuronal interactions and (2) an Integration Capacity (IC) index that quantifies how effectively neurons coordinate and modulate diverse information flows. Together, these features provide a statistical and mechanistic account of information flow and reveal how the network topology of the connectome predicts cognition and complex behaviors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre-Antoine Bernard, Gilles Parez, Luc Vinet</p>
            <p>This review presents recent developments in the study of inhomogeneous XX spin chains, highlighting results on perfect state transfer, out-of-equilibrium stationary dynamics in open systems, and entanglement and correlations in ground states. We discuss the conditions on couplings that enable perfect state transfer, examine how heat currents scale when the chains are coupled to thermal baths, explore the role of tridiagonal matrices in approximating the entanglement Hamiltonian and investigate bulk and boundary entanglement negativity and correlation decay. These findings underscore some of the distinctive physical behavior of inhomogeneous spin chains and their potential applications in quantum information and thermal transport.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of ecological structure and species rarity from fluctuating metabolic strategies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Zanchetta, Deepak Gupta, Sofia Moschin, Samir Suweis, Amos Maritan, Sandro Azaele</p>
            <p>Ecosystems frequently display the coexistence of diverse species under resource competition, typically resulting in skewed distributions of rarity and abundance. A potential driver of such coexistence is environmental fluctuations that favor different species over time. How to include and treat such temporal variability in existing consumer-resource models is still an open problem. In this work, we study correlated temporal fluctuations in species' resource uptake rates -- i.e. metabolic strategies -- within a stochastic consumer-resource framework. In a biologically relevant regime, we are able to find analytically the species abundance distributions through the path integral formalism. Our results reveal that stochastic dynamic metabolic strategies induce community structures that align more closely with empirical ecological observations. Within this framework, ecological communities show a higher diversity than expected under static competitive scenarios. We find that all species become extinct when the ratio of the number of species to the number of resources exceeds a critical threshold. Conversely, diversity peaks at intermediate values of the same ratio. Furthermore, when metabolic strategies of different species are different on average, maximal biodiversity is achieved for intermediate values of the amplitude of fluctuations. This work establishes a robust theoretical framework for exploring how temporal dynamics and stochasticity drive biodiversity and community structure.</p>

            <h2>Benchmarking a Tunable Quantum Neural Network on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina, Xingxin Liu, Richard Barney, Sarah H. Miller, Alaina M. Green, Norbert M. Linke, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum advantage.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometry of Altermagnetic Magnons Probed by Light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rundong Yuan, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Ka Shen, Robert-Jan Slager</p>
            <p>Magnons with momentum-dependent chirality are a key signature of altermagnets. We identify bicircular light as a smoking-gun optical probe for chiral altermagnetic magnons, selectively targeting their quantum geometry induced by an alteration of magnonic chirality. We show that in $d$-wave altermagnets, under a canting magnetic field, the altermagnetic magnons realize a nontrivial quantum geometry, resulting in an enhancement of the nonlinear second-order light-magnon interactions. We find that the scattering of bicircular pulses probes the present magnon quantum geometry, even if the magnonic topology is trivial. Hence, our findings establish bicircular Raman response as an optical effect of choice to identify altermagnetic magnons. As such, we propose a universal experimental protocol to distinguish altermagnets from antiferromagnets by detecting their magnon chirality patterns with light, independently of the underlying magnon topology.</p>

            <h2>Impeded Bloch Oscillation and Nonreciprocal Landau-Zener Tunneling of Bose-Einstein Quantum Droplets in Optical Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Szu-Cheng Cheng, Yu-Wen Wang, Wen-Hsuan Kuan</p>
            <p>We investigate the nonlinear Bloch dynamics and Landau-Zener tunneling of quantum droplets in optical lattices, where the interplay between mean-field repulsion and beyond-mean-field attraction from Lee-Huang-Yang corrections introduces a localization impedance that inhibits dynamical dispersion. This self-stabilizing mechanism is crucial to droplet mobility and nonlinear dephasing under external driving. In the deep-lattice regime, simulation in tight-binding reduction reveals breathing modes, self-trapping, and nonlinear Bloch oscillations. In the shallow-lattice regime, we reformulate the problem in momentum space and map the dynamics onto a nonlinear two-level model with time-dependent detuning. The adiabatic spectrum features looped bands and multiple fixed points, parallelly captured by the phase-space structure through a classical Josephson analogy. Applying Hamilton-Jacobi theory, we quantify the tunneling probabilities and demonstrate nonreciprocal Landau-Zener tunneling. The transition probability from the lower to upper band differs from that of the reverse process, even under the same sweeping protocol. This asymmetry arises from nonlinearly induced band gap modulation, highlighting rich dynamical behavior beyond the linear and adiabatic regimes.</p>

            <p>The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is emerging as a powerful tool for imaging magnetic and electric signals at the microscale and below. However, most imaging demonstrations thus far have relied on costly, millimeter-sized bulk diamond substrates, which cannot be easily scaled or integrated with other materials. Here, we report a scalable method for fabricating NV-containing dense and homogenous fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) layers through electrostatic self-assembly and demonstrate the utility of the FND layers for magnetic imaging. We investigate the effect of FND concentration in suspension, substrate immersion time, and solvent pH on the FND density on the substrate. We identify optimized self-assembly conditions that maximize the FND density while minimizing aggregation. Using FND layers on a quartz substrate, we demonstrate magnetic field and magnetic noise imaging at the microscale, based on NV optically detected magnetic resonance magnetometry and T$_1$ relaxometry, respectively. Our results provide a direction for the development of cost-effective and scalable FND layers and surface coatings. This paves the way for on-demand quantum sensing and imaging on a broad range of surfaces based on NV centers and other diamond quantum emitters.</p>

            <p>Quantum materials with bands of narrow bandwidth near the Fermi level represent a promising platform for exploring a diverse range of fascinating physical phenomena, as the high density of states within the small energy window often enables the emergence of many-body physics. On one hand, flat bands can arise from strong Coulomb interactions that localize atomic orbitals. On the other hand, quantum destructive interference can quench the electronic kinetic energy. Although both have a narrow bandwidth, the two types of flat bands should exhibit very distinct spectral properties arising from their distinctive origins. So far, the two types of flat bands have only been realized in very different material settings and chemical environments, preventing a direct comparison. Here, we report the observation of the two types of flat bands within the same material system--an above-room-temperature van der Waals ferromagnet, Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$, distinguishable by a switchable iron site order. The contrasting nature of the flat bands is also identified by the remarkably distinctive temperature-evolution of the spectral features, indicating that one arises from electron correlations in the Fe(1) site-disordered phase, while the other geometrical frustration in the Fe(1) site-ordered phase. Our results therefore provide a direct juxtaposition of the distinct formation mechanism of flat bands in quantum materials, and an avenue for understanding the distinctive roles flat bands play in the presence of magnetism, topology, and lattice geometrical frustration, utilizing sublattice ordering as a key control parameter.</p>

            <h2>Organic altermagnets based in two-dimensional nanographene frameworks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo Ortiz, Karol Strutyński, Manuel Melle-Franco</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism stands as a third type of collinear magnetic order, whose band structure combines a net zero magnetization with a non-relativistic spin-splitting caused by a broken time reversal symmetry. So far, the strategy to design platforms displaying altermagnetism has relied mostly on inorganic crystals with d-metals as spin centers, where a representative example is the two-dimensional square lattice with antiparallel D2h magnetic blocks related by a pi/2 rotation. Despite the fact that there is no strong requirement for the magnetic atoms to be metals, the construction of an altermagnetic framework with light elements like carbon is challenging due to symmetric constrictions. We show how it is possible to overcome this by including non-alternant rings in pi-conjugated nanographenes. More specifically, dibenzo[ef,kl]heptalene, an S = 1 pi-conjugated hydrocarbon consisting of a graph of two fused heptagons and hexagons, represents a suitable building block for an altermagnetic 2D crystal. In this work, we confirm this hypothesis with DFT calculations of the spin polarized band structure, presenting a spin compensated ground state with broken time reversal symmetry, and a d-wave symmetry of the first valence and conduction bands. Consistent results are obtained for covalent organic frameworks based on dibenzo[ef,kl]heptalene units connected by linkers, paving the way for the realization of organic altermagnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Light-induced coherent phonons provide a powerful platform for ultrafast control of material properties. However, the microscopic theory and quantum geometric nature of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical framework based on Feynman diagrams to systematically describe the generation of coherent phonons by light. We identify a dominant second-order, double-resonant process in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors that efficiently couples light to both electronic and phononic excitations. Crucially, we uncover the quantum geometric origin, encoded in the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) shift vector and the EPC quantum geometric tensor. Applying our theory to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and SnSe, we demonstrate the potential for light-induced modulation of ferroelectric polarization driven by coherent phonons. This work provides fundamental insights for designing efficient optical control strategies for both coherent phonons and ferroelectric polarization.</p>

            <p>We investigate the realization and control of subgap states by tailored altermagnetic fields on unconventional superconductors. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that the altermagnetism-induced subgap states give rise to a large spin conductance at zero net magnetization which helps identify the strength of the underlying altermagnetism and superconductivity. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Chen, Fangyang Zhan, Da-Shuai Ma, Dong-Hui Xu, Rui Wang</p>
            <p>Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states. Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.</p>

            <p>Exploring the intricate interplay between magnetism and charge density waves has long been a fundamental pursuit at the forefront of condensed matter research. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we propose for the first time that anomalous charge density wave can be realized in two-dimensional altermagnetic WO. The anomalous charge density wave is characterized by three key features: (i) Unlike conventional charge density wave, whose stabilization is driven by the opening of a gap near the Fermi level, the anomalous charge density wave is stabilized by the occupied states with energies shifting lower far away from the Fermi level; (ii) the anomalous charge density wave increases the density of states near the Fermi level and then enhances-rather than diminishes-the metallicity of materials; (iii) altermagnetism plays a crucial role in stabilizing anomalous charge density wave. Thus, our work offers a pathway for exploring both the realization and the underlying mechanisms of anomalous charge density waves in magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Light-induced Odd-parity Magnetism in Conventional Collinear Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengpu Huang, Zheng Qin, Fangyang Zhan, Dong-Hui Xu, Da-Shuai Ma, Rui Wang</p>
            <p>Recent studies have drawn growing attention on non-relativistic odd-parity magnetism in the wake of altermagnets. Nevertheless, odd-parity spin splitting is often believed to appear in non-collinear magnetic configurations. Here, using symmetry arguments and effective model analysis, we show that Floquet engineering offers a universal strategy for achieving odd-parity magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) collinear antiferromagnets under irradiation of periodic driving light fields such as circularly polarized light, elliptically polarized light, and bicircular light. A comprehensive classification of potential candidates for collinear monolayer or bilayer antiferromagnets is established. Strikingly, the light-induced odd-parity spin splitting can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the crystalline symmetry or the polarization state of incident light, enabling the reversal or conversion of spin-splitting. By combining first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we present illustrative examples of 2D collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials to verify the light-induced odd-parity magnetism. Our work not only offers a powerful approach for uniquely achieving odd-parity spin-splitting with high tunability, but also expands the potential of Floquet engineering in designing unconventional compensated magnetism.</p>

            <p>We develop a linear response theory for the dynamical proximity effect in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) hybrid structures. Our approach combines the nonequilibrium quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel equations for the electronic Green's functions in the TS with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation governing the magnetization dynamics in the FI. Within this framework, we study the proximity-induced coupling between magnons and superconducting collective excitations. We find that the spin-momentum locking intrinsic to the surface state of the TS leads to a hybridization between the superconducting Nambu-Goldstone (phase) collective mode and magnons, resulting in the emergence of composite magnon-Nambu-Goldstone excitations. The dependence of the coupling strength on relevant physical parameters is analyzed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, we show that the Higgs (amplitude) mode does not couple to magnons at linear order and therefore does not participate in the formation of hybrid collective excitations.</p>

            <p>We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</p>

While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillermo Parra-Martínez, Alejandro Jimeno-Pozo, Jose Angel Silva-Guillén, Francisco Guinea</p>
            <p>Rhombohedral graphene systems with different number of layers feature an abundance of correlated phases and superconducting states in experimental measurements with different doping and displacement fields. Some of the superconducting pockets can emerge from - or close to - one of the correlated states. Therefore, studying the phase diagram of the correlated phases for varying number of layers could be useful to interpret the experimental observations. To achieve this, systematic Hartree-Fock calculations have been performed to build the phase diagram of rhombohedral (ABC-stacked) graphene for different number of layers, in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. By varying the external displacement field and carrier density, a cascade of metallic partially-isospin-polarized phases that spontaneously break spin and/or valley (flavor) symmetries is found. In addition, these states can present nematicity, stabilized by electron-electron interactions, exhibiting rich internal complexity. Polarized states are more stable for electron doping, and they are found for systems with up to 20 layers. Moreover, the tunability of the phase diagram via substrate screening and spin-orbit coupling proximity effects has been studied. Our results offer new insights into the role of correlations and symmetry breaking in graphitic systems which will motivate future experimental and theoretical works.</p>

The hysteresis loop exhibits a sharp onset under low temperatures and evolves symmetrically relative to the charge transfer equilibrium.

            <h2>Magnetism at the interface of $MoSe_2/V_2O_5$ heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohin Sharma, Diem Thi-Xuan Dang, Lilia M. Woods</p>
            <p>Magnetism in doped transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers and van der Waals interfaced materials have motivated the search for sustainable magnetic states at the nanoscale with the prospect of building devices for spintronics applications. In this study, we report the existence of magnetism in a heterostructure made up of an $MoSe_2$ transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer and a $V_2O_5$ substrate. Using density functional theory simulations, we find that ferromagnetic ordering can be found in the $MoSe_2/V_2O_5$ heterostructure even though the individual components are nonmagnetic. By examining the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this system we find how the occurring ferromagnetism evolves if the transition metal dichalcogenide or the $V_2O_5$ substrate can host point defects. Our study suggests that the balance between charge transfer and spin reorganization can lead to interface magnetism in novel hybrid materials.</p>

            <h2>Sliding two-dimensional superconductivity and charge-density-wave state in a bulk crystal</h2>

            <p>Superconductivity in the two-dimensional (2D) limit is a fertile ground for exotic quantum phenomena-many of which remain elusive in their 3D counterparts. While studies of 2D superconductivity have predominantly focused on mono- or few-layer systems, we demonstrate an alternative route-interlayer sliding in bulk crystals. Through a precisely controlled growth strategy, we engineer interlayer sliding in bulk 3R-NbSe2, deliberately disrupting [001] mirror symmetry and drastically suppressing interlayer coupling. Remarkably, this structural manipulation stabilizes Ising-type superconductivity coexisting with an unconventional charge-density-wave (CDW) state akin to that of monolayer 2H-NbSe2. The sliding phase exhibits a pronounced suppression of the upper critical field at low temperatures, revealing a delicate competition between Ising and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the globally noncentrosymmetric lattice. Intriguingly, the superconducting state displays two-fold symmetry, a signature that may arise from asymmetric SOC or a multi-component pairing order parameter. Our work establishes interlayer sliding as a symmetry-breaking tool to promote 2D superconductivity in bulk materials-without resorting to extrinsic intercalation or doping. More broadly, this approach sets a paradigm for unlocking hidden quantum states in layered materials, offering a new dimension in design of quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Opto- and magneto-tunable exceptional degeneracies in non-Hermitian ferromagnet/$p$-wave magnet junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Alipourzadeh, Davood Afshar, Yaser Hajati</p>
            <p>Unconventional $p$-wave magnets (UPMs) with odd-parity spin textures have attracted interest for their zero net magnetization and anisotropic spin-split Fermi surfaces. Here, we explore a non-Hermitian open quantum system composed of a ferromagnet and a UPM, subjected to an external magnetic field and off-resonant circularly polarized light (CPL), serving as tunable control parameters. We demonstrate the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the proposed junction, whose locations can be modulated by the intrinsic properties of the UPM. These EPs exhibit different multiplicities and formation conditions compared to those in even-parity magnets (dubbed $d$- wave altermagnets), a distinction attributable to the preserved time-reversal and broken inversion symmetries characteristic of UPMs. We find that both the unidirectional magnetic field (with adjustable strength and orientation) and the CPL induce momentum-direction-dependent modifications to the EPs, such as their shifting, tilting, merging, or annihilation, supported by analyses of spin projection and eigenvector overlap. Although both perturbations influence the EP structure, they operate via distinct mechanisms: CPL induces a global Floquet re-normalization, enabling dynamic tunability through light, whereas the unidirectional magnetic field selectively alters orientation-aligned terms, lacking such tunability. Beyond revealing EP dynamics in UPM-based junctions, our results highlight UPMs as promising platforms for non-Hermitian phenomena in future spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Using surface plasmons to detect spin inertia</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. Y. Yuan</p>
            <p>Recent experiments demonstrate that spin dynamics may acquire an inertial effect in a few metallic magnets, deviating from the traditional inertia-free dynamics. It remains an open question to ascertain the physical mechanisms and universality of the spin inertia across diverse magnetic systems. Here, we show that spin inertia generates nutation spin waves in the terahertz regime, which can hybridize with the surface plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) conducting materials such as graphene. By exciting hybrid spin wave-plasmon modes and analyzing the reflection spectrum of a 2D material$|$magnet heterostructure, we propose a method to quantitatively determine the strength of spin inertia in magnetic layers. Our approach is universally applicable to all types of magnetic insulators and could advance the future exploration of the magnitude and physical mechanism of spin inertia.</p>

            <p>By exciting the transverse breathing mode of an elongated Bose-Einstein condensate, we parametrically produce longitudinal collective excitations in a pairwise manner. This process also referred to as Faraday wave generation, can be seen as an analog to cosmological particle production. Building upon single particle detection, we investigate the early time dynamics of the exponential growth and compare our observation with a Bogoliubov description. The growth rate we observe experimentally is in very good agreement with theoretical predictions, demonstrating the validity of the Bogoliubov description and thereby confirming the smallness of quasiparticle interactions in such an elongated gas. We also discuss the presence of oscillations in the atom number, which are due to pair correlations and to the rate at which interactions are switched off.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Remy Adderton, Murray T. Batchelor</p>
            <p>The Hamiltonian of the $N$-state clock model is written in terms of a coupled Temperley-Lieb (TL) algebra defined by $N-1$ types of TL generators. This generalizes a previous result for $N=3$ obtained by J. F. Fjelstad and T. Månsson [J. Phys. A {\bf 45} (2012) 155208]. The $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric clock chain Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the coupled TL algebra generalizes the well known correspondence between the $N$-state Potts model and the TL algebra. The algebra admits a pictorial description in terms of a planar algebra involving parafermionic operators attached to $n$ strands. A key ingredient in the resolution of diagrams is the string Fourier transform. The pictorial presentation also allows a description of the Hilbert space. We also give a pictorial description of the representation related to the staggered XX spin chain. Just as the pictorial representation of the TL algebra has proven to be particularly useful in providing a visual and intuitive way to understand and manipulate algebraic expressions, it is anticipated that the pictorial representation of the coupled TL algebra may lead to further progress in understanding various aspects of the $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ clock model, including the superintegrable chiral Potts model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tista Banerjee</p>
            <p>Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are versatile testbeds to study and manipulate equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium aspects of quantum many-body systems whose behavior can be described by Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. In this paper, we consider an ansatz wave-function which respects total particle-number conservation for such systems and goes beyond mean-field theory; this wave-function has the same complexity in the number of parameters as the mean-field Gutzwiller ansatz, and captures quantum correlations and entanglement via projection onto an effective low-energy manifold. This ansatz can be exploited to study quantum phases observed in a large class of systems realizable in such experimental platforms and is useful to study quantum dynamics. We show that the relaxation dynamics of various out-of-equilibrium initial states under sudden quench of Hamiltonian parameters can be studied with this ansatz wavefunction within the framework of time-dependent variational principle. We present a quantitative comparison with small-scale exact diagonalization results in the 1D Bose-Hubbard model with and without external trapping potentials.</p>

            <h2>A Novel Methodology of Visualizing Orthorhombic Phase Uniformity in Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Devices Using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Cheng Peng, Hsien-Yang Liu, Cheng-Yu Yu, Artur Useinov, Tian-Li Wu</p>
            <p>Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films are promising for next-generation memory and logic devices due to their CMOS compatibility and scalability. The spatial uniformity of the orthorhombic (O) phase is crucial for optimizing ferroelectric properties like remnant polarization. This work introduces a novel piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) approach for 2D mapping of O-phase uniformity in HZO films (5 nm, 9 nm, and 20 nm), further quantifing O-phase distribution by distinguishing polarized O-phase regions from non-polarized tetragonal/monoclinic (T/M) phases. Our results reveal that the 9 nm film exhibits the most uniform O-phase and highest remnant polarization. This PFM-based method enables comprehensive phase characterization without requiring complicated facilities, broadening access to phase analysis and advancing ferroelectric thin-film research for memory and logic applications.</p>

A class 3B diode laser was used to induce the transition under controlled irradiation conditions. Structural characterization was achieved through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) measurements post-irradiation, revealing significant changes in average Fe-N distances, consistent with SCO behavior. Our experimental setup enables precise alignment necessary for photo-excitation using a class 3B diode laser along with a compact focusing optics. The longest dimension of the combined setup of the diode head and the focusing optics is not more than 32cm. The setup showcasing the utility of a compact diode laser system which can even be conveniently used in synchrotron-based pump-probe photocrystallography experiments for a wide range of molecular crystals.</p>

            <p>We present absorption coefficient {\alpha}({\omega}), transverse dielectric function {\epsilon}({\omega}), optical conductivity {\sigma}({\omega}), and reflectance R({\omega}) calculated for an emeraldine salt conducting polymer in its crystalline three-dimensional polaronic structure. We utilize Kohn-Sham DFT electronic wavefunctions and energies implemented in the expression of the macroscopic transverse dielectric function in the framework of the band theory without the electron-hole interaction. Contributions of intra-band transitions are taken into account by adding a Drude-like term to the dielectric function calculated ab-initio. Comparison with optical properties, recently measured on high-quality emeraldine salts (Nature 441(2006)65-68), and with optical absorption spectra, recorded on other emeraldine salts, is very satisfactory. The calculated spectra are discussed in terms of energy-band structure, density of states, inter- and intra-band transitions and transverse dielectric function.</p>

            <h2>Supercurrents and tunneling in massive many-vortex necklaces and star-lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alice Bellettini, Vittorio Penna</p>
            <p>Recently, cold atoms mixtures have attracted broad interest due to their novel properties and exotic quantum effects with respect to single-component systems. In this paper the focus is on massive many-vortex states and their dynamics. Vortex configurations characterized by the same discrete rotational symmetry are investigated when confined within topologically nonequivalent geometries, and the relative stability properties at varying number of vortices and infilling mass are highlighted. It is numerically shown how massive many-vortex systems, in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates, can host the bosonic tunneling of the infilling component both in a disordered way, with tunneling events involving two or more close vortices, or in an almost-periodic way when the vortices are organized in persisting necklaces or star-lattices. The purpose is to explore a variety of situations involving the interplay between the highly-nonlinear vortex dynamics and the inter-vortex atomic transfer, and so to better understand the conditions for the onset of Josephson supercurrents in rotating systems, or to reveal phenomena that could be of interest for a future application e.g. in the context of atomtronics.</p>

            <p>The multiple crystalline terminations in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ display distinct topological and trivial surface states, which have successfully been distinguished experimentally. However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered tin termination with a varying density of surface tin-vacancies. Finally, we show how a combination of algorithmic and machine learning analysis of photoemission data can be used to extract identifying features, classify spatial regions, and correlate local chemistry with local electronic structure.</p>

            <p>Low temperature transport measurements are presented of ferromagnetic MnSb devices with the magnetic properties patterned using a Ga focused ion beam FIB system at 30 keV. FIB patterning introduces disorder and this is quantified in this paper through measurements of the longitudinal resistivity and the anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity. The MnSb structural phase is the niccolite phase with a surface state in addition to bulk states. FIB doses up to 1E16 Ga ions per square cm reduces the anisotropic magnetoresistance signal but increases the size of the anomalous Hall effect signal in out of plane magnetic fields, B. The anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity is e squared divided by h in the undamaged devices, where e is the electronic charge and h is Plancks constant. This quantity is sensitive to the level of disorder induced by the Ga ion beam, reducing to zero at dose levels greater than 1E16 Ga ions per square cm. The resistivity shows a logarithmic B dependence after the magnetization has saturated with the low field anisotropic magnetoresistance contribution of 0.12 percent. The conductivity change is e squared divided by h in the magnetic field range of logarithmic B behavior. The resistivity shows a reduced fit to a logarithmic B dependence at high FIB dose levels and is dependent on the damage uniformity. Patterning nanostructured magnetic behavior in MnSb, with compatibility to altermagnetic materials, in particular the niccolite phase of CrSb and non trivial Berry phase contributions to transport make this ferromagnetic material and patterning technique useful for future spintronic device development.</p>

            <p>Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a leading platform in the delivery of RNA-based therapeutics, playing a pivotal role in the clinical success of mRNA vaccines and other nucleic acid drugs. Their performance in RNA encapsulation and delivery is critically governed by the molecular structure of ionizable lipids and the overall formulation composition. However, mechanistic insight into how these factors govern LNP architecture and function remains limited, primarily owing to the challenges of capturing nanoscale assembly and organization using experimental techniques. Here, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate how ionizable lipid chemistry influences LNP self-assembly, internal organization, and surface properties. We further explore the effects of formulation ratios and pH-dependent deprotonation on both the internal structure and surface morphology of LNPs. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate how in silico structural characteristics can inform the rational design of novel ionizable lipids and optimization of formulation ratios, supported with experimental validations. Our findings offer a molecular-level understanding of LNP assembly dynamics and architecture, thereby establishing a computational framework linking lipid chemistry and LNP formulation to the structure and performance of LNP, to advance the rational design of novel LNP delivery systems.</p>

            <h2>Self-organisation -- the underlying principle and a general model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Blumenfeld</p>
            <p>Recent observations of coordinated self-organisation (SO) of stress and structure in granular systems provide insight into the fundamental principle underlying this phenomenon. It is first argued here that SO emerges when a minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p>This study integrates a data-driven model for estimating the unfrozen water content into the thermo-hydraulic coupling simulation of frozen soils. An artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to develop this data-driven model using a dataset from the literature. Thereafter, a numerical algorithm was developed to implement the data-driven model into the thermo-hydraulic simulation. In the numerical algorithm, the frozen and unfrozen zones are distinguished first according to the freezing temperature, where the unfrozen water at frozen nodes is updated using the ANN model. Subsequently, discretized hydraulic and thermal equations are solved sequentially and iteratively using Newton-Raphson method until the temperature and unfrozen water content satisfy the tolerance simultaneously. Horizontal and vertical freezing experiments are used to verify the reliability of the proposed algorithm. The computed variations in temperature, total water, unfrozen water, and ice content achieve good agreements with measured data. Some key features of frozen soils, such as water migration and ice formation, and the increase in total water content, are reproduced by the developed algorithm. Additionally, the comparison between the ANN model and existing empirical equations for determining unfrozen water content demonstrates that the ANN model offers a better performance.</p>

            <p>This study presents a simple theoretical model describing narrow envelope surface acoustic waves (phonons) and spin waves (magnons) in an ultrathin ferromagnetic film. Based on the general principles of weak wave turbulence, the model considers interactions between beams of an ideal phonon gas and a weakly non-ideal magnon gas, which represent magnetoacoustic oscillations in the system. Equations for the wave envelopes of phonons and magnons, along with their harmonics, are derived, incorporating nonlinear effects from three- and four-particle interactions. In the general non-resonant case, linear stationary envelope simulations are sufficient. These clarify the experimentally observed angular dependence of the transmitted acoustic signal with respect to the orientation of the magnetic field. The study highlights increased energy losses associated with enhanced magnetoacoustic coupling. Given the broad interdisciplinary interest in weak turbulence phenomena within condensed matter physics and nonlinear wave dynamics, our model offers significant predictive capabilities and greatly simplifies calculations of quasiparticle beam interactions.</p>

            <p>Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are exceptionally sensitive magnetometers capable of detecting weak magnetic fields. Miniaturizing these devices and integrating them onto scanning probes enables high-resolution imaging at low-temperature. Here, we fabricate nanometer-scale niobium SQUIDs with inner-loop sizes down to 10 nm at the apex of individual planar silicon cantilevers via a combination of wafer-scale optical lithography and focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling. These robust SQUID-on-lever probes overcome many of the limitations of existing devices, achieving spatial resolution better than 100 nm, magnetic flux sensitivity of $0.3~\mu\Phi_0/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$, and operation in magnetic fields up to about 0.5 T at 4.2 K. Nanopatterning via Ne- or He-FIB allows for the incorporation of a modulation line for coupling magnetic flux into the SQUID or a third Josephson junction for shifting its phase. Such advanced functionality, combined with high spatial resolution, large magnetic field range, and the ease of use of a cantilever-based scanning probe, extends the applicability of scanning SQUID microscopy to a wide range of magnetic, normal conducting, superconducting, and quantum Hall systems. We demonstrate magnetic imaging of skyrmions at the surface of bulk Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Analysis of the point spread function determined from imaging a single skyrmion yields a full-width-half-maximum of 87 nm. Moreover, we image modulated magnetization patterns with a period of 65 nm.</p>

            <p>Adding spin-polarized carriers to semiconductor lasers strongly changes their properties and, through the transfer of angular momentum, leads to the emission of the circularly polarized light. In such spin-lasers the polarization of the emitted light can be modulated an order of magnitude faster than its intensity in the best conventional lasers. This ultrafast operation in spin-lasers relies on the large linear birefringence, usually viewed as detrimental in spin and conventional lasers, which couples the two linearly-polarized emission modes. We show that the dynamical properties of birefringent spin-lasers under intensity and polarization modulation are accurately described as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our model agrees with the intensity-equation description which, unlike the common complex field components describing the role of birefringence in laser dynamics, uses simpler real quantities and allows analytical solutions. We further predict unexplored operation regimes and elucidate the difference between the weak and strong coupling in spin-lasers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Cardoso, Erlend Syljuåsen, Alexander V. Balatsky</p>
            <p>We report two light-induced orbital magnetization effects in quantum Hall (QH) fluids, stemming from their transverse response. The first is a purely transverse contribution to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), where circularly polarized light induces a DC magnetization by stirring the charged fluid. This contribution dominates the IFE in the QH regime. The second is the orbital inverse Cotton-Mouton effect (ICME), in which linearly polarized light generates a DC magnetization. Since the applied field in the ICME does not break time-reversal symmetry, the induced magnetization directly probes the chiral orbital response of the fluid at the driving frequency. We estimate that the resulting magnetization lies in the range of 0.5-10 Bohr magnetons per charge carrier in materials such as graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the QH regime. Finally, we show that the induced magnetization is accompanied by a local correction to the static particle density, enabling optical quantum printing of density profiles into the QH fluid.</p>

            <h2>From trigonal to triclinic: Symmetry-tuned Rashba effects in buckled honeycomb SrHfO$_{3}$-based heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Okan Köksal</p>
            <p>Harnessing the interplay of symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling, we investigate Rashba spin splitting in buckled honeycomb (SrHfO$_3$)$_2$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_4$(111) superlattices using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term and a Wannier-based tight-binding (TB) model. In the non-centrosymmetric $P1$ phase, pronounced Rashba-type splitting emerges near the $M$ and $K$ points accompanied by a helical in-plane spin texture, while the centrosymmetric $P321$ phase remains spin-degenerate. A Wannier-based tight-binding Hamiltonian, extended analytically with on-site spin-orbit coupling, reproduces the DFT results. A Rashba coefficient of $\alpha_R = 0.34$ eV$ \cdot$ Angstrom and energy $E_R = 29$ meV are extracted directly from the DFT band structure placing the system among moderately strong oxide Rashba materials. $\Gamma$-phonon calculation confirms the dynamical stability of the $P1$ structure and the results reveal the critical role of symmetry breaking and inter-orbital hybridization in enabling Rashba effects, supported by enhanced imaginary second-nearest-neighbor hoppings and Berry curvature. These findings establish SrHfO$_3$-based buckled heterostructures as a promising platform for engineering Rashba effects in oxide-based spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Benchmarking total energies with Hund's J terms in Hubbard-corrected spin-crossover chemistry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lórien MacEnulty, João Paulo Almeida de Mendonça, Roberta Poloni, David D. O'Regan</p>
            <p>The effect of the Hund's J terms in various DFT+U+J corrections to semi-local spin-density functional theory is assessed for a series of four octahedrally coordinated Fe(II) spin-crossover molecules spanning the covalent end of the ligand field spectrum. We report values and analyze trends for the Hubbard U and Hund's J parameters determined via minimum-tracking linear response for all valence atomic subspaces and relevant spin states in these molecules. We then methodically apply them via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard functionals in search of the simplest combination to yield reliable adiabatic energy differences with respect to those obtained using CASPT2/CC. The observed failure of canonical, positively-signed Hund's J terms in furthering the already robust capacity of DFT+U to obtain accurate energetics prompts an evaluation of their limitations when seeking to account for the static correlation phenomena in such strongly covalent systems and suggests directions for their improvement.</p>

            <h2>Topological phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking: the revenge of the original Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Polina Matveeva, Dmitri Gutman, Sam T. Carr</p>
            <p>We study the interplay of spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological properties in interacting one-dimensional models. We solve these models using bozonization and identify topologically non-trivial phases by counting the additional degeneracy (affiliated with the edge modes) of a finite-size system relative to the infinite one. We find even if the mean-field solution is topological, this may not be true when it arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking, including in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This implies that the original SSH model, as presented by Su, Schrieffer, and Heeger, is topologically trivial, as opposed to its mean-field version. A spinful version, on the other hand, does exhibit a topologically non-trivial phase. In that state, both mean-field solutions are topologically non-trivial and correspond to non-interacting SSH chains in the opposite phases with the winding number $\nu=1$. We show that this phase is protected by a chiral symmetry, similar to the non-interacting phases.</p>

            <h2>Path-Integral Formulation of Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Monte Carlo stochastic trajectories using the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q Functions and Hybrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toma Yoneya, Kazuya Fujimoto, Yuki Kawaguchi</p>
            <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability, which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral, and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.</p>

            <h2>Significant Mobility Enhancement in Coupled AlGaN/GaN Quantum Wells considering Inter-Well Distance and Asymmetric Widths</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Le Tri Dat, Tran Trong Tai, Truong Van Tuan, Vo Van Tai, Nguyen Duy Vy</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that coupled AlGaN/GaN quantum wells with asymmetric widths ($L_1-L_2<30 $ A achieve up to 4.5 times higher mobility than single wells at optimal separation (d = 100 A). Crucially, mobility surpasses single wells when d>40 A reversing the trend at smaller distances. This enhancement stems from double-layer screening that suppresses remote/background impurities and dislocations, while LO phonon scattering remains unaffected. For identical wells, coupled systems underperform single wells at d<40 A but exceed them beyond this threshold. Peak gains occur at cryogenic temperatures (77 K). Our results provide a robust theoretical framework to optimize mobility in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, reducing experimental trial-and-error in quantum device engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Bin Qiang, Tianyu Liu, Zi-Xuan Gao, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>Over the years, Berry curvature, which is associated with the imaginary part of the quantum geometric tensor, has profoundly impacted many branches of physics. Recently, quantum metric, the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, has been recognized as indispensable in comprehensively characterizing the intrinsic properties of condensed matter systems. The intrinsic second-order nonlinear conductivity induced by the quantum metric has attracted significant recent interest. However, its expression varies across the literature. Here, we reconcile this discrepancy by systematically examining the nonlinear conductivity using the standard perturbation theory, the wave packet dynamics, and the Luttinger-Kohn approach. Moreover, inspired by the Dirac model, we propose a toy model that suppresses the Berry-curvature-induced nonlinear transport, making it suitable for studying the quantum-metric-induced nonlinear conductivity. Our theory can be further extended to include disorder effects and higher-order quantum geometric contributions, paving the way for a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of nonlinear transport.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-adapted models for multifold fermions with spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koki Satow, Ai Yamakage</p>
            <p>Multifold fermions, quasiparticles with multiple degeneracy protected by crystalline symmetries, exhibit a variety of intriguing phenomena stemming from their large topological charges and unique band structures. A comprehensive understanding of their response to external stimuli remains challenging, especially for types protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries where various degrees of freedom are intricately coupled. Here, we systematically construct effective models for multifold fermions that incorporate external fields based on crystalline symmetry. Specifically, we develop a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{p}$ model for the threefold fermion protected by space group I2$_1$3 (No.~199) in the presence of spin--orbit coupling, and derive the terms for external fields. By complementing this with a tight-binding model, we investigate the magnetic field response and reveal the pair annihilation of magnetic monopoles. Furthermore, we construct a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{p}$ model for the eightfold fermion in space group P$\bar{4}3n1'$ (No.~218), including its coupling to external fields. This work provides a robust theoretical foundation for advancing the study of external field responses and transport phenomena in multifold fermions, opening new avenues to explore their rich physics.</p>

            <p>This paper presents the possibility for inertial imaging of spatially patterned annular mass distributions of a circular graphene nanodrum resonator. By placing two distinct analytes in concentric annular regions, we harness the vibrational mode-specific sensitivities of the nanodrum to estimate their respective mass densities. An analytical formulation based on the Rayleigh-Ritz principle is developed to relate radial mass loading to modal frequency shifts. Finite element simulations are performed in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the shifts in the resonance frequency of vibrational modes under varying geometrical configurations of annular rings. By processing these frequency shifts through a transformation matrix, we estimate the concomitant mass distributions of annular rings. The results indicate that the estimation errors are lower for analytes placed near the antinodal regions of the dominant vibration mode, with the lowest error being 1.82 % for analyte A and 2.03 % for analyte B. Furthermore, thinner annular rings demonstrate enhanced detection accuracy due to reduced modal overlap. This study demonstrates an analytical strategy for mass detection using a graphene nanodrum by providing insights into optimal analyte placement and structural design for high-precision multi-target mass sensing applications.</p>

            <h2>Reducing critical current for spin-transfer-torque-induced magnetization reversal in CPP-GMR devices: effect of low damping and enhanced spin scattering asymmetry in $Co_2FeGa_{0.5}Ge_{0.5}$ Heusler alloy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vineet Barwal, Hirofumi Suto, Yuya Sakuraba</p>
            <p>Spin-transfer torque (STT) in magnetoresistance devices has enabled key applications such as STT-magnetoresistive random access memory, spin torque oscillators, and energy-assisted magnetic recording. In the device structures, where a free layer (FL) magnetization is manipulated by spin injection from a spin injection layer (SIL), the critical current density required for operation is directly proportional to the damping ($\alpha$) constant of FL and inversely proportional to the STT efficiency, which depends on the spin polarization ($P$) of the materials. Here, we investigate the effect of low $\alpha$ and high $P$ of $Co_2FeGa_{0.5}Ge_{0.5}$(CFGG) Heusler alloy on the operation current required for STT-induced magnetization reversal in current perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistance devices. Devices with CFGG as a FL material achieved a large reduction in the operation current, as compared to those with conventional NiFe-FL owing to the very low $\alpha$ of CFGG, demonstrating the advantage of CFGG as a FL material. As the advantage of high spin polarization CFGG for SIL, we analyzed the effect of bilayer SIL consisting of CoFe and thin CFGG layers, focusing on utilizing the spin scattering asymmetry at the CoFe/CFGG interface. Devices with the CoFe/CFGG-SIL exhibited the lowest critical current, demonstrating enhanced STT efficiency. In addition, the correlation of STT efficiency with magnetoresistance ratio were comprehensively investigated, showing that device-to-device distribution in STT-efficiency was smaller in CoFe/CFGG-SIL. These findings highlight the potential of CFGG Heusler alloy and CoFe/CFGG bilayer structures as key components for the development of efficient and stable STT-based spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Recent developments dedicated to the building of multiscale mechanical and chemical constitutive laws for energetic molecular crystals are presented and discussed. In particular, various tools have been specifically incorporated in molecular dynamics codes to facilitate the subsequent information transfer to the continuum, i.e. finite elements simulation codes. Atomistic simulations have been augmented with the capability to follow specific deformation paths as well as local Lagrangian mechanical metrics, enabling the computation of materials flow stress surface. This mechanistic library allowed the construction of a comprehensive non-linear hyperelastic continuum model including crystal plasticity and twinning for TATB. Besides, recent advances in analyzing reactive molecular dynamics simulations with unsupervised learning algorithms has enabled the identification and calibration of chemical decomposition kinetics for RDX and TATB single crystal. In the present work, the procedure is applied to $\beta$-HMX and extended with the calibration of a multi-components equation of state. These two ingredients are implemented in a finite-element code in order to model the shock-to-detonation transition at the mesoscale level and to study dimensionality effects in quasi-static hotspots. Finally, these dedicated efforts towards a comprehensive multiscale modeling of explosives has also given rise to the need for new prospective experiments, discussed throughout the paper.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Svane, Kim-Khuong Huynh, Yong P. Chen, Bo Brummerstedt Iversen</p>
            <p>InSe is a van der Waals semiconductor in which mechanical flexibility, high electronic mobility, and non-trivial electronic structures converge, making it an attractive platform for both intriguing fundamental studies and promising device developments. However, the nucleation and growth of phase-pure, intrinsic InSe crystals require stringent thermodynamical conditions, and have therefore remained elusive. Since InSe melts incongruently, the widely used synthesis methods based on cooling of a 1:1 In-Se mixture will produce either aggregates of multiphase crystallites or uncontrolled In-rich, heavily electron-doped InSe. This fundamental thermodynamic constraint provides a compelling explanation for the large discrepancies observed in the reported physical properties of InSe. We overcome these limitations by utilizing the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method to produce high quality, centimeter-size InSe single crystals. Electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric transport measurements demonstrate that TSFZ-InSe single crystals closely approach the intrinsic limit, establishing it as a benchmark material for the future studies of this important material.</p>

Here, we present 4-(4'-nitrophenylazo)diphenylamine (NDPA) and its derivative, novel nonlinear optical molecular crystals discovered through materials screening incorporating crystal habit prediction. They demonstrate crystallization into high-quality aligned thin films and ultrafine silicon slot fillings through the capillary action of melts. The resulting EO performance much exceed that of conventional lithium niobate and are comparable to state-of-the-art EO polymers, with excellent thermal stability maintained for over 1000 hours at 393 K. The present EO materials satisfying all the requirements above are promising candidates for silicon-organic hybrid optical modulators, opening a significant step toward scalable and high-performance optoelectronic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of charged solid-liquid interfaces with different water models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahdi Tavakol, Kislon Voïtchovsky</p>
            <p>Aqueous solid-liquid interfaces (SLI) are ubiquitous in nature and technology, often hosting molecular-level processes with macroscopic consequences. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a tool of choice to investigate interfacial phenomena with atomistic precision, but there exists a large number of water models, each optimised for a different purpose. Here we compare the ability of common water models to accurately simulate the interface between a charged silica surface and an aqueous solution containing NaCl. We first compare the bulk dielectric constant of water and its dependence on salt concentration for SPC/Fw, SPC/e, TIPS3p, H2O/DC, TIP3P-Fw, OPC3, TIP3P, TIP3P-FB, TIP3P-ST, FBA/e, and TIPS3p-PPPM, revealing large variations between models. Simulating the interface with silica for the most suitable water models (SPC/Fw, H2O/DC, TIP3-ST and TIPS3p-PPPM) show some intrinsic consistency with continuum predictions (Poisson-Boltzmann) whereby the free energy minima obtained from MD and the analytical model are in agreement, provided the latter includes the MD-determined total charge of ions in the Stern layer and dielectric constant. This consistency stands even for water models with a dielectric constant off by 10%. For salt concentrations higher than 0.21 M NaCl, the formation of random ion-ion pairs limits the reproducibility of the MD results and the applicability of the analytical method. The results highlight the applicability of the analytical model down to the nanoscale, provided a priory knowledge of the Stern layer charge is available. The findings could have significant implications for MD simulations of SLIs, especially at charged or electrified interfaces.</p>

            <p>Since the pioneering work Lohani et. al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 041063 (2019), it became clear that quantum skyrmions have highly unusual properties as compared to the classical skyrmions and, due to their quantumness, cannot be described by continuous magnetic textures akin to the classical skyrmions. Competing nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in triangular spin-frustrated magnets lead to the formation of quantum skyrmion states. In frustrated magnets, skyrmions are characterized by the helical degree of freedom, which can store quantum information. In the limit of a weak electric field, the system can be described as a two-level system, i.e., a skyrmion qubit. Here, we propose a more general formulation of the problem and obtain general analytic solution of the model previously introduced in Psaroudaki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 067201 (2021). Our solution is valid not only for small barrier but for the arbitrary electric field. In the case of a significant barrier, we prove that the system's state is not a Skyrmion qubit as it was thought before, but a Skyrmion qudit. We constructed the density matrix of the Skyrmion qudit and studied its evolution in time. The obtained results suggest that the proposed model can be exploited further to meet the needs of quantum information theory and quantum skyrmionics. We showed that the $l_1$ norm of coherence of the skyrmion quantum qudit is a thousand times larger than the coherence of the skyrmion quantum qubit. The obtained result opens new perspectives for quantum skyrmion-based resource theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolo Tormena, Teuta Pilizota, Kislon Voïtchovsky</p>
            <p>Biological membranes are complex, dynamic structures essential for cellular compartmentalization, signaling, and mechanical integrity. The molecular organization of eukaryotic membranes has been extensively studied, including the lipid raft-mediated lateral organization and the influence of the specific molecular interactions. Bacterial membranes were traditionally viewed as compositionally simpler and structurally uniform. Recent evidence, however, reveals that they possess significant lipid diversity and can form functional microdomains reminiscent of eukaryotic lipid rafts, despite lacking sterols and sphingolipids. Yet, the impact of unspecific physical contacts on the local molecular organization and evolution of the prokaryotic membranes remains poorly understood. Here we use a model lipid membrane mimicking the composition of Escherichia coli's inner membrane to investigate the impact of contacting substrates on the membrane nanoscale evolution, when close to its transition temperature, $T_m$. As expected, the presence of a substrate lowers the $T_m$ by $\sim$10 °C and induces a differential leaflet transition. However, it also slows down the phase transition kinetics by almost 2 orders of magnitude while simultaneously enabling a spinodal-like lateral molecular reorganization. This creates local alterations of the phase of the membrane, with the emergence of mechanically stiffer, yet still fluid nanodomains evolving over substrate-dependent timescales, consistent with a substrate-biased lipid flip-flop mechanism. The results verify previous theoretical predictions and demonstrate that a general physical mechanism -- driven by membrane-surface interactions -- can spontaneously induce lipid domain formation in bacterial membranes. This is bound to have notable consequences for its function and mechanical role, including in processes like osmotic pressure regulation.</p>

Transverse to the sawtooth chains, INS reveals two dispersive spin-wave modes and a gap of at least 0.75 meV. This behavior is rationalized within a zigzag-chain model of Cu(2) spins in an effective magnetic field of Cu(1) spins. The model is compatible with first-principles calculations and accounts for INS dispersions within linear spin-wave theory calculations. Our results reveal a unique case of an effective separation of energy scales between two differently oriented one-dimensional chains, with the zigzag-chain model being essential to fully characterize atacamite's low-energy magnetism.</p>

            <p>In recent years, significant effort has been devoted to developing smart materials whose mechanical properties can adapt under physical stimuli. Particulate colloidal gels, which behave as solids but can also flow under stress, have emerged as promising candidates. Resulting from the attractive interaction between their constituents, their network architecture exhibit solid-like properties even at very low volume fractions. This structural flexibility allows them to adopt various configurations and store structural information making them highly susceptible to memory effects. Shear flow, applied through rheometry, offers a simple and effective way to tune their properties and imprint a ``rheological memory'' of the flow history. However, the precise relationship between flow history and viscoelastic response remains elusive, largely due to the limited structural characterization of these systems during flow and after flow cessation. Here, we use ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) to reveal a strong structural memory in the solid state, where the microstructure formed under shear is retained after flow cessation. We identify two distinct mechanisms of structural memory, as governed by the ratio of viscous to attractive forces, namely, the Mason number. Using recently developed fractal scaling laws, we show that the rheology is fully determined by the gel microstructure. Notably, these gels exhibit a double-fractal architecture, highlighting the remarkably broad range of length scales over which these disordered materials are structured. By clarifying how memory is encoded, our results offer strategies to tune shear sensitivity of colloidal gels and design smart materials.</p>

            <p>This paper explores the application of Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONNs) to solving Sudoku puzzles, presenting a biologically inspired approach based on phase synchronization. Each cell is represented by an oscillator whose phase encodes a digit, and the synchronization is governed by the Kuramoto model. The system dynamically evolves towards a valid solution by having the puzzle constraints encoded into the weight matrix of the network, and through a proposed novel phase mapping of the Sudoku digits. Experimental results show that ONNs achieve high performance for puzzles with moderate difficulty and outperform Hopfield Neural Networks, particularly in cases with up to 20 initially unknown values. Although the performance decreases with increased ambiguity, ONNs still produce correct solutions in some of the iterations, cases in which the baseline Hopfield Neural Network algorithm fails. The findings support ONNs as a viable alternative for solving constraint optimization problems and reinforce their relevance within emerging non-von Neumann computing paradigms.</p>

TDDFT predicts strong anisotropy in the DSF at the wavenumber examined here, even with $q$-blurring accounted for. The experimental spectrum has more than sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise levels to resolve these orientation dependencies, and therefore the orientational averaging of the polycrystalline sample is observed rigorously. Once the orientation averaging is accounted for, TDDFT is able to reproduce the experimental spectrum adequately. Finally, comparisons of predicted DSFs from jellium to experiment demonstrates the importance of accounting for lattice effects in modelling the spectrum from a polycrystal.</p>

            <p>Peierls theorem postulates that a one-dimensional (1D) metallic chain must undergo a metal-to-insulator transition via lattice distortion, resulting in bond length alternation (BLA) within the chain. The validity of this theorem has been repeatedly proven in practice, as evidenced by the absence of a metallic phase in low-dimensional atomic lattices and electronic crystals, including conjugated polymers, artificial 1D quantum nanowires, and anisotropic inorganic crystals. Overcoming this transition enables realizing long-sought organic quantum phases of matter, including 1D synthetic organic metals and even high-temperature organic superconductors. Herein, we demonstrate that the Peierls transition can be globally suppressed by employing lattice topology engineering of classic trans-polyacetylene chains connected to open-shell nanographene terminals. The appropriate topology connection enables an effective interplay between the zero-energy modes (ZMs) of terminal and the finite odd-membered polyacetylene (OPA) chains. This creates a critical topology-defined highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) that compensates for bond density variations, thereby suppressing BLA and reestablishing their quasi-1D metallic character. Moreover, it also causes the formation of an unconventional boundary-free resonance state, being delocalized over the entire chain with non-decaying spectral weight, distinguishing them from traditional solitons observed in polyacetylene. Our finding sets the stage for pioneering the suppression of material instability and the creation of synthetic organic quantum materials with unconventional quantum phases previously prohibited by the Peierls transition.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical axion fields coupled with one-dimensional spinless fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuto Hosogi, Koichiro Furutani, Yuki Kawaguchi</p>
            <p>We investigate coupled dynamics of spinless fermions on a one-dimensional lattice and spins on the links. When the hopping integral and the on-site potential of the fermions depend on the direction of the link spins, the low-energy effective theory predicts that the link spins behave as a dynamical axion field in 1+1 dimensions. The axion field $\theta$ is coupled to the electric field $E$ as $\theta E$, through which the link spins rotate in response to the applied electric field or the chemical potential gradient for charge-neutral fermions. This is the inverse phenomenon of Thouless pumping in the Rice-Mele model. After analyzing the dynamics by approximating the link spins with the classical ones and utilizing the axion Lagrangian, we show the full-quantum dynamics using the tensor network method. Even though we do not explicitly introduce the axion Lagrangian in solving the fermion-spin coupled many-body dynamics, the full-quantum results agree well with those with the classical spin approximation, including the dynamics of the axion field and fermion transport. In addition, we find that the quantum correlation between spins accelerates the dynamics of axion fields as the suppression of the expectation values of the link spins allows them to rotate easily. We also propose a possible experimental setup for cold-atomic systems to implement the Hamiltonian in this study.</p>

            <h2>Detecting entanglement with transport measurement in weakly interacting and fluctuating systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenhua Zhu, Gu Zhang, Dong E. Liu</p>
            <p>Measuring entanglement entropy in interacting, multipartite systems remains a significant experimental challenge. We address this challenge by developing a protocol to measure von Neumann entropy (VNE) and mutual information in quantum transport systems with both many-body interactions and multiple subsystems. Our analysis indicates that the vital connection between VNE and two-point correlation functions persists under these realistic conditions. The measurement is shown to be feasible for systems with boundary interactions and, critically, for bulk-interacting systems subject to a quantum quench of their internal couplings. Our work provides a pathway to experimentally quantify entanglement in complex interacting systems and establishes mutual information as an experimentally accessible indicator for system-environment entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in 2D TMD Field-Effect Transistors: A First-Principles Study via Sub-10 nm Channel Scaling Beyond the Boltzmann Tyranny</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Chang Chen, Ken-Ming Lin</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides present compelling prospects for next-generation low-power and high-frequency field-effect transistors. However, scaling 2D TMD FETs into the sub-10 nm regime remains challenging due to technical complexity. Moreover, short-channel effects in this length scale are not yet fully understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a classical-to-quantum crossover in electron transport during transistor downscaling, governed by two critical temperatures: Tc, which marks the crossover from thermionic emission to quantum tunneling, and Tt, beyond which thermionic emission dominates and the subthreshold swing approaches its classical limit. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the Boltzmann tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This quantum-tunneling-enhanced switching behavior demonstrates the potential of ultra-scaled 2D FETs to surpass classical efficiency constraints, offering a promising route toward energy-efficient, quantum-enabled computing technologies. This study presents a predictive, atomistic methodology for quantifying quantum transport and identifies the transition in electron transport mechanisms from semiclassical thermionic current in long-channel to quantum tunneling in short-channel 2D TMD FETs, offering critical design insights for leveraging quantum-classical hybrid transistor technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Troisi, Hannes Hübener, Angel Rubio, Simone Latini</p>
            <p>We propose an all-optical Moiré-like exciton confinement by means of spatially periodic optical cavities. Such periodic photonic structures can control the material properties by coupling the matter excitations to the confined photons and their quantum fluctuations. We develop a low energy non-perturbative quantum electro-dynamical description of strongly coupled excitons and photons at finite momentum transfer. We find that in the classical limit of a laser driven cavity the induced optical confinement directly emulates Moiré physics. In a dark cavity instead, the sole presence of quantum fluctuations of light generates a sizable renormalization of the excitonic bands and effective mass. We attribute these effects to long-range cavity-mediated exciton-exciton interactions which can only be captured in a non-perturbative treatment. With these findings we propose spatially structured cavities as a promising avenue for cavity material engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pawel Koczanowski, Paolo Nicolini, Hesam Khaksar, Enrico Gnecco</p>
            <p>We have investigated nanoscale wear on multilayered MoS2, the flagship transition metal dichalcogenide, by elastically driving sharp diamond tips under normal loads sufficient to induce in-plane fracture. The accompanying friction and the resulting wear structures were first characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), revealing a stick-slip regime that drives progressive exfoliation of MoS2 chips. At high normal forces, the slip phase displays hallmark signatures of avalanche dynamics, observed for the first time at the nanoscale, evidenced by a Generalized Extreme Value distribution of friction force drops. The AFM characterization is corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations, which reproduce experimental trends and uncover atomistic details of the wear process, including local amorphization, layer curving, and the involvement of distinct dissipative channels. Notably, it appears that only one-fifth of the energy inputted into the system is used to damage the MoS2 surface irreversibly. These results offer new insight into the physical mechanisms governing friction and wear in layered solids and provide a framework for precision cutting and nanomachining in van der Waals materials, relevant to next-generation devices at sub-micrometer scales.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermalization in a dimerized J1-J2 model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Smitarani Mishra, Shaon Sahoo</p>
            <p>We revisit the J1-J2 frustrated Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with dimerization ({\delta}) or modulation in the nearest-neighbor couplings to investigate its thermalization behavior. While the dimerization tends to induce localization, the next-nearest-neighbor interaction J2 generally favors thermalization, making the assessment of the model's compliance with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) particularly subtle. The challenge is further compounded by the model's SU(2) symmetry; the study of ETH compliance is necessarily done for each symmetry sector but separating different sectors of this symmetry is known to be a computationally demanding task. The current study is driven by two main motivations: first, to explore whether the well-known ground-state phases of the model have any bearing on its thermalization properties; and second, to understand how the interplay between two competing factors, namely, the non-uniformity (via {\delta}) and the beyond-nearest-neighbor interactions (via J2) governs the system's approach to thermal equilibrium. A systematic analysis shows that the ETH is most strongly satisfied for intermediate values of {\delta} (~ 0.5) with J2 ranging from intermediate (~ 0.5) to large (~ 1)- a parameter regime falls within the spiral ground-state phase. It is also found that when the system is in the gapless ground-state phase (which falls within the N'eel phase), the ETH is more prone to violation. In the regime of large {\delta} and small J2, the system is seen to enter a localized phase (characterized here by modulation in density-of-states; assessing ETH compliance is less meaningful for this phase.</p>

            <p>Responsive hydrogels can sense environmental stimuli and respond as actuators by expelling water and changing shape. In this article, we develop theory to demonstrate that groups of responsive hydrogels can also communicate with each other, by utilising the effect of elastic deformation on chemical reaction dynamics. Specifically, we consider a system of two spatially-separated chemically responsive hydrogels suspended in a solution in which a Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ)-type reaction occurs. Solving for the gel dynamics with the transport of solvent through the poroelastic network and the chemical kinetics, we show how the periodic swelling-deswelling oscillations of each gel can become coupled, and how this coupling can be exploited to send signals from one gel to the other via mechanical manipulation of the sender that affect the local (and thus global) frequency of oscillation.</p>

            <p>The generation and control of spin currents are crucial for advancing next-generation spintronic technologies. These technologies depend on materials capable of efficiently sourcing and interconverting spin and charge currents, while overcoming some limitations associated with conventional ferromagnets and heavy metals. Kagome topological antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetals, such as Mn$_3$Sn, present unique advantages owing to their distinct magnetic order and significant Berry curvature-driven transport phenomena. In this study, we systematically investigate spin current generation and spin-to-charge conversion phenomena in epitaxial (0001)-oriented Mn$_3$Sn thin films. Our findings reveal a spin Hall angle of 0.9$\%$ and a nearly isotropic in-plane spin Hall conductivity of 44.4~($\hbar$/e) $\Omega^{-1}$.cm$^{-1}$ at room temperature, originating from a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, as discussed in light of first-principle calculations. Furthermore, in Mn$_3$Sn(0001)/Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ heterostructures, we observe a high spin-mixing conductance of 28.52 nm$^{-2}$ and an interfacial spin-transparency of approximately 72$\%$. Notably, we also find that the spin diffusion length in Mn$_3$Sn(0001) epitaxial films exceeds 15 nm at room temperature. Our results highlight the potential of the topological Weyl noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn as an efficient material for spin transport and conversion in prospective spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>The removal of liquid droplets from solid surfaces is central to cleaning, coatings and oil recovery. Here we investigate liquid droplets capillary lifted by an immiscible working liquid. The rising working liquid triggers the formation of a capillary bridge between the solid and the air interface, which can lead to full, partial, or no droplet dewetting. Our theoretical model predicts, and experiments confirm, that the effectiveness of droplet removal can be tuned by manipulating the droplet contact angle with the solid and the interfacial tensions at play. Significantly, dewetting can be enhanced by employing working liquids with high interfacial tension, in contrast to common surface cleaning strategies where surfactants are used to reduce interfacial tension. Our findings can open new avenues for droplet manipulation with reduced resources and more sustainable environmental impact.</p>

            <h2>Three-magnon scattering of spin wave on edge-localized mode in thin ferromagnetic film</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Kharlan, Roman Verba, Krzysztof Sobucki, Paweł Gruszecki, Maciej Krawczyk</p>
            <p>Three-wave scattering is a fascinating phenomenon with many applications in various technologies. Reducing the system symmetry greatly affects three-wave scattering, which, in this case, goes beyond the simple momentum conservation law. In this study, we examine three-magnon scattering at the edge of a thin ferromagnetic film, when a bulk spin wave interacts with an edge-localized propagating spin-wave upon the reflection. This creates new bulk spin waves at mixed frequencies by means of three-magnon confluence or stimulated splitting processes. Using our developed analytical theory, which has been confirmed by full micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the wave generated in the stimulated splitting process is several times larger than that generated in the confluence process, primarily due to the lower group velocity. Furthermore, intensity of inelastically scattered waves exhibit a pronounced dependence on the incidence angle and frequency of the edge spin wave that goes beyond existing qualitative models. We show that the observed behaviors can only be explained by taking into account, that the scattered waves are created by several elementary three-magnon processes involving the incident and reflected waves. The complex nature of the scattered wave creation results in a strong sensitivity of its amplitude to the phase accumulation of spin waves upon reflection.</p>

            <p>Heterostructures of normal metals (N) and magnetic insulators (F) show paradigmatic effects, such as spin-Hall magnetoresistance and electric drag currents. These effects are linear in the applied electric field $E(\omega)$. Normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures also exhibit a characteristic nonlinear response quadratic in $E(\omega)$, referred to as unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance or spin-torque diode effect. In this article, we develop a theory of the bilinear response of FN bilayers and NFN trilayers for finite frequencies $\omega$ of the driving field and for four contributions that have been previously considered in the literature: Joule heating, phonon-mediated unidirectional magnetoresistance, the spin-torque diode effect, and magnonic unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance. We identify their distinct dependencies on frequency and the magnetization direction of the magnetic insulator and examine their scaling with magnetic field and system geometry, providing a framework for experimental differentiation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Imparato</p>
            <p>We investigate the thermalization of a stochastic system with discrete phase space, initially at equilibrium at temperature $T_i$ and then termalizing in an environment at temperature $T_f$ , considering both cases $T_i > T_f$ and $T_i < T_f$. For the simple case of a system with constant energy gaps, we show that the relation between the time scales of the cooling and heating processes is not univocal, and depends on the magnitude of the energy gap itself. Specifically the eigenvalues of the corresponding stochastic matrix set the time scales of the relaxation process and for large energy gaps the cooling process is found to exhibit the shortest relaxation times to equilibrium while the heating process is found to be faster at all scales for small gaps. We consider both the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Fisher information and its related quantities to quantify the degree of thermalization of the system. In the intermediate to long time regime both quantities are found to bear the same type of information concerning the rate of thermalization, and follow the ordering predicted by the dynamic eigenvalues. We then consider a more complex system with a more intricate stochastic matrix, namely a 1D Ising model, and confirm the findings on the existence of two regimes, one in which cooling becomes faster than heating. We make contact with a previous work where an harmonic oscillator was used as working fluid and the heating process was always found to be faster than the cooling one.</p>

            <p>Responsive drug delivery vectors can be designed using oppositely charged polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes. As a model, we created a brush-type copolymer (PECop), combining alginate and Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), whose side chains respond to temperature. Aggregation of PECop with the cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) was examined versus surfactant concentration and temperature. We used surface tension, electrophoretic mobility, zeta potential, potentiometry, light scattering, and atomic force microscopy to analyze the complexes. PECop/DTAB complexes form spherical, monodisperse aggregates in certain surfactant ranges, even though the copolymer itself is polydisperse. The binding isotherms combine features of oppositely charged polyelectrolyte/surfactant systems and hydrophobically modified polymers. Compared to alginate alone, PECop binds six times more DTAB at 1 mM surfactant concentration. Temperature responsiveness depends on surfactant concentration (cs). The surfactant triggers progressive collapse of polymer chains, maximized at cs = 2.8 mM, where thermo-responsiveness is lost. For cs 10 mM, size increases above LCST. This inversion in thermal response with rising surfactant concentration suggests changing aggregate structure, offering new avenues for drug delivery system design using these polymer-surfactant complexes.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent frontier in condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts exhibiting odd-parity spin splitting remain largely unexplored. Here, based on symmetry argument, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be induced from collinear antiferromagnets. Remarkably, using effective model analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices induces both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Manipulating matter with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables creation of atomically defined artificial structures that host designer quantum states. However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. To underpin of efficiency of our approach we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly scalability are discussed.</p>

            <p>A unique polymorph of binary tungsten trioxide, the epsilon phase of WO3, has non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric structure, typically stable below -43 degree C in bulk. We have stabilized the epsilon-WO3 at room temperature (RT) and nanostructured powders via flame spray pyrolysis synthesis. These nanopowders are drop cast into uniform thin films to enable RT measurement of ferroelectric and optoelectronic properties. We report ferroelectric hysteresis, nanoscale domains, and dipole switching measured via Piezo-response force microscopy (PFM). The epsilon-WO3 films also display optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and anticlockwise ferroelectric butterfly capacitance versus voltage hysteresis, further demonstrating the ferroelectric nature of epsilon-WO3. Remarkably, epsilon-WO3 shows ferroelectric polarization responses to optical stimuli and form bipolaron at RT, a spin-zero quasiparticle previously found only in cryogenic temperatures. The bipolaron formation and its interaction with electro-optical stimuli results in a single layer solid-state blue coloration, a ferrochromic effect. A mechanism of the ferrochromic effect is discussed. In summary, epsilon-WO3 appears to be a ferroelectric with the simplest structure, forming bosonic spin-zero bipolaron at RT, and it's dipoles respond to opto-electrical signals; therefore, this material holds significant promise for transforming the field of optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>Heterointerfaces of cubic boron nitride (cBN) with diamond have garnered significant interest due to their ultra-wide bandgaps and small lattice mismatch ($\sim1.5$\%), offering promising advancements in high-power and high-frequency electronic devices. However, the realization of this heterointerface has been limited by challenging growth conditions and insufficient understanding of interfacial properties. In this work, we employ density-functional theory to investigate the structural and electronic properties of diamond/cBN heterostructures as a function of interfacial stoichiometry, cBN thickness, and surface termination and passivation. Formation energies and interfacial bond lengths reveal that boron-terminated heterojunctions are the most stable while abrupt nitrogen-terminated heterojunctions are least stable, but can be stabilized by carbon-mixing. Bandstructures are computed for the heterostructures using hybrid functionals, where we find the abrupt boron-terminated and nitrogen-terminated heterojunctions exhibit $p$-type and $n$-type conductivity, respectively, while carbon-mixed heterojunctions retain wide insulating bandgaps ($4.2-4.4$ eV). The effective masses of the abrupt interfaces are found to vary strongly with stoichiometry. Intriguingly, charge analysis reveals two-dimensional electron or hole gas regions with ultra-high densities on the order of $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, with distinct spatial localization on either side of the interface. Band alignments show type-I and type-II band offsets tunable by interfacial composition. Further analysis of the band alignments reveals that the diamond valence bands consistently lie above the cBN valence bands by $0.25-2.1$ eV. Interestingly, the interface termination type switches the relative conduction band position of diamond relative to the cBN conduction band, exhibiting a type-I to type-II band alignment transition.</p>

            <p>A moisture-driven air capture (DAC) system was designed and demonstrated. A laboratory-scale system delivering ~1 g CO2 per day was demonstrated in a laminar flow hood and a small pilot-scale system that could deliver ~100 g CO2 daily was operated outdoors in a 4.2 m2 (areal surface area) raceway pond. Elongated mesh tube packets were designed to contain AER beads with high surface area for contacting the air and were found to reduce drying and CO2 loading time ~4-fold over larger mesh bags. Whereas this system was designed for CO2 delivery for cultivating photosynthetic microbes, its potential uses are much broader and include CO2 use in the food and beverage industry, conversion to fuels and chemicals, and sequestration. Techno-economic assessments for a practical scenario based on current results are \$670/tonne to capture CO2 into an alkaline solution and an additional \$280/tonne to extract CO2 from solution, purify and compress to 15 MPa for sequestration. An aspirational scenario modelling reasonable improvements to develop AER sorbents with a capacity of 4 mmol CO2 per gram of sorbent and water uptake of 50 wt.%, which leads to sorbent drying and loading within 1 h, shows a potential to reach \$51/tonne to capture CO2 into an alkaline solution and an additional \$109/tonne to get to 15 MPa for sequestration. Life cycle analysis shows the aspirational moisture-driven process uses up to 87% less energy than thermal and/or vacuum swing DAC by using energy from water evaporation; however, ~330 wt.% water uptake by the sorbent contained in a hydrophilic mesh packets leads to ~33-fold higher water use than the thermodynamic limits, which emphasizes future research is needed to increase sorbent hydrophobicity while maintaining and further increasing ion exchange capacity needed to bind CO2.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing the ergodicity of Worldvolume HMC via embedding Generalized-thimble HMC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masafumi Fukuma, Yusuke Namekawa</p>
            <p>The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an efficient and versatile algorithm that simultaneously mitigates both the sign problem and the ergodicity problem -- the latter being intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. We consider a situation in which the maximum flow time can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped Hubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of this parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original integration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature that facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time modest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes increasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential ergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the Generalized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC updates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from ergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the Boltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed region. Furthermore, its molecular dynamics step size can typically be taken to be larger than in WV-HMC. GT-HMC is thus better suited for sampling regions where ergodicity issues are not serious. We provide a proof that GT-HMC can be embedded within the WV-HMC algorithm, and verify that the two methods -- the pure WV-HMC and the combined version -- yield consistent results within statistical errors for the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model on a $6 \times 6$ spatial lattice at $T/\kappa = 1/6.4\simeq 0.156$ and $U/\kappa = 8.0$ with Trotter number $N_t = 20$ ($\kappa$: hopping parameter).</p>

            <p>We investigate a novel class of topological superconducting phases protected by exact fermion-parity symmetry and average crystalline symmetries. These phases belong to the broader class of average crystalline symmetry-protected topological (ACSPT) states and include numerous examples of intrinsic ACSPTs -- topological phases that arise only in the presence of disorder or decoherence. Unlike conventional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which require exact symmetry protection, average SPT (ASPT) phases remain robust as long as the symmetry is restored on average across disorder realizations or mixed-state ensembles. To classify these phases, we extend the real-space block state construction framework to account for average crystalline symmetries. In this generalized setting, lower-dimensional cells are decorated with ASPT phases, and the obstruction-free conditions are reformulated to incorporate the constraints imposed by average symmetry at block intersections. This provides a physically transparent and systematic method for classifying ASPTs with spatial symmetries that are only preserved statistically. We further validate our classification using a generalized spectral sequence analysis, which serves as an independent consistency check. Our results demonstrate that many crystalline topological superconductors remain well defined under realistic imperfections, and they uncover a rich landscape of intrinsically average-symmetry-protected phases that have no analog in clean systems.</p>

            <h2>Simulating high-temperature superconductivity in moiré WSe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiyu Xia, Zhongdong Han, Jiacheng Zhu, Yichi Zhang, Patrick Knüppel, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kin Fai Mak, Jie Shan</p>
            <p>The emergence of high transition temperature (Tc) superconductivity in strongly correlated materials remains a major unsolved problem in physics. High-Tc materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model--a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice--is believed to capture the essential physics of high-Tc materials, obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging. The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moiré WSe2, whose low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable, presents a new platform for tackling the high-Tc problem. Here, we tune moiré WSe2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moiré unit cell (v = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high-Tc phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at v = 1, superconducting domes upon electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states at elevated temperatures including strange metallicity. The highest Tc occurs adjacent to the Mott transition, reaching about 6% of the effective Fermi temperature. Our results establish a new material system based on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moiré superlattices that can be used to study high-Tc superconductivity in a highly controllable manner and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Deep Kernel Bayesian Optimisation for Closed-Loop Electrode Microstructure Design with User-Defined Properties based on GANs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Gayon-Lombardo, Ehecatl A. del Rio-Chanona, Catalina A. Pino-Munoz, Nigel P. Brandon</p>
            <p>The generation of multiphase porous electrode microstructures with optimum morphological and transport properties is essential in the design of improved electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries. Electrode characteristics directly influence battery performance by acting as the main sites where the electrochemical reactions coupled with transport processes occur. This work presents a generation-optimisation closed-loop algorithm for the design of microstructures with tailored properties. A deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is used as a deep kernel and employed to generate synthetic three-phase three-dimensional images of a porous lithium-ion battery cathode material. A Gaussian Process Regression uses the latent space of the generator and serves as a surrogate model to correlate the morphological and transport properties of the synthetic microstructures. This surrogate model is integrated into a deep kernel Bayesian optimisation framework, which optimises cathode properties as a function of the latent space of the generator. A set of objective functions were defined to perform the maximisation of morphological properties (e.g., volume fraction, specific surface area) and transport properties (relative diffusivity). We demonstrate the ability to perform simultaneous maximisation of correlated properties (specific surface area and relative diffusivity), as well as constrained optimisation of these properties. This is the maximisation of morphological or transport properties constrained by constant values of the volume fraction of the phase of interest. Visualising the optimised latent space reveals its correlation with morphological properties, enabling the fast generation of visually realistic microstructures with customised properties.</p>

            <h2>A Data-Driven Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Axial Load Capacity in Steel Storage Rack Columns</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bakhtiyar Mammadli, Casim Yazici, Muhammed Gürbüz, İrfan Kocaman, F. Javier Dominguez-Gutierrez, Fatih Mehmet Özkal</p>
            <p>In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns, was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive, Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure mode</p>

            <h2>Additive Manufacturing of PEEK/Lunar Regolith Composites for Sustainable Lunar Manufacturing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Azami, Pierre-Lucas Aubin-Fournier, Mehdi Hojjati, Krzysztof Skonieczny</p>
            <p>As humanity advances toward long-term lunar presence under NASA's Artemis program, the development of lunar-based manufacturing and construction (LBMC) capabilities has become increasingly critical. The high cost of transporting materials from Earth makes in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) essential, with lunar regolith serving as a promising local feedstock. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a compelling platform for LBMC due to its geometric flexibility, material efficiency, and capacity for on-demand, site-specific production. This study investigates material extrusion (MEX) AM of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) composites containing 10 to 50 wt% lunar regolith simulant (LRS). PEEK and LMS-1D powders were melt-compounded via twin-screw extrusion, printed using a high-temperature chamber, and annealed at 300 degrees C. The samples were characterized through density measurements, thermal analysis, tensile testing, and microstructural and elemental mapping. All filaments exhibited densities above 96%, though as-printed porosity increased from less than 1% in neat PEEK to 7.5% at 50 wt% LRS due to elevated melt viscosity. Regolith incorporation enhanced crystallinity (17.4 to 20.5%) and elastic modulus (by 6-41%), while reducing delamination and warping, which improved dimensional accuracy and print success rates. Tensile strength declined gradually from 107 MPa to 90 MPa up to 40 wt% LRS, then dropped sharply to approximately 70 MPa at 50 wt%. Annealing improved density and stiffness for composites containing up to 30 wt% LRS, with marginal benefit at higher contents. Microstructural and elemental analyses confirmed a continuous PEEK matrix with uniformly dispersed regolith particles. This work establishes processing windows and trade-offs for regolith-rich PEEK composites, supporting ISRU-enabled AM of future lunar infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Phase-fraction guided denoising diffusion model for augmenting multiphase steel microstructure segmentation via micrograph image-mask pair synthesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen, Minh Tien Tran, Hoheok Kim, Ho Won Lee</p>
            <p>The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks, particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.</p>

            <h2>Categorical Anomaly Matching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Antinucci, Christian Copetti, Yuhan Gai, Sakura Schafer-Nameki</p>
            <p>Matching 't Hooft anomalies is a powerful tool for constraining the low-energy dynamics of quantum systems and their allowed renormalization group (RG) flows. For non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, however, a key challenge has been the lack of a precise framework to characterize and quantify anomalies. We address this by identifying tensor functors between UV and IR symmetry categories as central to capturing these constraints. To this end, we introduce Anomalous Simple Categories (ASCies) as fundamental building blocks of categorical anomalies. A given symmetry category may support multiple ASCies, each encoding distinct anomalous features. These structures naturally arise in the context of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where tensor functors correspond to RG-interfaces between UV and IR SymTFTs, and ASCies are realized as particular such interfaces satisfying simple, universal criteria. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through examples involving anomalous 0-form, higher-form, and crucially, non-invertible symmetries in various spacetime dimensions.</p>

            <p>In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively, multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously, reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON) qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot (QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86\%. Extensions of this work may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin qubits.</p>

            <h2>Learning the action for long-time-step simulations of molecular dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Bigi, Michele Ceriotti</p>
            <p>The equations of classical mechanics can be used to model the time evolution of countless physical systems, from the astrophysical to the atomic scale. Accurate numerical integration requires small time steps, which limits the computational efficiency -- especially in cases such as molecular dynamics that span wildly different time scales. Using machine-learning (ML) algorithms to predict trajectories allows one to greatly extend the integration time step, at the cost of introducing artifacts such as lack of energy conservation and loss of equipartition between different degrees of freedom of a system. We propose learning data-driven structure-preserving (symplectic and time-reversible) maps to generate long-time-step classical dynamics, showing that this method is equivalent to learning the mechanical action of the system of interest. We show that an action-derived ML integrator eliminates the pathological behavior of non-structure-preserving ML predictors, and that the method can be applied iteratively, serving as a correction to computationally cheaper direct predictors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Massimo Solinas, Brandon Barton, Yuxuan Zhang, Jannes Nys, Juan Carrasquilla</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems exhibit a rich array of physical phenomena, including non-Hermitian skin effects and exceptional points, that remain largely inaccessible to existing numerical techniques. In this work, we investigate the application of variational Monte Carlo and neural network wavefunction representations to examine their ground-state (the eigenstate with the smallest real part energy) properties. Due to the breakdown of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle in non-Hermitian settings, we develop a self-consistent symmetric optimization framework based on variance minimization with a dynamically updated energy estimate. Our approach respects the biorthogonal structure of left and right eigenstates, and is further strengthened by exploiting system symmetries and pseudo-Hermiticity. Tested on a two-dimensional non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model endowed with a complex longitudinal field, our method achieves high accuracy across both parity-time symmetric and broken phases. Moreover, we propose novel optimization routines that address the challenges posed by exceptional points and provide reliable convergence to the ground state in regimes where standard variational techniques fail. Lastly, we show, through extensive numerical evidence, that our method offers a scalable and flexible computational tool to investigate non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems, beyond the reach of conventional numerical techniques such as the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm.</p>

            <p>Long-term stability of superconducting microwave resonators is essential for scalable quantum technologies; however, surface and interface degradation continue to limit device stability. Here, we demonstrate exceptional stability in microstrip resonators fabricated from epitaxial tantalum and aluminum films, protected by in situ deposited Al2O3 under ultra-high vacuum. These resonators initially exhibit internal quality factors (Qi) exceeding one million and maintain high performance with minimal degradation after up to fourteen months of air exposure. In contrast, devices relying on native surface oxides show substantial declines in Qi over time, indicating increased microwave losses. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the in situ Al2O3 effectively suppresses interfacial oxidation and preserves the chemical integrity of the underlying superconducting films, whereas native oxides permit progressive oxidation, leading to device degradation. These findings establish a robust, scalable passivation strategy that addresses a longstanding materials challenge in the development of superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Elastic electron scattering is one of the primary means of investigating materials on the atomic scale. It is usually described by modeling the sample as a fixed, static, perturbative potential, thereby completely neglecting the quantum nature of the atoms inside. In this work, we present a quantum treatment of elastic electron scattering. We show that the interaction of the probe beam and the sample results in entanglement between the two systems, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly on coherence and image contrast. As a timely example, we discuss decoherence in Bragg scattering on nanoparticles. We also investigate under which conditions the conventional scattering theory is recovered.</p>

            <p>In this thesis we build a phenomenological, strongly coupled quantum field theory in $2+1$-dimensions through AdS/CFT holography, by building a $3+1$-dimensional, negatively curved gravity theory with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, and a scalar field in the adjoint of $SU(2)$. We locate a phase transition between two distinct phases at zero and finite temperature, which are characterized through the dispersion relation of quasi-normal modes of probe fermions in the bulk, and correspond either to a Dirac semimetal or a band insulator. These phases are separated by a critical phase/critical point (depending if $T>0$ or $T=0$, respectively) where the band structure of boundary fermions exhibits semi-Dirac anisotropy. We characterize each phase at $T=0$ by explicit solutions to the bulk equations of motion in the infra-red, and determine that the critical point's spacetime is a Lifshitz geometry, whose dynamical critical exponent is approximately equal to $2$. We also find that this anisotropy induces a non-trivial scaling of the shear viscosity-entropy density ratio with respect to temperature in the $T\to 0$ limit, and find evidence that the anisotropic phase of the system corresponds to a finite-temperature quantum critical phase.</p>

To that end, protein structures are modeled as residue interaction networks (RINs), and the centrality detection task is cast as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Solved using D-Wave's simulated annealing, this approach is applied to a diverse set of proteins, including small peptides and biologically significant regulatory proteins. RinQ consistently finds residues that align with classical centrality benchmarks, underscoring the accuracy and reliability of the approach.

            <p>This monograph discusses dualities in physics: what dualities are, their main examples--from quantum mechanics and electrodynamics to statistical mechanics, quantum field theory and string theory--and the philosophical questions they raise. Part I first conceptualises dualities and discusses their main roles and themes, including how they are related to familiar notions like symmetry and interpretation. It also discusses the main simple examples of dualities: position-momentum, wave-particle, electric-magnetic, and Kramers-Wannier dualities. Part II discusses advanced examples and their inter-relations: particle-soliton dualities, electric-magnetic dualities in quantum field theories, dualities in string theory, and gauge-gravity duality. This Part ends with discussions of the hole argument, and how string theory counts the microstates of a black hole. Part III is an in-depth discussion of general philosophical issues on which dualities bear: theoretical equivalence (two theories 'saying the same thing, in different words'), scientific realism and the under-determination of theories by data, theory succession and the M-theory programme, explanation, and scientific understanding. It proposes a view of scientific theories that it dubs 'the geometric view of theories'. The book's treatment of the examples is at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level, starting from elementary and progressing to more advanced examples. The discussions of philosophical topics, such as referential semantics, theoretical equivalence, scientific realism and scientific understanding, are both self-contained and in-depth. Thus the book is aimed at students and researchers with an interest in the physical examples and philosophical questions about dualities, and also in how physics and philosophy can fruitfully interact with each other.</p>

Integrating Berry curvature over the momentum domain for the gapped spectra yields well-defined and quantized Chern numbers, enabling a systematic classification of them across interaction types. These topological invariants remain robust under deformation parameters like interaction and temperature, indicating that H-MFT encodes effective single-particle-state topology near a quantum critical point in strongly correlated systems.

            <p>We provide a mathematically rigorous Keldysh functional integral for fermionic quantum field theories. We show convergence of a discrete-time Grassmann Gaussian integral representation in the time-continuum limit under very general hypotheses. We also prove analyticity of the effective action and explicit bounds for the truncated (connected) expectation values of the non-equilibrium system. These bounds imply clustering with a summable decay in the thermodynamic limit, provided these properties hold at time zero, and provided that the determinant bound and decay constant of the fermionic Keldysh covariance are bounded uniformly in the volume. We then give bounds for these constants and show that uniformity in the volume indeed holds for a general class of systems. Finally we show that in the setting of dissipative quantum systems, these bounds are not necessarily restricted to short times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ho Truong Nam Hai, Jacqueline Hidalgo-Jiménez, Kaveh Edalati</p>
            <p>The formation of green energy carriers such as hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) via photocatalytic processes provides a clean method for addressing environmental and energy issues. To achieve highly efficient photocatalysts for H2 and CH4 generation, the present work introduces the P/N heterojunctions in a high-entropy oxide (HEO) with d0/d10 electronic junctions. The study uses CuO as a P-type semiconductor and the HEO containing d0 (Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta) and d10 (Zn) cations as an N-type semiconductor. The material exhibits improvements in optical properties, such as light absorption, charge mobility and reduced electron-hole recombination. The integration of two concepts, atomic-scale d0/d10 electronic junctions and micro-scale P/N heterojunctions, leads to enhanced H2 and CH4 production. Particularly after the partial removal of vacancies in the heterojunction, H2 production from photocatalytic water splitting reaches 0.71 mmol/g.h, and CH4 evolution from CO2 conversion reaches 2.40 umol/g.h with 72% selectivity for methanation. The integrated strategy of this study has a high potential in developing active heterostructured catalysts for clean fuel production.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique boundary phenomena absent in their Hermitian counterparts, most notably the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In this work, we explore a lattice model consisting of two coupled non-reciprocal chains, focusing on the interplay between system size, inter-chain coupling, and spectral topology. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we systematically examine the evolution of the complex energy spectra and spectral winding numbers under periodic and open boundary conditions. Our results uncover a variety of size-dependent localization transitions, including the emergence and instability of concurrent bipolar skin effects (CBSE) in the $W=0$ region, and their crossover to unipolar and conventional bipolar NHSE as the system size increases. Notably, we demonstrate that these size-dependent behaviors persist even beyond the weak-coupling regime, highlighting their universality in non-Hermitian systems with complex spectral structures. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms governing skin effects and offers practical guidelines for engineering non-Hermitian topological phases in synthetic lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shanyue Li, Mengying Hu, Jing Lin, Chen Fang, Zhensheng Tao, Kun Ding</p>
            <p>Solitons, typically resulting from a competition between band dispersion and nonlinearity, occur in lattices featuring the non-Hermitian skin effect as nonlinearity increases, accompanied by a transition in localization from linear skin modes to solitons. However, localization does not disentangle the role of skin modes in the soliton formation from that of band dispersion. Here, in such lattices, we uncover two distinct soliton phases, skin-mode-assisted solitons (SMASs) and nonreciprocity-dressed solitons (NRDSs). Rooted in fundamentally different mechanisms, SMASs originate from skin effect, while NRDSs stem from band nonreciprocity, each exhibiting unique spatial profiles. Using a stacked Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like model as a prototype, we delineate the phase diagram of SMASs and NRDSs, each having clear phase boundaries. To interpret them, we formulate a Wannier-function-based nonlinear Hamiltonian, showing that soliton formation depends critically on how skin-mode localization and band nonreciprocity suppress or enhance wave dispersion. For SMASs, skin-mode localization reduces wave broadening at the localization sites, thereby lowering the formation threshold. This soliton phase is observable from edge dynamics and accompanied by a dynamical stability reentrance when transitioning from linear skin modes. In contrast, NRDSs, as well as their thresholds, originate from bulk band nonreciprocity and persist under periodic boundary conditions. Our framework offers predictive tools for characterizing and engineering solitons in experimentally realizable non-Hermitian systems, spanning optics to mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Hollow Lattice Tensor Gauge Theories with Bosonic Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José M. Cruz, Masafumi Udagawa, Pedro Bicudo, Pedro Ribeiro, Paul A. McClarty</p>
            <p>Higher rank gauge theories are generalizations of electromagnetism where, in addition to overall charge conservation, there is also conservation of higher rank multipoles such as the total dipole moment. In this work we study a four dimensional lattice tensor gauge theory coupled to bosonic matter which has second rank tensor electric and magnetic fields and charge conservation on individual planes. Starting from the Hamiltonian, we derive the lattice action for the gauge fields coupled to $q=1,2$ charged scalars. We use the action formulation to carry out Monte Carlo simulations to map the phase diagram as a function of the gauge ($\beta$) and matter ($\kappa$) couplings. We compute the nature of correlators at strong and weak coupling in the pure gauge theory and compare the results to numerical simulations. Simulations show that the naive weak coupling regime (small $\kappa$, large $\beta$) does not survive in the thermodynamic limit. Instead, the strong coupling confined phase, spans the whole phase diagram. It is a proliferation of instantons that destroys the weak coupling phase and we show, via a duality transformation, that the expected strong confinement is present in the analog of Wilson line correlators. For finite matter coupling at $q=1$ we find a single thermodynamic phase albeit with a first order phase transition terminating in a critical this http URL $q=2$ it is known that the the X-cube model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractonic topological order is recovered deep in the Higgs regime. The simulations indeed reveal a distinct Higgs phase in this case.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Cluster State Spin Chain with Ising Fusion Category Symmetry: A Perspective from Weak Hopf SymTFT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhian Jia</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a construction of a cluster state lattice Hamiltonian that exhibits the symmetry of the Ising fusion algebra. This construction is formulated within the framework of weak Hopf symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), where we assign smooth and rough boundaries to the weak Hopf quantum double model, thereby extending the conventional cluster state model. Central to our construction is the weak Hopf Ising boundary tube algebra $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}$, whose representation category is equivalent to the Ising fusion category $\mathsf{Ising}$. We take this algebra as the input data for the weak Hopf quantum double model. The resulting model exhibits Ising fusion symmetry on both open and closed $1\text{d}$ manifolds. On open manifolds, the symmetry is governed by $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}} \otimes \mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee}$; on closed manifolds, it reduces to $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}) \otimes \operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$. Since the Ising fusion algebra embeds into $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$, the model faithfully realizes the symmetry of the Ising fusion category.</p>

            <h2>Gauge theory approach to describe ice crystals habit evolution in ice clouds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Di Natale, Francesco Pio De Cosmo, Leandro Cieri</p>
            <p>Ice clouds, particularly cirrus clouds, significantly influence Earth's radiative balance but remain poorly characterized in current climate models. A major uncertainty arises from the variability of their microphysical properties, especially the evolution of ice crystal habits under depositional growth. We propose a heuristic method to describe habit evolution based on four fundamental shapes identified in the literature and from in situ observations: droxtals, plates, columns, and rosettes. These represent the primary forms that are relevant under depositional growth, excluding aggregation. In this study, we employ a non-Abelian gauge theory within a field-theoretical framework, imposing an SU(2) $\otimes$ U(1) symmetry on the fields associated with each habit probability growth. This symmetry enables the derivation of a modified system of coupled Fokker-Planck equations, capturing the stochastic growth dynamics of ice crystals while incorporating phenomenological mutual influences among habits. This framework outlines a novel theoretical direction for integrating symmetry principles and field-theoretical tools into the modelling of habit dynamics in ice clouds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linus Andersson, Benjamin Olsson, Simone Gasparinetti, Robert Rehammar</p>
            <p>A stepped-impedance low-pass filter with integrated hollow waveguide absorbers is presented. The filter combines low insertion loss in the passband with strong attenuation at high frequencies, making it well suited for superconducting quantum computing applications, where qubits are sensitive to both near-band and far out-of-band radiation. The structure is implemented in a rectangular coaxial geometry, with inductive sections coupled to circular hollow waveguides oriented orthogonally to the transmission axis. Above their cutoff frequency, these waveguides efficiently couple to radiation inside the stepped-impedance filter, absorbing energy that would otherwise cause Cooper pair breaking in conventional superconductors. Optimal dimensions were obtained using a differential evolution algorithm applied to interpolated electromagnetic simulation data. A prototype was fabricated and characterized using a calibrated vector network analyzer up to 67 GHz. Measurements confirm a 3 dB cutoff frequency at 13.5 GHz, insertion loss below 0.45 dB for frequencies under 8 GHz, and more than 52.7 dB rejection above 17.3 GHz. The design offers a compact, low-loss solution for near-band filtering and suppression of quasiparticle-generating radiation in cryogenic quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Thermal effects in conformal field theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Miscioscia</p>
            <p>Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) are special classes of quantum field theories that find applications ranging from critical phenomena to theories of quantum gravity via holography. Understanding thermal effects in CFTs is crucial: criticality is experimentally probed at finite temperature, and, from the holographic perspective, the study of thermal CFTs is dual to the study of black holes in Anti-de Sitter space. In this thesis, we explore the kinematics and dynamics of finite-temperature CFTs by analyzing broken and unbroken symmetries and adapting various analytical and numerical bootstrap approaches to finite-temperature correlation functions. These methods are non-perturbatively valid and can be tested against exactly solvable models, such as free theories and two-dimensional systems, as well as compared with perturbative calculations. The main applications discussed in this thesis concern one- and two-point functions and the free energy density in the O(N) models in three dimensions, with particular focus on the 3d Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (N = 1,2,3).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Montag, Jordan Isaacs, Marcus Stålhammar, Flore K. Kunst</p>
            <p>Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies marking a simultaneous coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Despite the fact that multiband $n$-fold EPs (EP$n$s) generically emerge as special points on manifolds of EP$m$s, where $m<n$, EP$n$s as well as their topological properties have hitherto been studied as isolated objects. In this work we address this issue and carefully map out the emerging properties of multifold exceptional structures in three and four dimensions under the influence of one or multiple generalized similarities, revealing diverse combinations of EP$m$s in direct connection to EP$n$s. We find that simply counting the number of constraints defining the EP$n$s is not sufficient in the presence of similarities; the constraints can also be satisfied by the EP$m$-manifolds obeying certain spectral symmetries in the complex eigenvalue plane, reducing their dimension beyond what is expected from counting the number of constraints. Furthermore, the induced spectral symmetries not always allow for any EP$m$-manifold to emerge in $n$-band systems, making the plethora of exceptional structures deviate further from naive expectations. We illustrate our findings in simple periodic toy models. By relying on similarity relations instead of the less general symmetries, we simultaneously cover several physically relevant scenarios, ranging from optics and topolectrical circuits, to open quantum systems. This makes our predictions highly relevant and broadly applicable in modern research, as well as experimentally viable within various branches of physics.</p>

            <h2>Diverging conditional correlation lengths in the approach to high temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerome Lloyd, Dmitry A. Abanin, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>The Markov length was recently proposed as an information-theoretic diagnostic for quantum mixed-state phase transitions [Sang & Hsieh, Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 070403 (2025)]. Here, we show that the Markov length diverges even under classical stochastic dynamics, when a low-temperature ordered state is quenched into the high temperature phase. Conventional observables do not exhibit growing length scales upon quenching into the high-temperature phase; however, the Markov length grows exponentially in time. Consequently, the state of a system as it heats becomes increasingly non-Gibbsian, and the range of its putative "parent Hamiltonian" must diverge with the Markov length. From this information-theoretic point of view the late-time limit of thermalization is singular. We introduce a numerical technique for computing the Markov length based on matrix-product states, and explore its dynamics under general thermal quenches in the one-dimensional classical Ising model. For all cases, we provide simple information-theoretic arguments that explain our results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Di Carlo, Francesca Mignacco, Christopher W. Lynn, William Bialek</p>
            <p>Recent advances in experimental techniques enable the simultaneous recording of activity from thousands of neurons in the brain, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge: to build meaningful, scalable models of large neural populations. Correlations in the brain are typically weak but widespread, suggesting that a mean-field approach might be effective in describing real neural populations, and we explore a hierarchy of maximum entropy models guided by this idea. We begin with models that match only the mean and variance of the total population activity, and extend to models that match the experimentally observed mean and variance of activity along multiple projections of the neural state. Confronted by data from several different brain regions, these models are driven toward a first-order phase transition, characterized by the presence of two nearly degenerate minima in the energy landscape, and this leads to predictions in qualitative disagreement with other features of the data. To resolve this problem we introduce a novel class of models that constrain the full probability distribution of activity along selected projections. We develop the mean-field theory for this class of models and apply it to recordings from 1000+ neurons in the mouse hippocampus. This 'distributional mean--field' model provides an accurate and consistent description of the data, offering a scalable and principled approach to modeling complex neural population dynamics.</p>

            <p>The electronic structure, when restricted to the d-band approximation, is a computational model that is both efficient and useful for describing transition metals. In the absence of considering delocalized sp-states, this approximation gives rise to incorrect surface energies, binding energies, and an inaccurate description of ferromagnetic transition metals. The present work compares the complexity of implementing corrections with the possibility of using an accurate sp-d approach. Basic force fields based on the second moment approximation continue to be utilized for the description of interactions in transition metals. In contrast, the present study proposes an elementary and more accurate interatomic potential based on hopping parameters depending on distances. The charge distribution and the Stoner model are also analyzed to provide appropriate corrections to the tight-binding picture used to describe ferromagnetic metals and alloys.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantin V. Grigorishin</p>
            <p>By analogy with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of multi-band superconductors with inner (interband) Josephson couplings we formulate the three-band Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model with weak Josephson couplings between strongly asymmetrical condensates of scalar (Higgs) fields. Unlike usual single-band model, we found three Higgs bosons corresponding to three generations of particles, moreover the heaviest of them corresponds to the already discovered H-boson and decays into fermions of only the third generation through Yukawa interaction. The other two decay into fermions of the first and second generations accordingly, but they are difficult to observe due to very poor conditions for production. We found two sterile ultra-light Leggett bosons, the Bose condensates of which form the dark halos of galaxies and their clusters (i.e so called "dark matter"). The masses of the Leggett bosons are determined by the coefficient of the interband coupling and can be arbitrarily small ($\sim 10^{-20}\mathrm{eV}$) due to non-perturbativeness of the interband coupling. Since propagation of Leggett bosons is not accompanied by current, these bosons are not absorbed by gauge fields unlike the common-mode Goldstone bosons. Three coupled condensates of the scalar fields are related to the existence of three generations of leptons, where each generation interacts with the corresponding condensate getting mass. The interflavour mixing between the generations of active neutrinos and sterile right-handed neutrinos in the three-band system causes the existence of mass states of neutrino without interaction with the Higgs condensates.</p>

            <p>Conventional magnetic domain walls are characterized by reorientation of local spins. However, what occurs at the boundary of itinerant magnets is largely unknown. Here using spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigated the microscopic domain wall structure of the spin-density-wave (SDW) state in a prototypical itinerant antiferromagnet - chromium (Cr). At the boundary of two incommensurate SDW domains, we found the spins undergo finite-scale decay rather than reorientation. This generates a double-Q SDW state, which is further evidenced by an accompanying second-order charge modulation. In the commensurate SDW domains, a clear SDW energy gap is observed. Interestingly, the screw dislocations induced half vortex and anti-vortex of SDW, paired by antiphase domain wall. The spin density vanished at such antiphase domain walls. Remarkably, for the first time we observed the SDW quasiparticle states at the boundary, resembling the Andreev bound states in superconductors. These unique SDW boundary structures can be viewed as consequences of local interference of two SDWs, either with different Q or reversed phases. Our findings thus reveal a new type of domain wall distinct to that of local moment magnetism, with a mechanism rooted in the itinerant nature of SDW.</p>

            <p>We investigate supercurrent nonreciprocal effects in a superconducting weak-link hosting distinct types of vortices. We demonstrate how the winding number of the vortex, its spatial configuration, and the shape of the superconducting lead can steer the sign and amplitude of the supercurrent rectification. We find a general criterion for the vortex pattern to maximize the rectification amplitude of the supercurrent. The underlying strategy is the search for specific vortex core positions yielding a vanishing amplitude of the supercurrent first harmonic. We also prove that supercurrent nonreciprocal effects can be used to diagnose high-winding vortex and to distinguish between different types of vorticity. Our results thus provide a toolkit to control the supercurrent rectification by means of vortex phase textures and nonreciprocal signatures to detect vortex states with nonstandard phase patterns.</p>

            <p>Our current understanding of quantum chaos in many-body quantum systems hinges on the random matrix theory(RMT) behavior of eigenstates and their energy level statistics. Although RMT has been remarkably successful in describing `coarse' features of many-body quantum Hamiltonians in chaotic regimes, such as the Wigner-Dyson level spacing statistics or the volume-law behavior of eigenstate entanglement entropy, it remains a challenge to describe their `finer' features, particularly those arising from spatial locality. Here, we show that we can accurately describe the statistical behavior of eigenstate ensembles in many-body Hamiltonians by using pure random states with physical constraints that capture the essential features of the Hamiltonian, specifically spatial locality and symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on local spin Hamiltonians with a scalar U(1) charge. By constructing ensembles of constrained random states that account for two commuting scalar charges playing the role of energy and magnetization, we describe the patterns of entanglement of mid-spectrum eigenstates beyond their average volume-law behavior, including $O(1)$ corrections and fluctuations, analytically and numerically. When defining the correspondence between quantum chaotic eigenstates in many-body Hamiltonians and RMT ensembles, our work highlights the important role played by spatial locality in describing universal features beyond the volume-law behavior.</p>

            <p>Light scattering in random media is usually considered within the framework of the three-dimensional Anderson universality class, with modifications for the vector nature of electromagnetic waves. We propose that the linear dispersiveness of light introduces topological aspects into the picture. The dynamics of electromagnetic waves follow the same differential equations as those of a spin-$1$ Weyl semimetal. In the presence of disorder, this equivalence leads to a range of phenomena explored in this paper. These include topological protection against localization when helicity hybridization is weak, the emergence of exotic phases in weakly scattering media, and anomalies in optical transparency in the presence of synthetic `magnetic fields'. We argue that some of these effects should be visible and investigated already in weakly disordered optical materials.</p>

In these studies, traditional aging experiments (or ``quench'' aging protocols) are compared to aging curves constructed from finite-cooling-rate curves. By comparing the growth rates of spin glass order between the two types of aging curves, it is determined that quantitative comparisons between protocols which are taken by quenching and protocols using a finite cooling rate are not possible without a deeper understanding of the interplay between aging and rejuvenation. We then demonstrate that the data presented indicate that rejuvenation, rather than cumulative aging, is the cause for the discrepancies between the two growth rates.</p>

The difference is due to an intrinsic anomalous distribution (IAD). It originates from a nonlinear field effect during scattering, but its value is completely independent of scattering, because it represents the local equilibration of electron wave packets with field corrected energy. The proper definition of intrinsic current that is detectable in experiment must incorporate the effect of IAD. We also show that IAD is indispensable for consistency with fundamental physical relations. In addition, we predict that under ac driving, the intrinsic reponses in rectified and double-frequency channels exhibit distinct frequency dependence, for which we estimate the signals that can be probed in antiferromagnetic CuMnAs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ewan Scott, Michal Kwasigroch</p>
            <p>The local magnetic anisotropy of a typical crystalline compound is usually attributed to the combined effect of crystal electric fields and spin-orbit coupling. We show that this simple local picture is transformed in heavy-fermion compounds by the development of coherent electron scattering from local spin degrees of freedom. Provided the dominance of the coherence energy scale over the magnetic energy scale is strong enough, the fractionalisation and delocalisation of the spins destabilises their single-ion anisotropy by generating an opposing anisotropy in the exchange. Experimentally, this can manifest as competing splittings in the Curie-Weiss constants and effective moments. We show that in the presence of orthorhombic or tetragonal symmetry the destabilisation of the anisotropy can result in either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order that is perpendicular to the high-temperature easy axis. In the absence of destabilisation, we show that the order is more likely to be antiferromagnetic. In agreement with our theory, we also observe that the temperature at which the anisotropy of the uniform magnetic response changes tracks the coherence energy scale in a wide range of actinide and lanthanide compounds.</p>

The theory also accounts for the mechanism of metastable superconductivity with enhanced $T_c$, which emerges near the instability threshold.

Antiferroelectrics are promising for energy storage, solid-state cooling, and memory technologies; however, these materials are scarce, and their scalability remains largely unexplored.

We observe antiparallel sublattice polarization and stable double-hysteresis in single-crystalline (111)-oriented epitaxial La-doped hafnia films grown on yttrium-stabilized zirconia and show that the antipolar orthorhombic phase of hafnia adheres to the Kittel model of antiferroelectricity. Notably, compressive strain strengthens the antiferroelectric order in thinner La-doped hafnia films, achieving an unprecedented 850 C ordering temperature in the two-dimensional limit, highlighting hafnia's potential for advanced antiferroelectric devices.</p>

We focus on two specific cases where the phonon frequencies are $\omega_{0}=1$ and $\omega_{0}=2$, respectively. Phase transitions are analyzed using both the average and minimum inverse participation ratio to identify metallic, fractal, and insulating states. We provide numerical evidence to show that the presence of the optical cavity induces a critical, intermediate phase in between the extended and localized phases, hence drastically modifying the traditional transport phase diagram of the Aubry-Andre-Harper model, in which critical states can only exist at the well-defined metal-insulator critical point. We also investigate the probability distribution of the inverse participation ratio and conduct a multifractal analysis to characterize the nature of the critical phase, in which we show that extended, localized, and fractal eigenstates coexist. Altogether, our findings reveal the pivotal role that the coupling to electromagnetic cavities plays in tailoring critical transport phenomena at the microscopic level of the eigenstates.</p>

            <h2>Slow and fast topological dynamical phase transitions in a Duffing resonator driven by two detuned tones</h2>

            <p>The combination of a strong pump and a weak probe has been widely applied to investigate both optical and nanomechanical devices. Such pump-probe measurements allows for the exploration of nonlinear dynamics, driven by the large pump tone, by measuring the system response to a probe tone. In contrast, here we report on the dynamics of a mechanical Duffing resonator driven with a combination of two large tones at different frequencies. Our results indicate the presence of various distinct regimes with very different dynamics. We systematically investigate the impact of the relative strength and detuning between the two drives on the dynamical response. This provides an illustrative example of dynamical phase transitions in out-of-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>Solvent-induced ion clusters generate long-ranged double-layer forces at high ionic strengths</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Ribar, Clifford E. Woodward, Jan Forsman</p>
            <p>Recent experimental results by the Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) have identified a dramatic deviation from previously established theories of simple electrolytes. This deviation, referred to as anomalous underscreening, suggests that the range of electrostatic interactions increase upon a further addition of salt, beyond some threshold concentration (usually about 1M). In this theoretical work, we explore an extension of the Restricted Primitive Model (RPM) wherein a short-ranged pair potential of mean force (sPMF) is added to the usual Coulombic interactions so as to mimic changes of the hydration as two ions approach one another. The strength of this potential is adjusted so that the modified RPM saturates at a realistic concentration level (within a range 4-7M, typical to aqueous 1:1 salts). We utilise grand canonical simulations to establish surface forces predicted by the model and compare them directly with SFA data. We explore different sPMF models, which in all cases display significant clustering at concentrations above about 1M. In these models, we find significant double-layer repulsion at separations that significantly exceed those expected from standard RPM predictions. We do not, however, observe an increase of the screening length with salt concentration, but rather that this screening length seemingly saturates at a (rather high) value. The simulated long-ranged interactions are shown to correlate with ion cluster formation, implicating the important role of accompanying {\em cluster-cluster} interactions. In particular, steric interactions between clusters (manifested in density-density correlations) are quite relevant in these systems.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous and Topological Hall Effects with Phase-Space Berry Curvatures: Electric, Thermal, and Thermoelectric Transport in Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachariah Addison, Lauren Keyes, Mohit Randeria</p>
            <p>We develop a theory for the electrical and thermal transverse linear response functions such as the Hall, Nernst and thermal Hall effects in magnetic materials that harbor topological spin textures like skyrmions. In addition to the ordinary transverse response that arises from the Lorentz force due to the external magnetic field, there is an anomalous and a topological response. The intrinsic anomalous response derives from the momentum space Berry curvature arising from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a system with a nonzero magnetization, while the topological response arises from real space Berry curvature related to the the topological charge density of the spin texture. To take into account all these effects on an equal footing, we develop a semiclassical theory that incorporates all phase-space Berry curvatures. We show within a controlled, semiclassical approach that all conductivities -- electrical, thermoelectric, and thermal Hall -- can be written as the sum of three contributions: ordinary, anomalous and topological, when the conduction electron SOC is weaker than the exchange coupling to the spin texture. All other contributions, including those arising from mixed real-momentum space Berry curvature, are negligible in the regime where our calculations are controlled. We derive various general relations that remain valid at low temperatures including the Weidemann-Franz relation between the electrical and thermal conductivities and the Mott relation between the thermoelectric and electrical conductivities. We also discuss how an in-plane Hall response arises in three-dimensional materials with sufficiently low symmetry. Finally, the Hall response is qualitatively different when the conduction electron SOC is stronger than the exchange coupling to the spin texture, where we find that the anomalous term dominates and the topological term vanishes.</p>

            <p>The dynamical trajectory of a dissipative Rydberg many-body system could be flipped under a microwave field driving, displaying an enhanced sensitivity. This is because the intersection of the folded hysteresis trajectories exhibits a sharp peak near the phase transition, amplifying the response to small changes in the microwave field. Here, we demonstrate an experiment of enhanced metrology through flipping the hysteresis trajectory in a cold atomic system, displaying an approach to improve sensitivity near the gap-closing points. By measuring the intersection points of hysteresis trajectories versus Rabi frequency of the microwave field, we quantify the equivalent sensitivity to be 1.6(5) nV cm-1 Hz-1/2. The measurement is also dependent on the interaction time, optical depth and principal quantum number since the long-range interaction between Rydberg atoms could dramatically change the shape of hysteresis trajectories. The reported results suggest that flipping trajectory features in cold Rydberg many-body systems could advance sensing and metrology applications.</p>

            <h2>Universal Linear Response of First-Passage Kinetics: A Framework for Prediction and Inference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommer D. Keidar, Shlomi Reuveni</p>
            <p>First-passage processes are pervasive across numerous scientific fields, yet a general framework for understanding their response to external perturbations remains elusive. While the fluctuation-dissipation theorem offers a complete linear response theory for systems in steady-state, it fails to apply to transient first-passage processes. We address this challenge by focusing on rare - rather than weak - perturbations. Surprisingly, we discover that the linear response of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to such perturbations is universal. It depends solely on the first two moments of the unperturbed first-passage time and the mean completion time following perturbation activation, without any assumptions about the underlying system's dynamics. To demonstrate the utility of our findings, we analyze the MFPT response of drift-diffusion processes in two scenarios: (i) stochastic resetting with information feedback, and (ii) an abrupt transition from a linear to a logarithmic potential. In both cases, our approach bypasses the need for explicit determination of the perturbed dynamics, unraveling a highly non-trivial response landscape with minimal effort. Finally, we show how our framework enables a new type of experiment - inferring molecular-level fluctuations from bulk measurements, a feat previously believed to be impossible. Overall, the newly discovered universality reported herein offers a powerful tool for predicting the impact of perturbations on kinetic processes - and, remarkably, for extracting hidden single-molecule fluctuations from accessible bulk measurements.</p>

            <h2>More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): Rényi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of the Rényi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the Rényi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the Rényi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n>1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.</p>

            <p>We study the effects of the two-spinon excitations on the field-field correlator of the Tonks-Girardeau gas. While these excitations have been previously examined in the ground state of the system, their role at finite temperatures remains unexplored. Here, we extend the analysis to the one-dimensional interacting Bose gas at thermal equilibrium, focusing on the one-body correlation function of the infinitely repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. We demonstrate that two-spinon excitations, characterized by two holes within the rapidity distribution, constitute the dominant contribution to the field-field correlator at low temperatures. Furthermore, we analytically show that incorporating additional particle-hole excitations diminishes their contribution, highlighting the efficacy of the two-spinon framework in capturing the essential physics of the system. Numerical evaluations of both the Fredholm determinant and the spectral sum stemming from the two-spinon program, with the addition of particle-hole excitations, reveal convergence at low temperatures.</p>

We propose that the relatively small spin-orbit coupling and the small extra crystal field splitting in these materials create anisotropic exchange interactions and strong single-ion anisotropy, respectively, whose interplay becomes the source of quadrupolar moments selectively appearing on certain sublattices, leading to a spatially modulated hybrid of dipolar and quadrupolar moments.

            <h2>Berry Phase Dynamics of Sliding Electron Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongxin Zeng, Andrew J. Millis</p>
            <p>Systems such as Wigner crystals and incommensurate charge density waves that spontaneously break a continuous translation symmetry have unusual transport properties arising from their ability to slide coherently in space. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that spontaneous translation symmetry breaking in some two-dimensional materials with nontrivial quantum geometry (e.g., rhombohedral pentalayer graphene) leads to a topologically nontrivial electron crystal state called the anomalous Hall crystal and characterized by a vanishing linear-response dc longitudinal conductivity and a non-vanishing Hall conductivity. In this work we present a theoretical investigation of the sliding dynamics of this new type of electron crystal, taking into account the system's nontrivial quantum geometry. We find that when accelerated by an external electric field, the crystal acquires a transverse anomalous velocity that stems from not only the Berry curvature of the parent band but also the Galilean non-invariance of the crystal state (i.e., crystal states with different momenta are not related by simple momentum boosts). We further show that acceleration of the crystal modifies its internal current from the static crystal value that is determined by the Chern number of the crystal state. The net Hall conductance including contributions from center-of-mass motion and internal current is in general not quantized. As an experimentally relevant example, we present numerical results in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and discuss possible experimental implications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen-Xin Jiang, Zi-Xiang Hu, Bo Yang</p>
            <p>Flat bands result in a divergent density of states and high sensitivity to interactions in physical systems. While such bands are well known in systems under magnetic fields, their realization and behavior in zero-field settings remain largely unexplored. Here we compare the behavior of electrons confined to a single flat band on the surface of a sphere to those in flat bands under a magnetic field. The zero-field flat band exhibits an additional C(2) symmetry, which causes electrons to symmetrically cluster on opposite sides of the sphere's center when a trapping potential is introduced, resulting in a unique form of long-range "entanglement". To explore these findings experimentally, we propose a feasible setup to explore the unique properties of zero-field flat bands on spherical substrates, offering a promising route for studying interaction-driven states in spherical geometry without external fields.</p>

            <p>We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L>\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Liu, Zehan Chen, Qiming Shao</p>
            <p>Realizing novel topological states in magnonic systems unlocks robust, low-power spin-wave devices. In this letter, we show that incorporating left-handed spin waves (antimagnons) fundamentally reorganizes band topology, and enables tunable spin-wave coupling and chirality. We proposed a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger like model, the 2D-SSH4 chain, where dipolar interactions between magnons and antimagnons generate topological bands with nonzero Chern numbers. This framework explains the origin of topological surface states in ferromagnetic multilayer and shows they share the same topological origin as classic magnetostatic surface spin waves. Our model also offers a straightforward framework for designing more complex magnetic multilayer connected by dipolar interactions, such as antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic multilayer. In these dipolar-coupled multilayers, both coherent and dissipative interlayer spin-wave couplings together with the layer resolved chirality, are tunable via external magnetic fields and spin torques. Our results provide a practical platform for topological magnonics, enabling control of magnon chirality and coupling in future devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerome Garnier-Brun, Ruben Zakine, Michael Benzaquen</p>
            <p>We study the hydrodynamics of a system of agents who optimize either their individual utility (self-interest) or the collective welfare (cooperation). When agents act selfishly, their interactions are non-reciprocal, driving the system out of equilibrium; by contrast, purely altruistic dynamics restore reciprocity and yield an equilibrium-like description. We investigate how mixtures of these two behaviors shape the macroscopic properties of the liquid of agents. For highly rational agents, we find that introducing a small fraction of altruists can suppress the sub-optimal clustering induced by selfish dynamics. This phenomenon can be attributed to altruists localizing at interfaces and acting as effective surfactants, shedding a new light on earlier findings in fixed neighborhood-based models [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{120}, 208301 (2018)]. When agents are boundedly rational, we introduce a well-mixed approximation that reduces the two-population model to a single effective scalar field theory. This allows us to leverage state-of-the-art tools from active matter to analytically characterize how altruism modifies surface tension and nucleation dynamics.</p>

At the same time, higher-frequency modes >60GHz exhibit a surprisingly fast damping, following a scaling law incompatible with the expected attenuation mediated by phonon-phonon scattering.

            <p>Topologically ordered phases exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: Their anyonic excitations may exhibit different transformation patterns under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological orders. We develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune phase transitions between different symmetry fractionalization patterns. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are immobile on their own. By deforming the local tensors of the fixed point ground state, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions are non-stabilizer states and have non-vanishing correlation lengths. They even exhibit power-law correlations at criticality between two symmetry-enriched topological orders. Furthermore, the isoTNS description allows for the explicit construction of a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these exotic 3D states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme using only a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays alongside measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order and to study 3D quantum phase transition with exact wavefunctions, and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order on quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Titus Quah, Sho C. Takatori, James B. Rawlings</p>
            <p>Active matter swarms -- collectives of self-propelled particles that could self-assemble, ferry microscopic cargo, or endow materials with dynamic properties -- remain hard to steer. In crowded systems, tracking or controlling individual agents becomes challenging, so strategies should operate on macroscopic fields like particle density. Yet predicting how density evolves is difficult due to inter-agent interactions. For model-based feedback control methods -- like Model Predictive Control (MPC) -- fast, accurate, and differentiable models are crucial. Detailed agent-based simulations are too slow, necessitating coarse-grained continuum models. However, constructing accurate closures -- approximations expressing the effect of unresolved microscopic states (e.g., agent positions) on continuum dynamics -- is challenging for active matter swarms. We present a learning-for-control framework that learns continuum closures from agent simulations, demonstrated with active Brownian particles under a controllable external field. Our Universal Differential Equation (UDE) framework represents the continuum as an advection-diffusion equation. A neural operator learns the advection term, providing closure relations for microscopic effects like self-propulsion, interactions, and external field responses. This UDE approach, embedding universal function approximators in differential equations, ensures adherence to physical laws (e.g., conservation) while learning complex dynamics directly from data. We embed this learned continuum model into MPC for precise agent simulation control. We demonstrate this framework's capabilities by dynamically exchanging particle densities between two groups, and simultaneously controlling particle density and mean flux to follow a prescribed sinusoidal profile. These results highlight the framework's potential to control complex active matter dynamics.</p>

            <p>The semiclassical Boltzmann equation is widely used to study transport effects. However, being semiclassical and borrowing heavily from classical mechanics, the formalism calls for verification from the perspective of quantum mechanics. Although previous works discussed the relation between the quantum density matrix and the semiclassical formalism, direct comparison, especially of disorder effects, including side jumps and skew scattering in the two approaches, has not been fully conducted. In this work, we systematically and directly compare the semiclassical Boltzmann equation and its counterpart arising from the density matrix. We find that there is an additional correction to the side-jump velocity, the longitudinal velocity, which is longitudinal in the leading order, and its resultant current does not require time-reversal symmetry breaking. Moreover, we find the semiclassical side-jump collision integral is an approximation of the quantum result at moderate temperatures, and it also contains a correction induced by the longitudinal velocity. We also show that the scattering rate obtained from the density matrix agrees with the semiclassical results. Our work illuminates the quantum roots of the semiclassical Boltzmann equation.</p>

            <p>In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets has been reported and here we refer to them as unconventional magnets because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$- and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.</p>

            <p>In this study, we present an experimental work on bubble nucleation and growth using a model system comprised of viscoelastic polyvinyl butyral confined in a Hele-Shaw cell geometry that is decompressed at elevated temperatures. The appearance and growth of bubbles are connected to the temperature-induced shift in chemical equilibrium experienced simultaneously by two gases present in the bulk. The latter becomes simultaneously oversaturated with water vapor and slightly undersaturated in air. Our bubbles grow with various shapes and sizes depending on the initial morphology of the nucleus or the presence of neighboring bubbles. For large nuclei, bubbles grow anisotropically because of contact line pinning. The likelihood of nucleation is related to the amount of water dissolved in the bulk and the imposed temperature. Counter-intuitively, the number of nuclei whence a bubble can grow is inversely correlated with said temperature. In an analogy with champagne, we show that nucleation can either be natural, at trapped fibers or dust particles, or artificial, at crenels we purposefully made in the glass surface. Our results indicate that the growth rate of bubbles can be impacted by the nucleation mechanism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jongbae Hong</p>
            <p>We investigate a quantum phase transition (QPT) in quantum point contacts by analyzing the gate-voltage-dependent quasiparticle energy at the Fermi level at zero temperature. This energy is computed using the local density of states at the site of the localized spin, which is extracted from the replicated gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance shaped by entangled-state tunneling. The QPT occurs between symmetric ($G \geq 0.7 G_0$) and asymmetric ($G < 0.7 G_0$) Kondo coupling states, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, and is driven by the migration of a localized spin in response to the side-gate voltage. The asymmetric state exhibits two distinct Kondo temperatures, while the symmetric state has only one. The existence of two Kondo temperatures in the $G < 0.7 G_0$ regime accounts for both the anomalous gate-voltage dependence of the zero-bias anomaly width and the inability to define a Kondo temperature in the $G < 0.7 G_0$ region.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic 'half-Rashba' spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Angular Dependence of Specific Heat and Magnetization Effects in the Kitaev Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takao Morinari, Hibiki Takegami</p>
            <p>We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the Kitaev model using the equation of motion approach for the spin Green's function, considering both the case of suppressed magnetization ($m = 0$) and finite magnetization ($m \neq 0$). When magnetization is suppressed, the specific heat exhibits a clear $60^\circ$ periodicity in its angular dependence, with the locations of maxima and minima consistent with recent experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. A qualitative difference in their temperature dependence is observed: the minima show gap-like behavior that may signal Majorana gap formation due to time-reversal symmetry breaking, while the maxima do not exhibit the expected gapless Majorana fermion signature. In addition, a linear-in-field effect -- distinct from magnetization -- emerges, with the characteristic temperature below which angular dependence appears increasing linearly with the magnetic field. Importantly, this directional dependence becomes quantitatively significant only at very low temperatures. When finite magnetization is included, the angular dependence of the specific heat remains, and the qualitative behavior is similar to the $m = 0$ case: the minima continue to exhibit gap-like features, while the maxima do not show signatures of gapless Majorana fermions. These results suggest that suppressing magnetization alone is insufficient to realize quantum spin liquid behavior in the Kitaev model under a magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Towards Identifying the PL6 Center in SiC: From First-Principles Screening to Hyperfine Validation of Competing Defect Candidates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Zhao, Mingzhe Liu, Yu Chen, Qi Zhang, Chang-Kui Duan</p>
            <p>The PL6 color center in 4H-SiC, known for its excellent ambient-temperature spin and optical properties, has an unresolved microscopic origin. In this first-principles study, we systematically investigate potential structures to clarify its nature. We first rigorously examine the DV-antisite hypothesis (a divacancy paired with a carbon antisite, $\mathrm{C_{Si}}$), analyzing the energetic, electronic, and spin properties of various $V_\mathrm{Si}V_\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{C_{Si}}$ configurations. Two $\mathrm{C_{3v}}$-symmetric $\mathrm{kk+C_{Si}}$ complexes emerge as strong candidates within this framework. Subsequently, a critical comparison of hyperfine interaction signatures is performed between these candidates, the alternative OV model [specifically OV(hh) and OV(kk), an oxygen replacing C together with a Si vacancy], and experimental data. This analysis demonstrates that the OV(hh) structure more accurately reproduces PL6's hyperfine features. Furthermore, re-evaluation of the proposed OV(hk) model for the related PL5 center reveals zero-field splitting parameter $E$ inconsistencies with experimental results, suggesting that PL5 and PL6 may have distinct origins. These findings provide crucial theoretical insights and motivate targeted experimental validation for these quantum defects.</p>

            <h2>Using Thermodynamics and Microstructure to Mitigate Overfitting in Pellet Reduction Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ömer K. Büyükuslu, Fabrice Yang, Dierk Raabe, Moritz to Baben, Anna L. Ravensburg</p>
            <p>Direct reduction of iron using hydrogen-rich gas is rapidly emerging as a key strategy for green steel production. This process involves complex, multiscale phenomena, encompassing solid-state phase transformations and gas transport through pores, that must be accurately represented for predictive industrial implementation. Here, we present a thermodynamically sound pellet-scale model that describes these mechanisms and can serve as a foundation for improving the understanding of pellet reduction kinetics in H$_2$/CO-containing atmospheres. The model assumes that the gas phase remains in thermodynamic equilibrium, meaning that the composition of the gas instantaneously adjusts to any changes in the system. This reduces the number of fitting parameters drastically compared to other existing models, while maintaining a strict thermodynamic upper bound estimate. A driving force term is included in the reaction rate equation based on the partial pressure of O$_2$ in the equilibrated gas phase. This constrained equilibrium-based approach ensures that the three iron oxide reduction steps and the formation of graphite and cementite in carbon-containing gases occur only if they are thermodynamically possible. It is demonstrated that fitting kinetic parameters based on conversion degree data alone leads to overfitting. This is true both for existing models and the model introduced here, despite the fact that the latter contains fewer parameters. To overcome this overfitting problem, spatially resolved microstructural data at key reduction stages can be considered, as shown here for recently reported data for a pellet reduced in H$_2$ atmosphere.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Tononi, G. E. Astrakharchik</p>
            <p>We investigate the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation in ideal bosonic gases confined to axially-symmetric surfaces of revolution. The single-particle Schrödinger equation is formulated on a general surface and then explicitly solved in the ellipsoidal and toroidal geometries to determine the one-body energy spectrum. We discuss how the curved geometry impacts the quantum statistical properties of ideal Bose gases confined on these surfaces. Specifically, we observe that Bose-Einstein condensation is suppressed when the surface aspect ratio is increased and, correspondingly, it becomes highly elongated and acquires a one-dimensional character. We also evaluate the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum, providing insights into the collective excitations of the condensate. Our results establish the conditions to achieve quantum degeneracy in curved manifolds, thus guiding forthcoming experiments with thin shells, and set the basis for solving the few-to-many body problem in general surfaces of revolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Puspita Parui, Bheema Lingam Chittari</p>
            <p>We study the topological properties of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling induced pseudospin-$1$ system Dice lattice under the influence of a staggered electric potential and magnetization. The band structure and topological phases of the system are investigated and compared with the pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system honeycomb lattice. Under individual influence of the staggered electric field and magnetization, the system undergoes a distinct phase transition: (i) a staggered electric potential drives the system from a quantum anomalous Hall $(C_n = 2)$ to a valley polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase $(C_n = -1)$ associated with edge modes with a flip in the chirality; while (ii) a staggered magnetization changes the system to a topological metal associated with unconventional antichiral edge bands, from a topological insulator. These results are further supported by calculations of the Chern phase diagrams, Hall conductance, zigzag, and armchair edge states. Our findings enhance the understanding of new topological phases in the 2D pseudospin-$1$ system and open up a new platform to explore the anti-chiral edge states.</p>

            <h2>Plasmons in N-layer systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taehun Kim, E. H. Hwang, Hongki Min</p>
            <p>In multilayer structures, the coupling between layers gives rise to unique plasmon modes, but analytic solutions are typically available only for bilayers due to the increasing complexity as the number of layers increases. We investigate plasmons in multilayer structures, including the effects of interlayer tunneling. By introducing the Coulomb eigenvector basis for multilayer systems, which can be solved exactly using Kac-Murdock-Szegő Toeplitz matrices, we analytically derive the long-wavelength plasmon dispersions both with and without interlayer tunneling. In the $N$-layer systems, we find that, in the absence of interlayer tunneling, the out-of-phase acoustic or charge neutral plasmon modes with linear dispersions ($\omega_\alpha\propto q/\sqrt{{1-\cos{\left(\frac{\alpha-1}{N}\pi\right)}}}$ for $\alpha = 2, 3, \cdots, N$) exist, while the in-phase classical plasmon mode exhibits its conventional dispersion ($\omega_1\propto \sqrt{q}$). When interlayer tunneling is present, the out-of-phase modes develop plasmon gaps that are governed by specific interband transitions, whereas the classical mode remains unaffected. These findings have broad applicability to general coupled-layer structures.</p>

            <p>We analyze two simple model planar molecules: an ionic molecule with D3 symmetry and a covalent molecule with D6 symmetry. Both symmetries allow the existence of chiral molecular orbitals and normal modes that are coupled to each other in a Jahn-Teller manner, invariant under U (1) symmetry with generator a pseudo angular momentum. In the ionic molecule, the chiral mode possesses an electric dipole but lacks physical angular momentum, whereas, in the covalent molecule, the situation is reversed. In spite of that, we show that in both cases the chiral modes can be excited by a circularly polarized light and are subsequently able to induce rotational motion of the entire molecule.</p>

            <p>We study the stability of spin dynamics for a spin-orbit (SO) coupled boson held in a driven non-Hermitian double-well potential. Under high-frequency approximation, we analytically derive the Floquet states and complex Floquet quasienergies of the system and reveal a striking parity-dependent stability criterion: when the ratio of the Zeeman field strength to the driving frequency $\Omega/\omega$ is even, stable spin dynamics can be achieved for \emph{arbitrary} SO coupling strength. However, when $\Omega/\omega$ is odd, stability requires the SO coupling strength to be integer or half-integer values. Particularly, we find four types of stability boundary lines for non-zero bias field strength, in sharp contrast to the commonly observed stability regions. These results establish a tunable parity-governed mechanism for stabilizing spin dynamics in non-Hermitian cold atomic systems.</p>

            <p>We construct Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFTs) for continuous subsystem symmetries, which are inherently non-Lorentz-invariant. Our framework produces dual bulk descriptions -- gapped foliated and exotic SymTFTs -- that generate gapless boundary theories with spontaneous subsystem symmetry breaking via interval compactification. In analogy with the sandwich construction of SymTFT, we call this Mille-feuille. This is done by specifying gapped and symmetry-breaking boundary conditions. In this way we obtain the foliated dual realizations of various models, including the XY plaquette, XYZ cube, and $\phi$, $\hat{\phi}$ theories. This also captures self-duality symmetries as condensation defects and provides a systematic method for generating free theories that non-linearly realize subsystem symmetries.</p>

            <p>Magnons represent quantised collective motions of long-range ordered spins. For wavelength below 100 nm, exchange interactions dominate their physics, which gives rise to a so far unexplored regime of nonlinearities and couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Besides their selective excitation, also the detection of such short-wavelength spin waves remains a challenge of current research and technology. Here, we probe the intensity and wave vector of magnons by means of quasi-elastic, resonant soft-X-ray scattering. This Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) can access magnons directly in momentum space with remarkable sensitivity and high photon efficiency up to THz frequencies and down to few-nanometre wavelengths. The two-dimensional information obtained by this light-scattering-based technique is especially valuable for studying the nonlinear interactions of exchange-dominated magnons within technologically relevant thin-film samples. In doing so, we uncover a rich variety of deeply nonlinear magnon interactions, highlighting their potential for applications in novel computing schemes. With its intrinsic element-selectivity and ability to probe also buried layers, soft-X-ray MMM has the potential to establish itself as an advanced tool for ultrabroadband studies of short-wavelength magnonics.</p>

            <h2>Expansion of one-dimensional spinor gases from power-law traps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ovidiu I. Patu, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo</p>
            <p>Free expansion following the removal of axial confinement represents a fundamental nonequilibrium scenario in the study of many-body ultracold gases. Using the stationary phase approximation, we analytically demonstrate that for all one-dimensional spinor gases with repulsive contact interactions, whether bosonic or fermionic, the asymptotic density and momentum distribution can be directly determined from the quasimomentum distribution (Bethe rapidities) of the trapped gas. We efficiently obtain the quasimomentum distribution numerically by solving the integral equations that characterize the ground state of the integrable system within the local density approximation. Additionally, we derive analytical solutions for both weakly and strongly interacting regimes. Unlike in bosonic gases, where rapidity distributions and density profiles vary significantly across interaction regimes, fermionic gases maintain similar profiles in both weakly and strongly interacting limits. Notably, the gas expands self-similarly only when released from a harmonic trap. For other power-law trapping potentials, the asymptotic density profile is strongly influenced by the initial confinement geometry. Our results extend readily to Bose-Fermi mixtures and finite temperatures.</p>

            <p>Graphene multilayers exhibit electronic spectra that depend sensitively on both the number of layers and their stacking order. Beyond trilayer graphene, mixed stacking sequences (alternating Bernal and rhombohedral layers) give rise to multiple coexisting low-energy bands. Here we investigate ABCBC-stacked pentalayer graphene, a less-studied non-centrosymmetric mixed sequence. This stacking can be regarded as an ABC (rhombohedral) trilayer on top of an AB (Bernal) bilayer, so its low-energy band structure contains both a cubic band and a parabolic band that hybridize. In transport measurements, we observe an intrinsic band gap at charge neutrality whose magnitude changes asymmetrically under an applied perpendicular displacement field. This behavior reflects the spontaneous layer polarization inherent to the broken inversion symmetry and mirror symmetry. By tuning the displacement field and carrier density, we drive multiple Lifshitz transitions in the Fermi surface topology and realize Landau levels with different degeneracies arising from the multi-flatband system. Remarkably, a v = -6 quantum Hall state emerges at an exceptionally low magnetic field (~20 mT), indicating the interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking and Berry curvatures. Our results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a tunable platform with various broken symmetries and multiple flatbands, suitable for exploring emergent correlated electronic states.</p>

            <p>We study the violation of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in hybrid superconducting/normal metal leads coupled to a central region containing localized levels. We find violations of the TUR, also in its formulation recently derived for coherent conductors [Phys. Rev.

To support our conclusion, we introduce a dephasing probe, demonstrating that the violation is directly correlated with the superconducting coherence, as measured by the pair amplitude in the central region. When the central region is a Cooper-pair splitter, crossed Andreev processes introduce nonlocal superconducting correlations that further enhance the violation. Finally, we derived a new inequality, fulfilled in hybrid superconducting - normal metal systems, in the limit in which quasi-particle tunneling can be ignored.</p>

            <p>Accurate and reliable algorithms to solve complex impurity problems are instrumental to a routine use of quantum embedding methods for material discovery. In this context, we employ an efficient selected configuration interaction impurity solver to investigate the role of bath discretization, specifically, bath size and parameterization, in Hamiltonian-based cluster dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT) for the one- and two-orbital Hubbard models. We consider two- and four-site clusters for the single-orbital model and a two-site cluster for the two-orbital model. Our results demonstrate that, for small bath sizes, the choice of parameterization can significantly influence the solution, highlighting the importance of systematic convergence checks. Comparing different bath parameterizations not only reveals the robustness of a given solution but can also provide insights into the nature of different solutions and potential instabilities of the paramagnetic state. We present an extensive analysis of the zero-temperature Mott transition of the paramagnetic half-filled single-band Hubbard model, benchmarking our findings against previous literature. We find that for the single-band model the dependence on parameterization is weak for the largest bath sizes accessible with ASCI, while a tendency towards a nematic solution can be seen when the bath size is small. Building on this, we extend our study to the multi-band regime, where we present the first systematic analysis at zero temperature for two orbitals and a two-site cluster. This setup allows us to assess the effect of nearest-neighbor dynamical correlations on the multi-orbital Mott transition. In this case, some quantitative dependence on the parameterization is retained for the two-orbital model, for instance in the value of the critical interaction for a Mott transition.</p>

            <p>Systematic investigations of rare-earth ($R$) based intermetallic materials are a leading strategy to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing a range of physical phenomena, such as the formation of a Kondo lattice and competing electronic and magnetic anisotropies. In this work, the magnetic, thermal and transport properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals are presented. LaCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is characterized as a Pauli paramagnet and transport measurements, with the current along and perpendicular to the orthorhombic $c$-axis ($\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$, respectively), reveal a clear electronic anisotropy, with $\rho_{ab }\approx(4-7)\rho_{c }$ at $300$ K. We show that CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is a Kondo-lattice for which the Kondo coherence temperature $T_{\text{K}}^{*}$, deduced from broad maximums in $\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$ at $\approx$ 68 and 46 K, respectively, is also anisotropic. This finding is related to a possible underlying anisotropy of the Kondo coupling in CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$. The Pr- and Nd-based materials present strong easy-axis anisotropy ($c$-axis) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders below $T=4.84$ K and $T=8.1$ K, respectively. Metamagnetic transitions from this AFM to a spin-polarized paramagnetic phase state are investigated by isothermal magnetization measurements. The Sm-based compound is also an easy-axis AFM with a transition at $T=21.6$ K.</p>

This review article provides an overview of all currently known transverse thermoelectric conversion phenomena and principles, as well as their characteristics, and reclassifies them in a unified manner. The performance of the transverse thermoelectric generator, refrigerator, and active cooler is formulated, showing that thermal boundary conditions play an essential role to discuss their behaviors.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grayson R. Frazier, Junyi Zhang, Yi Li</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that coupling itinerant electrons to a noncollinear classical exchange field can induce anisotropic Josephson coupling between superconducting $d$-vectors, analogous to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and $\Gamma$-type interactions in magnetism. Using perturbative methods, we analyze an $s$-$d$ model on a geometrically frustrated lattice. Noncollinear local spin textures generate spin triplet pairing correlations and can favor spatially varying superconducting order due to anisotropic Josephson couplings between $d$-vectors, endowing a ``pliability'' to the pairing order that competes with the superfluid stiffness. For nonunitary pairing, this spatial texture of $d$-vectors can give rise to anomalous vortices in the absence of an external magnetic field. We further predict a Josephson diode effect with efficiency proportional to the spin chirality of the underlying magnetic texture. These results establish a link between frustrated magnetism and spatial textures of triplet superconducting pairing, with implications for a range of materials such as Mn$_3$Ge and $4$Hb-TaS$_2$, where superconductivity can be proximity-induced or intrinsic.</p>

            <h2>Superfluid stiffness bounds in time-reversal symmetric superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongxin Zeng, Andrew J. Millis</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry has been shown to make an important contribution to the superfluid stiffness of superconductors, especially for flat-band systems such as moiré materials. In this work we use mean-field theory to derive an expression for the superfluid stiffness of time-reversal symmetric superconductors at zero temperature by computing the energy of the mean-field ground state as a function of pairing momentum. We show that the quantum geometric contribution to superfluid stiffness is a consequence of broken Galilean invariance in the interaction Hamiltonian, arising from momentum-dependent form factors related to the momentum dependence of Bloch states. The effects of broken Galilean invariance are not fully parametrized by the quantum metric considered in previous work. We obtain general lower and upper bounds that apply to both continuum and lattice models and present numerical calculations of the precise value in several important cases. The superfluid stiffness of superconductivity in a Landau level saturates the lower bound and the superfluid stiffness of the other cases we consider is close to the general lower bound we derive. In multilayer rhombohedral graphene the geometric contribution is shown not to be the dominant contribution to the superfluid stiffness, despite the flat band behavior in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Finally, assuming contact interaction and uniform pairing, we show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the ``minimal quantum metric" introduced in previous work. We provide a continuum version of the minimal quantum metric and explain its physical origin.</p>

The effects of reduced dimensionality were systematically investigated using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Selected area electron diffraction (SAED), magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Semi-quantitative EDS analysis revealed a Ce:In ratio of 1:3.1(1), and the SAED results confirmed that the nanowires are polycrystalline with a cubic unit cell. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and NMR data indicated a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition to $T_N$ $\approx$ 2.4 K compared to the bulk value ($\approx$ 10 K). Furthermore, NMR analysis at temperatures below 2.8 K showed a reduced quadrupole frequency, $\nu_Q$ $\approx$ 1.77(2) MHz, and provided evidence of polycrystalline nanowires formed within the nanoporous alumina template, in agreement with SAED results.

            <h2>Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byjesh N. Radhakrishnan, Francesco Serafin, Thomas L. Schmidt, Étienne Fodor</p>
            <p>In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</p>

            <p>We report a significant reduction of low-temperature damping losses in tensile-strained, ultrathin Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films grown by pulsed laser deposition, exhibiting ultralow damping constants and tunable magnetic anisotropy. Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures, outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements and microstructural characterization, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Neural networks (NNs) have great potential in solving the ground state of various many-body problems. However, several key challenges remain to be overcome before NNs can tackle problems and system sizes inaccessible with more established tools. Here, we present a general and efficient method for learning the NN representation of an arbitrary many-body complex wave function from its $N$-particle probability density and probability current density. Having reached overlaps as large as $99.9\%$, we employ our neural wave function for pre-training to effortlessly solve the fractional quantum Hall problem with Coulomb interactions and realistic Landau-level mixing for as many as $25$ particles. Our work demonstrates efficient, accurate simulation of highly-entangled quantum matter using general-purpose deep NNs enhanced with physics-informed initialization.</p>

            <h2>Exact downfolding and its perturbative approximation</h2>

            <p>Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cristian Moreno-Pulido, Rachael Olwande, Tim Myers, Francesc Font</p>
            <p>The shrinking core model describes the reaction of a spherical solid particle with a surrounding fluid. In this work, we revisit the SCM by deriving it from the underlying physical processes and performing a careful non-dimensionalisation, which highlights the limitations of the commonly used pseudo-steady-state approximation, particularly in liquid-solid systems where fluid and solid densities are comparable. To address these limitations, we derive approximate analytical solutions using a perturbation method that improves upon the pseudo-steady-state model. We also obtain a small-time solution capturing early transient behavior. A semi-implicit finite difference scheme is implemented to solve the full model numerically and benchmark the analytical approximations. We demonstrate that the perturbation solution provides significantly improved accuracy over the pseudo-steady-state model, especially in diffusion-limited regimes. Finally, we propose a simple fitting procedure combining the perturbation with the early-time solutions to estimate physical parameters from experimental data at minimal computational cost.</p>

            <p>The role of Li-based batteries in the electrification of society cannot be understated, however their operational lifetime is often limited by the formation of dendrites, i.e. the localised deposition of Li that can cause shorts between the two electrodes leading to the failure of the battery. Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming "dead Li" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zesen Fu, Mengli Hu, Aolin Li, Haiming Duan, Junwei Liu, Fangping Ouyang</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical and first-principles study of a two-dimensional altermagnet exhibiting spin-valley locking and strain-tunable topological phases. By constructing a minimal tight-binding model constrained by altermagnetic symmetry, we show that biaxial strain can drive a transition from a trivial insulator to a type-II quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase. Furthermore, we derive an analytical strain-induced perturbation theory that identifies two critical curves, dividing the phase space into four regions corresponding to a trivial insulator, a type-II QSH phase, and two quantum anomalous Hall phases with opposite Chern numbers. Remarkably, the Chern number can be reversed purely by changing the strain direction --without modifying magnetization or applying magnetic fields. The model reveals a universal phase diagram for materials with the same symmetry and valley structure. First-principles calculations on monolayer CrO confirm the predicted topological transitions, establishing strain engineering as an effective route for topological control in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masoumeh Davoudiniya, Jonas Fransson, Biplab Sanyal</p>
            <p>$\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) exhibit magnetic zigzag edges, while other edge configurations are nonmagnetic. However, when the source, central, and drain regions of a logic device are all composed of zigzag BNRs (ZBNRs), the resulting spin polarization remains weak, unless a high voltage is applied. In this work, we demonstrate that lattice vibrations-introduced for example, via a thermal bath coupled to the central BNR-can enhance spin polarization in ZBNRs. This enhancement manifests as marked changes in the current-voltage characteristics, enabling direct experimental probing. In contrast, nonmagnetic edge configurations exhibit phonon-enhanced charge transport. We employ a tight-binding approach augmented with local electron-phonon interactions described by the Holstein model, and compute the phonon-renormalized Green's functions and transport currents using the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. The mechanism is supported by analyzing both spinless and spinful electronic dispersions and the corresponding density of states. Compared to the phonon-free edges, structural distortions lead to anisotropic electron-phonon couplings, which significantly modify both charge and spin transport. These results position phonon as an effective tuning parameter for optimizing borophene-based logic devices via engineered edge configurations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ran-Chen He, Jia-Xi Zeng, Shu Yang, Cong Wang, Qi-Jun Ye, Xin-Zheng Li</p>
            <p>To simulate indistinguishable particles, recent studies of path-integral molecular dynamics formulated their partition function $Z$ as a recurrence relation involving a variable $\xi$, with $\xi=1$(-1) for bosons (fermions). Inspired by Lee-Yang phase transition theory, we extend $\xi$ into the complex plane and reformulate $Z$ as a polynomial in $\xi$. By analyzing the distribution of the partition function zeros, we gain insights into the analytical properties of indistinguishable particles, particularly regarding the fermion sign problem (FSP). We found that at 0~K, the partition function zeros for $N$-particles are located at $\xi=-1$, $-1/2$, $-1/3$, $\cdots$, $-1/(N-1)$. This distribution disrupts the analytic continuation of thermodynamic quantities, expressed as functions of $\xi$ and typically performed along $\xi=1\to-1$, whenever the paths intersect these zeros. Moreover, we highlight the zero at $\xi = -1$, which induces an extra term in the free energy of the fermionic systems compared to ones at other $\xi=e^{i\theta}$ values. If a path connects this zero to a bosonic system with identical potential energies, it brings a transition resembling a phase transition. These findings provide a fresh perspective on the successes and challenges of emerging FSP studies based on analytic continuation techniques.</p>

            <p>Selenium is experiencing renewed interest as a elemental semiconductor for a range of optoelectronic and energy applications due to its irresistibly simple composition and favorable wide bandgap. However, its high volatility and low radiative efficiency make it challenging to assess structural and optoelectronic quality, calling for advanced, non-destructive characterization methods. In this work, we employ a closed-space encapsulation strategy to prevent degradation during measurement and enable sensitive probing of vibrational and optoelectronic properties. Using temperature-dependent Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, we investigate grown-in stress, vibrational dynamics, and electron-phonon interactions in selenium thin films synthesized under nominally identical conditions across different laboratories. Our results reveal that short-range structural disorder is not intrinsic to the material, but highly sensitive to subtle processing variations, which strongly influence electron-phonon coupling and non-radiative recombination. We find that such structural disorder and grown-in stress likely promote the formation of extended defects, which act as dominant non-radiative recombination centers limiting carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage in photovoltaic devices. These findings demonstrate that the optoelectronic quality of selenium thin films can be significantly improved through precise control of synthesis and post-deposition treatments, outlining a clear pathway toward optimizing selenium-based thin film technologies through targeted control of crystallization dynamics and microstructural disorder.</p>

            <p>Electronic nematic order is a correlated phase of matter in which low-energy electronic states spontaneously break a discrete rotational symmetry of a crystal lattice. Bilinear coupling between the electronic nematic and strains of the same symmetry yields a single pseudoproper ferroelastic phase transition at which both the nematic and lattice strain onset concurrently. To minimize elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). This technique combines high spatial and reciprocal-space resolution with full-field, bulk-sensitive imaging, enabling direct visualization of subdomain strain modulations emerging concurrently with the onset of nematic order. The elastic compatibility relations that govern inhomogeneous strains in continuous solids provide a natural mechanism for the emergent strain waves that we observe. Our findings reveal a broadly relevant form of strain self-organization and position DFXM as a powerful tool for probing the local interplay between lattice strain and electronic order.</p>

            <h2>Compatible Instability: Gauge Constraints of Elasticity Inherited by Electronic Nematic Criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. Joe Meese, Rafael M. Fernandes</p>
            <p>Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital, or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity, by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However, being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of domain formation.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Electronic Nematic Criticality Constrained by Elastic Compatibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. Joe Meese, Rafael M. Fernandes</p>
            <p>The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations. As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all crystalline systems.</p>

            <p>Neural quantum states (NQS) provide flexible wavefunction parameterizations for numerical studies of quantum many-body physics. While inspired by deep learning, it remains unclear to what extent NQS share characteristics with neural networks used for standard machine learning tasks. We demonstrate that NQS exhibit the double descent phenomenon, a key feature of modern deep learning, where generalization worsens as network size increases before improving again in an overparameterized regime. Notably, we find the second descent to occur only for network sizes much larger than the Hilbert space dimension, indicating that NQS typically operate in an underparameterized regime, where increasing network size can degrade generalization. Our analysis reveals that the optimal network size in this regime depends on the number of unique training samples, highlighting the importance of sampling strategies. These findings suggest the need for symmetry-aware, physics-informed architecture design, rather than directly adopting machine learning heuristics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donghoon Kim, Tomotaka Kuwahara, Keiji Saito</p>
            <p>The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha> \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha < D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha > D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha > (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.</p>

We present evidence of a new type of phase transition, surprisingly controlled by the cooperativeness parameter, rather than the spatial density or the diagonal disorder. The numerical results corroborate the occurrence of such a phase transition at a critical value of the cooperativeness parameter, above which the lower edge of the spectrum vanishes exhibiting a macroscopic accumulation of eigenvalues. Independent evaluations based on the two phenomena provide the same value of the critical cooperativeness parameter.</p>

For initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks under Gaussian random local dynamics. In addition, we show that randomness in the Hamiltonian causes the tripartite mutual information to saturate at relatively large negative values. Therefore, despite being integrable, these systems exhibit information-scrambling diagnostics that mirror those observed in chaotic systems. We note, however, that random quadratic Hamiltonians can have a component exhibiting Wigner-Dyson energy-level statistics; for non-Gaussian states within the corresponding subspace, these systems can display chaotic behavior. Our results provide insight into the Gaussian dynamics of continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Collective behaviours are frequently observed to self-organise to criticality. Existing proposals to explain these phenomena are fragmented across disciplines and only partially answer the question. This primer compares the underlying, intrinsic, utilities that may explain the self-organisation of collective behaviours near criticality. We focus on information-driven approaches (predictive information, empowerment, and active inference), as well as an approach incorporating both information theory and thermodynamics (thermodynamic efficiency). By interpreting the Ising model as a perception-action loop, we compare how different intrinsic utilities shape collective behaviour and analyse the distinct characteristics that arise when each is optimised. In particular, we highlight that thermodynamic efficiency -- measuring the ratio of predictability gained by the system to its energy costs -- reaches its maximum at the critical regime. Finally, we propose the Principle of Super-efficiency, suggesting that collective behaviours self-organise to the critical regime where optimal efficiency is achieved with respect to the entropy reduction relative to the thermodynamic costs.</p>

            <p>Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</p>

            <p>We conduct a mode analysis of a general $U(1)$-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of effective field theory for dissipative fluids in flat Minkowski spacetime. We derive the most general quadratic action for hydrodynamic modes, including stochastic noise, and analyze the corresponding dispersion relations in a consistent gradient expansion. We argue that spontaneous breaking of spacetime symmetry arises in the presence of a local thermal state specified by a local timelike four-vector. We demonstrate that hydrodynamical perturbations can be identified as Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes, analogous to their embedding in global $U(1)$-invariant theories. We find that frame-invariant combinations of hydrodynamic transport coefficients determine the first-order dispersion relations in the low-energy limit, making the mode analysis manifestly independent of the choice of hydrodynamic frame. Assuming local Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry and unitarity of the underlying UV theory, we show that first-order hydrodynamics is stable if the enthalpy density is positive.</p>

            <p>An arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method and numerical implementation for curved and deforming lipid membranes is presented here. The membrane surface is endowed with a mesh whose in-plane motion need not depend on the in-plane flow of lipids. Instead, in-plane mesh dynamics can be specified arbitrarily. A new class of mesh motions is introduced, where the mesh velocity satisfies the dynamical equations of a user-specified two-dimensional material. A Lagrange multiplier constrains the out-of-plane membrane and mesh velocities to be equal, such that the mesh and material always overlap. An associated numerical inf--sup instability ensues, and is removed by adapting established techniques in the finite element analysis of fluids. In our implementation, the aforementioned Lagrange multiplier is projected onto a discontinuous space of piecewise linear functions. The new mesh motion is compared to established Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations by investigating a preeminent numerical benchmark of biological significance: the pulling of a membrane tether from a flat patch, and its subsequent lateral translation.</p>

            <p>Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.</p>

            <h2>Fragile topology on solid grounds: a mathematical perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Becker, Zhongkai Tao, Mengxuan Yang</p>
            <p>This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.</p>

            <h2>The "double" square-root law: Evidence for the mechanical origin of market impact using Tokyo Stock Exchange data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Maitrier, Grégoire Loeper, Kiyoshi Kanazawa, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud</p>
            <p>Understanding the impact of trades on prices is a crucial question for both academic research and industry practice. It is well established that impact follows a square-root impact as a function of traded volume. However, the microscopic origin of such a law remains elusive: empirical studies are particularly challenging due to the anonymity of orders in public data. Indeed, there is ongoing debate about whether price impact has a mechanical origin or whether it is primarily driven by information, as suggested by many economic theories. In this paper, we revisit this question using a very detailed dataset provided by the Japanese stock exchange, containing the trader IDs for all orders sent to the exchange between 2012 and 2018. Our central result is that such a law has in fact microscopic roots and applies already at the level of single child orders, provided one waits long enough for the market to "digest" them. The mesoscopic impact of metaorders arises from a "double" square-root effect: square-root in volume of individual impact, followed by an inverse square-root decay as a function of time. Since market orders are anonymous, we expect and indeed find that these results apply to any market orders, and the impact of synthetic metaorders, reconstructed by scrambling the identity of the issuers, is described by the very same square-root impact law. We conclude that price impact is essentially mechanical, at odds with theories that emphasize the information content of such trades to explain the square-root impact law.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium Critical Scaling of a Squeezing Phase Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arman Duha, S. E. Begg, Thomas Bilitewski</p>
            <p>We investigate phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of power-law interacting spin-1/2 bilayer XXZ models, which have recently been shown to allow generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing. We find a transition between a collective phase characterized by Heisenberg limited squeezing and a partially collective phase with scalable squeezing. We identify universal scaling of the squeezing dynamics in terms of system parameters and a divergent time-scale, establishing these as distinct dynamical phases within the framework of non-equilibrium critical phenomena. Our work demonstrates a novel dynamical phase transition with potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation in cold-atomic, molecular or Rydberg platforms.</p>

            <h2>O(5) multicriticality in the 3D two flavor SU(2) lattice gauge Higgs model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Bonati, Ivan Soler Calero</p>
            <p>We numerically investigate the multicritical behavior of the three dimensional lattice system in which a SU(2) gauge field is coupled to two flavors of scalar fields transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this system a multicritical point is present, where the global symmetry O(2)$\oplus$O(3) gets enlarged to O(5). Such a symmetry enlargement is hindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical point, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term triggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice gauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\oplus$O(3) multicritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible implications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a sophisticated tool for cost-efficient atomistic simulations approaching DFT accuracy, with recent message passing MLFFs able to cover the entire periodic table. We present an invariant message passing MLFF architecture (MPNICE) which iteratively predicts atomic partial charges, including long-range interactions, enabling the prediction of charge-dependent properties while achieving 5-20x faster inference versus models with comparable accuracy. We train direct and delta-learned MPNICE models for organic systems, and benchmark against experimental properties of liquid and solid systems. We also benchmark the energetics of finite systems, contributing a new set of torsion scans with charged species and a new set of DLPNO-CCSD(T) references for the TorsionNet500 benchmark. We additionally train and benchmark MPNICE models for bulk inorganic crystals, focusing on structural ranking and mechanical properties. Finally, we explore multi-task models for both inorganic and organic systems, which exhibit slightly decreased performance on domain-specific tasks but surprising generalization, stably predicting the gas phase structure of $\simeq500$ Pt/Ir organometallic complexes despite never training to organometallic complexes of any kind.</p>

            <h2>Collective Modes in Weyl Superconductors and the Axial Anomaly</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehran Z-Abyaneh</p>
            <p>We write the Lagrangian of a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor in a covariant form. Then, based on an analogy with the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model and by employing the Fierz transformations, we demonstrate that new collective modes should exist in such a system, including a pseudo-scalar Nambu-Goldstone boson and its corresponding amplitude mode plus a vector and an axial-vector collective mode. It is also observed that the pseudo-scalar mode can become massive due to an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term in the Lagrangian. Analogous to pions in low-energy QCD, such a massive pseudo-scalar mode can decay via the axial anomaly.</p>

            <h2>The Enduring Relevance of Semiempirical Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan E. Moussa</p>
            <p>The development of semiempirical models to simplify quantum mechanical descriptions of atomistic systems is a practice that started soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics and continues to the present day. There are now many methods for atomistic simulation with many software implementations and many users, on a scale large enough to be considered as a software market. Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous flow in correlated quantum systems: No-go result and multiple-charge scenario</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Guan, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>Correlated quantum systems can exhibit thermodynamic behaviors that defy classical expectations, with anomalous energy flow (AEF) against temperature gradients serving as a paradigmatic example. While AEF has been shown to arise from the consumption of initial quantum correlations, little is known about whether AEF can occur without correlation depletion, or if analogous anomalous transport exists for conserved quantities--dubbed charges--other than energy. Here, we develop a general global-local thermodynamic approach to describe charge exchange between arbitrary correlated quantum systems. For energy-conserving systems, we analytically rule out AEF in initially uncorrelated states, even with the involvement of quantum catalysts, thereby complementing existing studies. In contrast, in systems with multiple conserved charges, we uncover a mechanism for AEF that requires no initial correlations but is instead induced by a drag effect from normal flows of non-energy charges. Furthermore, by treating all conserved charges on equal footing, we generalize AEF to a broader concept of anomalous charge flow, applicable to any conserved charge. We confirm theoretical expectations with numerical examples. These findings deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and open new avenues for controlling transport phenomena in correlated quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emad Chaparian</p>
            <p>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of flow when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</p>

            <h2>Landauer Principle and Thermodynamics of Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pritam Chattopadhyay, Avijit Misra, Tanmoy Pandit, Goutam Paul</p>
            <p>According to the Landauer principle, any logically irreversible process accompanies entropy production, which results in heat dissipation in the environment. Erasing of information, one of the primary logically irreversible processes, has a lower bound on heat dissipated into the environment, called the Landauer bound (LB). However, the practical erasure processes dissipate much more heat than the LB. Recently, there have been a few experimental investigations to reach this bound both in the classical and quantum domains. There has also been a spate of activities to enquire about this LB in finite time, with finite-size heat baths, non-Markovian and nonequilibrium environments in the quantum regime, where the effects of fluctuations and correlation of the systems with the bath can no longer be ignored. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the Landauer bound, which serves as a fundamental principle in the thermodynamics of computation. We also provide a perspective for future endeavors in these directions. Furthermore, we review the recent explorations toward establishing energetic bounds of a computational process. We also discuss the thermodynamic aspects of error correction, which is an indispensable part of information processing and computations. In doing so, we briefly discuss the basics of these fields to provide a complete picture.</p>

            <h2>Probing broken time-reversal symmetry with tailored-light photocurrents</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel M. B. Lesko, Tobias Weitz, Simon Wittigschlager, Selina Nöcker, Weizhe Li, Peter Hommelhoff, Ofer Neufeld</p>
            <p>Light-field-driven photocurrents represent a powerful tool for generating photocurrents without external bias in light-matter systems that lack inversion symmetry. While these photocurrents are used in electronic applications, such as current sources, switches, and photovoltaics, their presence can also be used to probe material properties in and out of equilibrium, such as topology. Here we advance this path of light-field-driven photocurrent spectroscopy by utilizing tailored laser fields for ultrafast photocurrent generation to study time-reversal symmetry (TRS) broken phases. We employ combinations of bichromatic linearly-polarized laser beams that individually respect mirror (spatial) and time-reversal symmetry, individually precluding photocurrents, but when combined can break symmetries and generate photocurrents. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that unique choices of the relative polarization angle and two-color phase imposes a forbidden photocurrent selection rule in TRS-invariant systems, as the tailored light maintains TRS while breaking all other spatial symmetries. We then employ state-of-the-art ab-initio simulations to validate this physical mechanism, and, crucially, predict its breaking in materials with intrinsically-broken TRS, creating a background free signal for magnetism and Chern physics. Our work paves way for probing TRS-broken phases of matter in an ultrafast time-resolved manner, not requiring the application of external magnetic fields or even circularly-polarized electric fields.</p>
