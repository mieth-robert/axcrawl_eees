            <h2>Observing structural disorder induced interacting topological phase in an atom array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zongpei Yue, Yu-Feng Mao, Xinhui Liang, Zhen-Xing Hua, Peiyun Ge, Yu-Xin Chao, Kai Li, Chen Jia, Meng Khoon Tey, Yong Xu, Li You</p>
            <p>Topological phases of matter can appear in noninteracting systems, as in band topology, or interacting systems, such as in spin models, with their defining features typically robust against weak disorder. Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <h2>Manipulating the topological spin of Majoranas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stijn R. de Wit, Emre Duman, A. Mert Bozkurt, Alexander Brinkman, Inanc Adagideli</p>
            <p>The non-Abelian exchange statistics of Majorana zero modes make them interesting for both technological applications and fundamental research. Unlike their non-Abelian counterpart, the Abelian contribution $e^{i \theta}$, where $\theta$ is directly related to the Majorana's topological spin, is often neglected. However, the Abelian exchange phase and hence the topological spin can differ from system to system. For vortices in topological superconductors, the Abelian exchange phase is interpreted as an Aharonov-Casher phase arising from a vortex encircling an $e/4$ charge. In this work, we show how this fractional charge and hence the topological spin can be manipulated, introducing an additional knob for braiding operations in topological quantum computing. To probe this effect, we propose a vortex interference experiment that reveals the effect of this fractional charge through measurable shifts in the critical current.</p>

            <h2>Emergent magnetism and spin liquids in an extended Hubbard description of moiré bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenhao Song, Urban F. P. Seifert, Leon Balents, Hong-Chen Jiang</p>
            <p>Motivated by twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study an extended Hubbard model with both on-site and off-site repulsive interactions, in which Mott insulating states with concomitant charge order occur at fractional fillings. To resolve the charge ordering as well as the fate of the local moments formed thereby, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on cylindrical geometries for several filling fractions and ranges of interaction strength. Depending on the precise parameter regime, both antiferromagnetically ordered as well as quantum-disordered states are found, with a particularly prominent example being a quantum spin liquid-type ground state on top of charge-ordering with effective Kagomé geometry. We discuss the different mechanisms at play in stabilizing various electronic and magnetic states. The results suggest that moiré TMDs are a promising venue for emergent quantum magnetism of strongly interacting electrons.</p>

            <h2>From continuum excitations to sharp magnons via transverse magnetic field in the spin-1/2 Ising-like triangular lattice antiferromagnet Na2BaCo(PO4)2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonie Woodland, Ryutaro Okuma, J. Ross Stewart, Christian Balz, Radu Coldea</p>
            <p>We report high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the excitation spectrum in large single crystals of the spin-1/2 triangular lattice Ising-like antiferromagnet Na2BaCo(PO4)2 in magnetic fields applied transverse to the Ising axis. In the high-field polarized phase above a critical field $B_{C}$ we observe sharp magnons, as expected in the case of no exchange disorder. Through simultaneous fits to the dispersions including data in polarizing field along the Ising axis, we obtain an excellent match to an Ising-like XXZ Hamiltonian and rule out previously proposed Kitaev exchanges. In the intermediate-field phase below $B_{C}$, we observe three dispersive modes, out of which only the lowest energy one is sharp and the others are broad and overlap with continuum scattering. We propose that the broadening effects are due to magnon decays into two-magnon excitations and confirm that such processes are kinematically allowed. The continuum scattering becomes progressively stronger upon lowering field and, at 0.25 T and zero field, it dominates the complete spectrum with no clear evidence for even broadened magnon modes. We discuss the relevance of the continuous manifold of mean-field degenerate ground states of the refined Hamiltonian for capturing the observed spectrum in zero field, and compare the data with the one- and two-magnon spectrum averaged over this manifold. We also propose a model of the interlayer couplings to explain the observed finite interlayer magnetic propagation vector of the zero-field magnetic order; this requires the breaking of the mirror symmetry in the nominal P-3m1 space group and through refinement of x-ray diffraction data on an untwinned single crystal, we indeed confirm a rotation of the CoO6 octahedra around the c-axis, which lowers the symmetry to P-3.</p>

            <h2>Magnetothermal Properties with Sampled Effective Local Field Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Brawand, Nima Leclerc, Emiko Zumbro</p>
            <p>We introduce a first-principles method for predicting the magnetothermal properties of solid-state materials, which we call Sampled Effective Local Field Estimation. This approach achieves over two orders of magnitude improvement in sample efficiency compared to current state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated on representative material systems. We validate our predictions against experimental data for well-characterized magnetic materials, showing excellent agreement. The method is fully automated and requires minimal computational resources, making it well suited for integration into high-throughput materials discovery workflows. Our method offers a scalable and accurate predictive framework that can accelerate the design of next-generation materials for magnetic refrigeration, cryogenic cooling, and magnetic memory technologies.</p>

            <h2>Band topology and dynamic multiferroicity induced from dynamical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in centrosymmetric lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Ma, Z. D. Wang</p>
            <p>We develop a theory of a dynamical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (dDMI) in centrosymmetric crystals by generally considering the vibration of both cations and anions. It gives rise to an antisymmetric spin-lattice coupling, inducing magnon-phonon hybridized topological excitations. Moreover, we find that this dDMI naturally exhibits a magnetoelectric feature, leading to the presence of dynamic multiferroicity with finite toroidal moment distribution in the momentum space. By comparing the toroidal moments with the band skyrmion structure, we reveal the intrinsic connection between band topology and dynamic multiferroicity through the dDMI.</p>

            <h2>Optically induced spin Hall current in Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoaki Kameda, Katsunori Wakabayashi</p>
            <p>Monolayer Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as WSeTe, exhibit Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC) due to broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that pure spin Hall currents can be generated under light irradiation based on a tight-binding model. Rashba-type SOC plays a crucial role in determining the spin polarization direction and enhancing the generation efficiency of pure spin Hall currents. Our findings establish Janus TMDCs as promising materials for next-generation optospintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Interface-Bound States and Majorana Zero Modes in Lateral Heterostructures of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with Proximity-Induced Superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoonkang Kim</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive investigation into the emergence of interface-bound states, particularly Majorana zero modes (MZMs), in a lateral heterostructure composed of two three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, under the influence of proximity-induced superconductivity from niobium (Nb) contacts. We develop an advanced two-dimensional Dirac model for the topological surface states (TSS), incorporating spatially varying chemical potentials and s-wave superconducting pairing. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism, we derive analytical solutions for the bound states and compute the local density of states (LDOS) at the interface, revealing zero-energy modes characteristic of MZMs. The topological nature of these states is rigorously analyzed through winding numbers and Pfaffian invariants, and their robustness is explored under various physical perturbations, including gating effects. Our findings highlight the potential of this heterostructure as a platform for topological quantum computing, with detailed predictions for experimental signatures via tunneling spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>Superradiance Enhanced Light-Matter Interaction in Spatially Ordered Shape and Volume Controlled Single Quantum Dots: Enabling On-Chip Photonic Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Jordao, Qi Huang, Swarnabha Chattaraj, Siyuan Lu, Jiefei Zhang, Anupam Madhukar</p>
            <p>On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, characteristic of a delicate balance between the confinement potential volume, depth, and the resulting binding energy of the center of mass motion of the exciton and the exciton binding energy. In the exciton's weak confinement regime, direct enhancement of the quantum dot oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated for emitters in large arrays. Our findings provide compelling incentive for investigations of the potential of SESRE based tailored MTSQDs of lattice matched and mismatched material combinations for fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by these unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units.</p>

            <h2>Observation of returning Thouless pumping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheyu Cheng, Sijie Yue, Yang Long, Wentao Xie, Zixuan Yu, Hau Tian Teo, Y. X. Zhao, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang</p>
            <p>Introduced by David Thouless in 1983, Thouless pumping exemplifies topological properties in topological systems, where the transported charge is quantized by the Chern number. Recently, returning Thouless pumping was theoretically proposed, in which quantized charge is pumped during the first half of the cycle but returns to zero in the second half. This mechanism leads to crystalline symmetry-protected delicate topological insulators. Unlike conventional topological bands, a delicate topological band is Wannierizable but not atomically obstructed, which features multicellular Wannier functions extending beyond a single unit cell. Here, by replacing the second dimension with a synthetic dimension, we realize a two-dimensional delicate topological insulator via a set of one-dimensional acoustic crystals with fine-tuned geometric parameters. Through acoustic bands and wavefunction measurements, we directly observe returning Thouless pumping and symmetric multicellular Wannier functions, followed by establishing the bulk-boundary correspondence between sub-Brillouin zone Chern numbers and gapless boundary modes. As enriched by crystalline symmetries, our experimental demonstration of returning Thouless pumping expands the current understanding of topological phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>Electroforming Kinetics in HfOx/Ti RRAM: Mechanisms Behind Compositional and Thermal Engineering</h2>

            <p>A critical issue affecting filamentary resistive random access memory (RRAM) cells is the requirement of high voltages during electroforming. Reducing the magnitude of these voltages is of significant interest, as it ensures compatibility with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Previous studies have identified that changing the initial stoichiometry of the switching layer and/or implementing thermal engineering approaches has an influence over the electroforming voltage magnitude, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we develop an understanding of how these mechanisms work within a standard a-HfO$_x$/Ti RRAM stack through combining atomistic driven-Kinetic Monte Carlo (d-KMC) simulations with experimental data. By performing device-scale simulations at atomistic resolution, we can precisely model the movements of point defects under applied biases in structurally inhomogeneous materials, which allows us to not only capture finite-size effects but also to understand how conductive filaments grow under different electroforming conditions. Doing atomistic simulations at the device-level also enables us to link simulations of the mechanisms behind conductive filament formation with trends in experimental data with the same material stack. We identify a transition from primarily vertical to lateral ion movement dominating the filamentary growth process in sub-stoichiometric oxides, and differentiate the influence of global and local heating on the morphology of the formed filaments. These different filamentary structures have implications for the dynamic range exhibited by formed devices in subsequent SET/RESET operations. Overall, our results unify the complex ion dynamics in technologically relevant HfO$_x$/Ti-based stacks, and provide guidelines that can be leveraged when fabricating devices.</p>

            <h2>Magnetization Dependent In-plane Anomalous Hall Effect in a Low-dimensional System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I-Hsuan Kao, Ravi Kumar Bandapelli, Zhenhong Cui, Shuchen Zhang, Jian Tang, Tiema Qian, Souvik Sasmal, Aalok Tiwari, Mei-Tung Chen, Rahul Rao, Jiahan Li, James H. Edgar, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ni Ni, Su-Yang Xu, Qiong Ma, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Jyoti Katoch, Simranjeet Singh</p>
            <p>Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) response in magnetic systems is typically proportional to an out-of-plane magnetization component because of the restriction imposed by system symmetries, which demands that the magnetization, applied electric field, and induced Hall current are mutually orthogonal to each other. Here, we report experimental realization of an unconventional form of AHE in a low-dimensional heterostructure, wherein the Hall response is not only proportional to the out-of-plane magnetization component but also to the in-plane magnetization component. By interfacing a low-symmetry topological semimetal (TaIrTe4) with the ferromagnetic insulator (Cr2Ge2Te6), we create a low-dimensional magnetic system, where only one mirror symmetry is preserved. We show that as long as the magnetization has a finite component in the mirror plane, this last mirror symmetry is broken, allowing the emergence of an AHE signal proportional to in-plane magnetization. Our experiments, conducted on multiple devices, reveal a gate-voltage-dependent AHE response, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms responsible for the Hall effect in our system can be tuned via electrostatic gating. A minimal microscopic model constrained by the symmetry of the heterostructure shows that both interfacial spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry breaking via the exchange interaction from magnetization are responsible for the emergence of the in-plane AHE. Our work highlights the importance of system symmetries and exchange interaction in low-dimensional heterostructures for designing novel and tunable Hall effects in layered quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous Enhancement of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction via Field-Cooling-Induced Interface Engineering in 2D van der Waals Ferromagnetic ternary Tellurides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shian Xia, Yan Luo, Iftikhar Ahmed Malik, Xinyi Zhou, Keying Han, Yue Sun, Haoyun Lin, Hanqing Shi, Yingchun Cheng, Vanessa Li Zhang, Yi Du, Sheng Liu, Chao Zhu, Ting Yu</p>
            <p>The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets has opened new avenues for exploring topological spin textures and their applications in next-generation spintronics. Among these materials, Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT) emerges as a model system due to its room-temperature skyrmion phases, which are stabilized by strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, the atomistic origins of DMI in centrosymmetric vdW lattices remain elusive. Here, we report a spontaneous DMI enhancement mechanism driven by FC in FGaT and its analog Fe3GeTe2 (FGeT). Combining Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we have observed the irreversible precipitation of FeTe2 in annealed FGaT. The resulting FeTe2/FGaT heterostructure is considered to break the symmetry and significantly enhance the DMI. Furthermore, similar phenomenon has been observed in the family ferromagnetic material FGeT as well. Additionally, the precipitation of FeTe2 varies significantly with different thicknesses of FGaT, aligning closely with the reported behavior of skyrmions. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms behind the origin of the DMI in ternary tellurides, paving the way for advanced spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Strong Crystalline Thermal Insulating Induced by Extended Antibonding States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruihuan Cheng, Chen Wang, Niuchang Ouyang, Xingchen Shen, Yue Chen</p>
            <p>Crystalline solids with extreme insulation often exhibit a plateau or even an upward-sloping tail in thermal conductivity above room temperature. Herein, we synthesized a crystalline material AgTl$_2$I$_3$ with an exceptionally low thermal conductivity of 0.21 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, which continues to decrease to 0.17 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 523 K. We adopted an integrated experimental and theoretical approach to reveal the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of AgTl$_2$I$_3$. Our results suggest that the Ag-I polyhedron enables extended antibonding states to weaken the chemical bonding, fostering strong lattice anharmonicity driven by the rattling vibrations of Ag atoms and causing lattice softening. Experimental measurements further corroborate the large atomic thermal motions and low sound velocity. These features impede particle-like phonon propagation, and significantly diminish the contribution of wave-like phonon tunneling. This work highlights a strategy for designing thermal insulating materials by leveraging crystal structure and chemical bonding, providing a pathway for advancing the development of thermal insulators.</p>

            <h2>Surface hopping simulations show valley depolarization driven by exciton-phonon resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Krotz, Roel Tempelaar</p>
            <p>Monolayer MoS$_2$ has long served as a prototypical material exhibiting valleytronic behavior, yet it remains unclear exactly how phonons induce a valley depolarization of its excitonic states. Here, we apply a mixed quantum--classical simulation framework to study the phonon-induced mechanisms affecting valley polarization at short times. Our framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure as well as the electron-hole and carrier-phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations, while retaining explicit information on transient phonon occupancies. By means of such occupancies, our simulations show a resonance between the lowest exciton band and the dominant optical phonon branch to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle-Silva-Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin J. U. Vidarte, A. B. Felix, A. Latgé</p>
            <p>Novel physical properties have been reported recently by stacking graphene-like systems in different configurations. Here, we explore the nature of emergent localized states at the edges of twisted bilayer graphene nanoribbons. Based on an extended tight-binding Hamiltonian, which includes hopping energy within a wide atomic neighborhood, we investigate the nature of the electronic states responsible for the transport along the four graphene nanoribbon terminals. The emphasis is on discussing the role of the stacking region symmetries, the twisted angle between the crossed zigzag nanoribbons, and also the width of the ribbons in the electronic and transport responses of the four terminals. Our findings show a direct connection between the number of non-equivalent sites on the edge of the stacking region and the localized states, in accordance with reported scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. Within the parameters explored, the twist angle was revealed to be the most powerful tool to control transport responses in the investigated 4-terminal devices, including special electronic beam splitter phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Excitons in fractionally-filled moiré superlattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junghwan Kim, Hanan Dery, Dinh Van Tuan</p>
            <p>Long-range Coulomb forces give rise to correlated insulating states when charge particles populate a moiré superlattice at certain fractional filling factors. Such behavior is characterized by a broken translation symmetry wherein particles spontaneously form a Wigner crystal. Focusing on the experimental findings of Xu et al. [Nature \textbf{587}, 214 (2020)], we present a theory that captures the correlated insulating state of a fractionally-filled moiré superlattice through the energy shift and change in oscillator strength of the exciton absorption resonance. The theory shows that the experimental findings can only be supported if the electrons reside in a charge-ordered state (i.e., electrons are not randomly distributed among the sites of the moiré superlattice). Furthermore, we explain why the energy shifts of exciton resonances are qualitatively different in cases that the superlattice is nearly empty compared with a superlattice whose sites are doubly occupied.</p>

            <p>We report on the observation of an excited 2s state of a trion in a 4.2 nm wide doped GaAs/Al(0.3)Ga(0.7)As quantum well (QW) using magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) spectroscopy under out-of-plane magnetic fields up to 6 T. This resonance appears slightly below the 2s exciton in energy. Strikingly, the 2s trion is found to be bound only for magnetic fields larger than 1 T. The signature of the 2s trion is absent in the magneto-reflectance spectra, while it is detectable in the MOKE spectra signifying the importance of the powerful technique. Similar to the 1s states, the 2s trion shows an opposite degree of magnetic-field-induced polarization compared to its exciton counterpart, in agreement with our theoretical calculations. This transfer of oscillator strength between the complexes establishes an optical fingerprint of the 2s excited trion.</p>

            <h2>Probing quantum phase transition in a staggered Bosonic Kitaev chain via layer-resolved localization-delocalization transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Wang, X. Z. Zhang</p>
            <p>The bosonic statistics, which allow for macroscopic multi-occupancy of single-particle states, pose significant challenges for analyzing quantum phase transitions in interacting bosonic systems, both analytically and numerically. In this work, we systematically investigate the non-Hermitian Bloch core matrix of a Hermitian staggered bosonic Kitaev chain, formulated within the Nambu framework. We derive explicit analytic conditions for the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the $4\times 4$ Bloch core matrix, with each EP marking the onset of complex-conjugate eigenvalue pairs. By mapping the full many-body Hamiltonian onto an effective tight-binding network in Fock-space and introducing layer-resolved inverse participation ratio, we demonstrate that these EPs coincide precisely with sharp localization--delocalization transitions of collective eigenstates. Comprehensive numerical analyses across hopping amplitudes, pairing strengths, and on-site potentials confirm that the EP of effective Hamiltonian universally capture the global many-body phase boundaries. Our results establish an analytically tractable, EP-based criterion for detecting critical behavior in interacting bosonic lattices, with direct relevance to photonic and cold-atom experimental platforms.</p>

            <h2>Ab-initio density-matrix approach to exciton coherence: phonon scattering, Coulomb interactions and radiative recombination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomer Amit, Guy Vosco, Mauro Del Ben, Sivan Refaely-Abramson</p>
            <p>Relaxation processes following light excitation in semiconductors are key in materials-based quantum technology applications. These processes are broadly studied in atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), quasi-two-dimensional excitonic semiconductors in which atomistic design allows for tunable excited-state properties, such as relaxation lifetimes and photo-induced coherence. In this work, we present a density-matrix-based approach to compute exciton relaxation within a many-body ab initio perspective. We expand our previously developed Lindblad density-matrix formalism to capture multi-channel electron-hole pair relaxation processes, including phonon and Coulomb scattering as well as radiative recombination, and study their effect on the time-resolved excited-state propagation. Using monolayer MoSe$_2$ as a prototypical example, we examine many-body effects on the time-dependent dynamics of photoactive excitations, exploring how the electron-hole pair interactions are reflected in variations of the excitation energy, spectral signature, and state coherence. Our method supplies a detailed understanding of exciton relaxation mechanisms in realistic materials, offering a previously unexplored pathway to study excited-state dynamics in semiconductors from first principles.</p>

            <h2>Temperature chaos may emerge many thermodynamic states in spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenlong Wang</p>
            <p>We present a large-scale simulation of the three-dimensional and mean-field spin glasses down to a very low but finite temperature. We extrapolate pertinent observables, e.g., the disorder-averaged central weight to zero temperature, finding that many thermodynamic states at a finite temperature and two ground states at zero temperature are fully compatible. While the disorder-averaged central weight monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature, this is far from true for individual samples. This motivates us to link this behaviour with the well-known temperature chaos. At an observing temperature, a sample may or may not have pure state coexistence depending on whether it is undergoing temperature chaos, which is a random process. Therefore, temperature chaos is likely responsible for the emergence of many pure states, providing a natural and intuitive explanation for the coexistence of expensive domain-wall excitations and many pure states at the disorder-averaged level.</p>

            <h2>Estimating critical disorder strength of an AAH system via thermal response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchita Nandi, Santanu K. Maiti</p>
            <p>The Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model provides a paradigmatic platform to study localization phenomena, where a transition from a conducting to an insulating phase occurs at a critical disorder strength equal to twice the nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude, $2t$. While this transition has been explored extensively through various probes, here we propose a fundamentally new approach based on thermal response. Specifically, we demonstrate that the electronic specific heat exhibits a distinctive signature across the transition, directly reflecting the anomalous evolution of the density of states with disorder strength. Our findings, supported by numerical analysis, establish specific heat measurement as a powerful and sensitive probe for detecting the critical point.

            <h2>Fermi liquid theory of $d$-wave altermagnets: demon modes and Fano-demon states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Habib Rostami, Johannes Hofmann</p>
            <p>We develop a Fermi liquid theory of $d$-wave altermagnets and apply it to describe their collective excitation spectrum. We predict that in addition to a conventional undamped plasmon mode, where both spin components oscillate in phase, there is an acoustic plasmon (or {\em demon}) mode with out-of-phase spin dynamics. By analyzing the dynamical structure factor, we reveal a strong dependence of the demon's frequency and spectral weight both on the Landau parameters and on the direction of propagation. Notably, as a function of the propagation angle, we show that the acoustic mode evolves from a {\em hidden state}, which has zero spectral weight in the density excitation spectrum, to a weakly damped propagating demon mode and then to a {\em Fano-demon mixed state}, which is marked by a strong hybridization with particle-hole excitations and a corresponding asymmetric line shape in the structure factor. Our study paves the way for applications of altermagnetic materials in opto-spintronics by harnessing itinerant electron spin oscillations beyond traditional magnon spin waves.</p>

            <p>Gas hydrates are considered fundamental building blocks of giant icy planets like Neptune and similar exoplanets. The existence of these materials in the interiors of giant icy planets, which are subject to high pressures and temperatures, depends on their stability relative to their constituent components. In this study, we reexamine the structural stability and hydrogen content of hydrogen hydrates, (H2O)(H2)n, up to 104 GPa, focusing on hydrogen-rich materials. Using synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles theoretical calculations, we find that the C2-filled ice phase undergoes a transformation to C3-filled ice phase over a broad pressure range of 47 - 104 GPa at room temperature. The C3 phase contains twice as much molecular H2 as the C2 phase. Heating the C2-filled ice above approximately 1500 K induces the transition to the C3 phase at pressures as low as 47 GPa. Upon decompression, this phase remains metastable down to 40 GPa. These findings establish new stability limits for hydrates, with implications for hydrogen storage and the interiors of planetary bodies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel A. Andreev</p>
            <p>The contribution of the polarization associated with the noncollinear parts of spins in the dielectric permeability tensor of multiferroic materials is considered. As the equilibrium state, we consider the systems of parallel spins, so we have zero equilibrium polarization. Dynamical polarization appears due to the spin evolution via the magnetoelectric coupling. The regime of frequencies, where the refractive index goes to 1 is found for the high (in comparison with the characteristic frequency of the anisotropic energy or the cyclotron frequency) left/right circularly polarized electromagnetic wave propagating parallel to the equilibrium spin direction. Moreover, the signs of the imaginary part of the dielectric permeability, the refractive index, and the frequency show the instability of the parallel spin configuration at the propagation of the linearly polarized electromagnetic wave due to the effective magnetoelectric interaction.</p>

            <h2>Buckling of residually stressed cylindrical tubes under compression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Zhang, Luis Dorfmann, Yang Liu</p>
            <p>We evaluate the loss of stability of axially compressed slender and thick-walled tubes subject to a residual stress distribution. The nonlinear theory of elasticity, when used to analyze the underlying deformation, shows that the residual stress induces preferred directions in the reference configuration. The incremental theory, given in Stroh form, is used to derive an exact bifurcation condition. The critical stretch and the associated critical buckling mode are identified for axisymmetric and asymmetric increments in the deformation. Mode transitions are illustrated as the tube slenderness varies. For slender tubes, Euler buckling is energetically favorable, and the effect of residual stress is negligible. However, for short and thick-walled tubes where barreling mode is dominant, the residual stress significantly affects the buckling behavior and may eliminate barreling instability. We show that, depending on its magnitude and direction, residual stress can either accelerate or delay instability. Phase diagrams for various modes are obtained and provide insight into pattern selection across different tube geometries.</p>

            <p>Stabilization of skyrmions in a magnetic material without the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction requires using of an inhomogeneous magnetic field, such as a demagnetization field or an Oersted field. To control and tune the local magnetic field in magnetic material we propose to exploit superconducting nanorings. The field stabilizes the skyrmion through the presence of persistent current induced by the pulses of external field. We analyze the conditions for the stabilization of Neel skyrmion in ferromagnetic layers with out-of-plane anisotropy, as a function of the nanoring size and induced superconducting current. We show that the superconducting current should exceed a critical value for the skyrmion to become stable. The paper presents consistent results from both analytical and micromagnetic calculations for Co and Ga:YIG thin magnetic films.</p>

Using five pump wavelengths between 850 and 1070 nm, the observed spin polarization depends strongly on the pump wavelength with the highest polarization of nearly 5% found for excitation at 980 nm. This corresponds to an effective spin lifetime of 40 ps and is attributed to the dominant excitation of heavy holes only.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Murotani, Tomohiro Fujimoto, Ryusuke Matsunaga</p>
            <p>Photovoltaic Hall effect is an interesting platform of Berry curvature engineering by external fields. Floquet engineering aims at generation of light-induced Berry curvature associated with topological phase transition in solids, which may manifest itself as a light-induced anomalous Hall effect. However, recent studies have pointed out an important role of the bias electric field, which adds a field-induced circular photogalvanic effect to the photovoltaic Hall effect. Except for numerical studies, the two mechanisms have been described by different theoretical frameworks, hindering a coherent understanding. Here, we develop a unified theory of the photovoltaic Hall effect capable of describing both mechanisms on an equal footing. We reveal that the bias electric field alters the interband transition dipole moment, transition energy, and intraband velocity, all contributing to the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect in nonmagnetic materials. The first process can be expressed as a manifestation of the electric field-induced Berry curvature. Shift vector plays an essential role in determining the transition energy shift. We also clearly distinguish the anomalous Hall effect by light-dressed states within the density matrix calculation using the length gauge. Our theory unifies a number of nonlinear optical processes in a physically transparent way and reveals their geometric aspect.</p>

            <p>Magnetic excitations are important quantum phenomena in magnetic systems and have been widely studied in individual magnetic atoms and molecules as well as their assembled structures over the past few decades. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) combined with density functional theory (DFT) and the state-of-the-art ab initio wavefunction calculations, we investigated the properties of a novel dual-core Cr2Br6 molecule, which consists of two Cr ions coupled via superexchange through a single near-90° Cr-Br-Cr scissors bond. Under zero magnetic field, we observed a Fano peak with multi-steps through STS. When an external magnetic field is applied, some steps exhibit additional splitting, while others change little. We find that the Cr2Br6, exhibits a spin-degenerate ground state, and the complex peak splitting arises from the coexistence of vibrational and magnetic excitations in the molecule. Our results reveal rich quantum spin behavior in a well-defined two-core magnetic trihalide complex at the atomic scale, offering not only a minimal model for superexchange-coupled multi-spin quantum excitations but also a possible foundational unit for future molecule-based quantum functionalities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruya Nakagawara, Minoru Kanega, Shunsuke C. Furuya, Masahiro Sato</p>
            <p>Electric-field controls of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) have recently been discussed from the microscopic viewpoint. Since the DMI plays a critical role in generating topological spin textures (TSTs) such as the chiral soliton, the magnetic skyrmion, and the magnetic hedgehog, electric-field controls of these TSTs have become an important issue. This paper shows that such electric-field-induced DMI indeed creates and annihilates TSTs by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for many-body spin systems at finite temperatures. We show that when a strong electric field is applied in a proper way to one- or two-dimensional ferromagnets, the Hamiltonians are changed into the well-known spin models for the chiral soliton or the skyrmion lattice, and the TST states emerge. We utilize a machine-learning method to count the number of generated TSTs. In the three-dimensional (3D) case, we demonstrate the electric-field induction of a magnetic hedgehog structure as follows: Applying a strong enough electric field along a proper direction to a skyrmion-string state (a triple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state) at low but finite temperatures, we find that the field-induced DMI can drive a quadruple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state with hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs. This result indicates that we have succeeded in constructing a simple 3D short-range interacting spin model hosting a magnetic hedgehog structure.</p>

            <h2>Pseudo-Goldstone Modes at Finite Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiyue Lin, Tao Shi</p>
            <p>Goldstone's theorem and its extension to pseudo-Goldstone (PG) modes have profound implications across diverse areas of physics, from quantum chromodynamics to quantum magnetism. PG modes emerge from accidental degeneracies lifted by quantum and thermal fluctuations, leading to a finite gap--a phenomenon known as "order by disorder." In this paper, we derive a general curvature formula for the PG gap at finite temperature, applicable to both collinear (e.g., ferromagnets and anti-ferromagnets) and noncollinear magnetic orders (e.g., coplanar orders in frustrated magnetic systems). After validating our formula against known models, we apply it to the XXZ model on the triangular lattice, which hosts coplanar magnetic orders in equilibrium and is relevant to materials such as Na2BaCo(PO4)2 and K2Co(SeO3)2, known for their supersolid phases and giant magnetocaloric effects. Our results reveal a distinct scaling behavior: a linear decrease of the PG gap with temperature, driven by entropy effects from magnon scattering across multiple bands. This stands in stark contrast to the high-temperature scaling recently proposed for systems with a single magnon band. This work establishes a general framework for investigating PG modes at finite temperatures and opens an avenue to explore rich quantum phases and dynamics in frustrated systems with noncollinear magnetic orders.</p>

            <p>The emergence of superconductivity with strong correlation is one of the most attracted issues in condensed-matter physics, as seen in various unconventional superconductors. Here we show a new strongly correlated superconductor Li1-xNbO2 with rich characteristics such as two-dimensional, geometrically frustrated, and triangular NbO2 lattice and correlated flat-band-like electronic states. We revealed the electronic phase diagram by implementing Li-ion electrochemical cells with LiNbO2 epitaxial films. The Li-ion deintercalation increased the hole-doping level in NbO2 layer, along which a band insulator LiNbO2 underwent to a Fermi-liquid (FL) metal and superconductor associated with non-Fermi liquid (NFL) characters. The evolution of the NFL state coincided with the suppression of the Kondo-singlet formation near the superconducting dome, which linked superconductivity with quantum criticality. The obtained phase diagram involves general aspects of strongly correlated superconductors and bridges the gap between various systems.</p>

            <p>The combination of magnetism and topological properties in one material platform is attracting significant attention due to the potential of realizing low power consumption and error-robust electronic devices. Common practice is to start from a topological material with band inversion and incorporates ferromagnetism via chemical doping or magnetic proximity effect (MPE). In this work, we show that a topological material is not necessary and that both ferromagnetism and band inversion can be established simultaneously in a trivial insulating material by MPE from a neighbouring ferromagnetic layer. This novel route is demonstrated using quantum transport measurements and first principles calculations in a heterostructure consisting of 5 nm thick FeOx/1 monolayer of FeAs/ 3 nm thick alpha Sn. The Shubnikov de Haas oscillations show that there is linear band dispersion with high mobility in the heterostructure even though a 3 nm thick alpha Sn single layer is a trivial semiconductor. Furthermore, first principles calculations reveal that band inversion indeed occurs in this heterostructure, suggesting that the observed linear band is a topological surface state within this inverted gap. This work significantly expands the foundation for realizing magnetic topological materials in a myriad of trivial narrow gap semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Interplay between timescales governs the residual activity of a harmonically bound active Brownian particle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanatan Halder, Manas Khan</p>
            <p>Active microparticles in confining potentials manifest complex and intriguing dynamical phenomena, as their activity competes with confinement. The steady-state position distributions of harmonically bound active Brownian particles (HBABPs) exhibit a crossover from Boltzmann-like to bimodal, commonly recognized as passive to active transition, upon variation of the activity and the confinement strength. By studying optically trapped phoretically active Janus colloids, along with simulations and analytical calculations of HBABPs, we provide a comprehensive dynamical description emphasizing the resultant velocity to examine this understanding. Our results establish that the crossover is instead from active to passive-like, and is governed solely by the interplay between the persistence time $\tau_{\rm R}$, and the equilibration time in harmonic potential $\tau_k$. When $\tau_{\rm R} < \tau_k$, despite a Boltzmann-like position distribution, the HBABP retains a substantial resultant or residual active velocity, denoting an activity-dominated regime. In contrast, at $\tau_{\rm R} > \tau_k$, the restoring force fully counterbalances propulsion at a radial distance, where the HBABP exhibits harmonically bound Brownian particle (HBBP)-like dynamics, and the position distribution becomes bimodal. We further provide a quantitative measure of the residual activity, which decreases monotonically with $\tau_{\rm R} / \tau_k$, eventually converging to a nominal value corresponding to HBBP as $\tau_{\rm R} / \tau_k$ exceeds 1, corroborating our conclusions.</p>

            <p>Modern density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations rely heavily on pseudopotentials, yet their impact on accuracy is barely addressed. In this work, we derive from the Kohn-Sham equation that the use of pseudopotentials invariably introduces a ``dropping" error, which leads to a deviation from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Crossed pseudopotential-functional calculations provide a pragmatic way to balance accuracy and efficiency, enabling the right results for the right reasons. This paradigm goes beyond the (generalized) Kohn-Sham framework, which we name the extended Kohn-Sham framework. We support our assertion with a bandgap study on 54 monovalent-Cu semiconductors. The crossed calculations, compared to consistent ones, not only remove all 11 erroneous metal predictions, but also drastically reduce the mean relative error from 80\% to 20\%. The accuracy even exceeds that of the hybrid functionals and GW due to the role of pseudopotentials in modelling the external potentials of Cu-valence electrons that cannot be compensated by exchange-correlation.</p>

            <p>We investigated nonlinear conduction in bulk single crystals of VO2 with precise temperature control. Two distinct nonequilibrium phenomena were identified: a gradual reduction of the charge gap and a current-induced insulator-metal transition. The electric field required to drive the nonlinear conduction is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than that reported for VO2 thin films or nanobeams, strongly indicating an intrinsic electronic origin rather than a temperature increase due to self heating. Notably, our results suggest that the application of a steady current to the frozen insulating state can induce a nonequilibrium steady-state metallic phase -- effectively melting the electronic ice. This highlights a novel route to controlling electronic states via nonthermal, current-driven mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Zirconium nitride (ZrN) is a refractory material with good mechanical and thermal properties. It is therefore a good candidate for hard surface treatment at high temperature. In this work, we report the growth and characterization of ZrN by plasma assisted thermal nitridation of zirconium films in a NH3 atmosphere. The process was monitored by in situ monochromatic ellipsometry and the nitrides grown were profiled and analyzed by Auger electron spectroscopy. By using temperatures in the 700--800___{\textdegree}C range, the material obtained is quite close to ZrN, but, depending on experimental conditions, residual oxygen (impurities) can be easily incorporated by reaction with zirconium. The analysis of the ellipsometric data has shown that the nitridation did not occur by simple growth of nitride on zirconium. Auger profiles confirmed the presence of an oxidized zirconium layer localized between the nitrided surface and the remaining metal. This oxidation was observed to occur preferentially during temperature ramping, that is, in the low temperature regime. At high temperature, nitridation is dominant and the incorporated oxygen is exchanged with nitrogen. Oxygen is then partly rejected by diffusion out of the film through the ZrN surface layer and partly by diffusion in the deep zirconium sublayer. By using these observations, a new model of growth with a layered ZrN/ZrOx/Zr film was used to describe in situ ellipsometric data. By comparing the pure thermal and the plasma treatments, the advantages of the plasma assisted treatment become clearly: complete nitridation of the zirconium layer was achieved and the oxygen amounts in the film were substantially reduced.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study the piezomagnetic effect on the altermagnetic state in $\kappa$-type molecular conductors, focusing on its nonrelativistic mechanism. By introducing shear stress as a monoclinic distortion, we evaluate variations in the effective tight-binding model using first-principles calculations. Using the derived parameters, we investigate the Hubbard model and its effective Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional (distorted) $\kappa$-type lattice within mean-field approximation. We show that the system exhibits the piezomagnetic effect, i.e., a net magnetization induced at finite temperatures in the undoped insulating state and both in the ground state and at finite temperatures upon doping. In a real-space picture, this uniform magnetization arises from the ferrimagnetic spin structure due to inequivalent spin sites induced by lattice distortion. Meanwhile, in a momentum-space picture, it stems from the {\it s}-wave spin splitting of the electron and magnon bands, independent of spin-orbit coupling. We find that this nonrelativistic piezomagnetism remains finite, but becomes smaller in the limit of strong dimerization where the energy gap between the bonding and antibonding orbitals is infinitely large and the {\it d}-wave altermagnetic spin splitting is absent, highlighting the importance of the multi-orbital nature.</p>

            <p>We investigate the long-term relaxation of a distribution of $N$ point vortices in two-dimensional hydrodynamics, in the limit of weak collective amplification. Placing ourselves within the limit of an average axisymmetric distribution, we stress the connections with generic long-range interacting systems, whose relaxation is described within angle-action coordinates. In particular, we emphasise the existence of two regimes of relaxation, depending on whether the system's profile of mean angular velocity (frequency) is a non-monotonic [resp. monotonic] function of radius, which we refer to as profile (1) [resp. profile (2)]. For profile (1), relaxation occurs through two-body non-local resonant couplings, i.e. $1/N$ effects, as described by the inhomogeneous Landau equation. For profile (2), the impossibility of such two-body resonances submits the system to a ``kinetic blocking''. Relaxation is then driven by three-body couplings, i.e. $1/N^{2}$ effects, whose associated kinetic equation has only recently been derived. For both regimes, we compare extensively the kinetic predictions with large ensemble of direct $N$-body simulations. In particular, for profile (1), we explore numerically an effect akin to ``resonance broadening'' close to the extremum of the angular velocity profile. Quantitative description of such subtle nonlinear effects will be the topic of future investigations.</p>

Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p>

            <p>Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has revolutionized high-volume manufacturing of nanoscale components, enabling the production of smaller, denser, and more energy efficient integrated circuit devices. Yet, the use of EUV light results in ionization driven chemistry within the imaging materials of lithography, the photoresists. The complex interplay of ionization, generation of primary and secondary electrons, and the subsequent chemical mechanisms leading to image formation in photoresists has been notoriously difficult to study. In this work, we deploy photoemission spectroscopy with a 92 eV EUV light source combined with first-principles simulations to unravel the chemical changes occurring during exposure in a model chemically amplified photoresist. The results reveal a surprising chemical reaction pathway, namely the EUV-induced breakdown of the photoacid generator (PAG), which is a critical component in the EUV mechanism. This previously unobserved reaction mechanism manifests as changes in intensity of the valence band peaks of the EUV photoemission spectrum, which are linked to degradation of the PAG via an advanced atomistic simulation framework. Our combined experimental and theoretical approach shows that EUV photoemission can simultaneously resolve chemical dynamics and the production of primary and secondary electrons, giving unique insights into the chemical transformation of photoresist materials. Our results pave the way for utilizing accessible, table-top EUV spectroscopy systems for observing EUV photoresist chemical dynamics, with the potential for time-resolved measurements of photoemission processes in the future.</p>

            <p>The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a photoluminescent defect in diamond that exists in different charge states, NV$^-$ and NV$^0$, that are sensitive to the NV's nanoscale environment. Here, we show that photoluminescence (PL) from NV centers in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) can be employed for all-optical voltage sensing based on electric field-induced NV charge state modulation. More than 95% of FNDs integrated into a capacitor device show a transient increase in NV$^-$ PL intensity of up to 31% within 0.1 ms after application of an external voltage, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in NV$^0$ PL. The change in NV$^-$ PL increases with increasing applied voltage from 0 to 100 V, corresponding to an electric field of 0 to 625 kV cm$^ {-1}$ in our devices. The electric field sensitivity of a single FND is 19 V cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^ {-1/2}$. We investigate the NV charge state photodynamics on the millisecond timescale and find that the change in NV PL strongly depends on the rate of photoexcitation. We propose a model that qualitatively explains the observed changes in NV PL based on an electric field-induced redistribution of photoexcited electrons from substitutional nitrogen defects to NV centers, leading to a transient conversion of NV$^0$ to NV$^-$ centers upon application of an external voltage. Our results contribute to the development of FNDs as reliable, all-optical, nanoscale electric field sensors in solid-state systems.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Bauschinger Effect in Active Ultrastable Glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rashmi Priya, Smarajit Karmakar</p>
            <p>Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.</p>

            <h2>Charge transfer between van der Waals coupled metallic 2D layers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bharti Matta, Philipp Rosenzweig, Craig Polley, Ulrich Starke, Kathrin Küster</p>
            <p>Van der Waals heterostructures have become a rapidly growing field in condensed matter research, offering a platform to engineer novel quantum systems by stacking different two-dimensional (2D) materials. A diverse range of material combinations, including hexagonal boron nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene, with electronic properties spanning from insulating to semiconducting, metallic, and semimetallic, have been explored to tune the properties of these heterostacks. However, understanding the interactions and charge transfer between the stacked layers remains challenging, particularly when more than two layers are involved. In this study, we investigate the charge transfer in a potassium-adlayer/graphene/lead-monolayer heterostructure stacked on a SiC substrate. Using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we analyze the band structure of each layer, focusing on the charge transfer from K to the underlying 2D layers. Since K forms a $(2 \times 2)$ overlayer with respect to graphene, the amount of charge carriers donated by K can be determined. Our findings reveal that adsorption of K not only leads to a significant $n$-doping of the adjacent graphene layer but also to an electron transfer into the Pb monolayer. Remarkably, $\approx 44\%$ of the electrons donated by the K adlayer are transferred into its second nearest neighbouring layer, i.e. Pb, while $\approx 56\%$ remain in the graphene.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harrison LaBollita, Antia S. Botana</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity under pressure in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has attracted a great deal of attention. Here, using density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we study the correlated electronic structure of the latest superconducting member of the family: the alternating single-layer bilayer nickelate La$_{5}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{11}$. Due to its alternating single-layer and bilayer structural motif, this hybrid RP nickelate exhibits layer-selective physics with the single-layer neighboring a Mott instability, rendering the bilayer the dominant contributor to its low-energy physics, both at ambient and high pressure. The electronic structure of La$_{5}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{11}$ ultimately resembles that of the bilayer compound La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$, pointing to the presence of universal features in the family of superconducting RP nickelates. Thus, La$_{5}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{11}$ provides a new platform to disentangle the key degrees of freedom underlying superconductivity in pressurized RP nickelates, underscoring the central role of the bilayer structural motif.</p>

            <p>The extent to which non-reciprocal waves can be guided in arbitrary directions is an interesting question. We address one aspect of this problem by studying the propagation of acoustic spin waves in a narrow physical conduit made of a synthetic antiferromagnet. Through a combination of Brillouin Light Scattering microscopy and modeling, we demonstrate that even when attempting to guide waves in the reciprocal direction of the material, the system still exhibits strong signatures of non-reciprocity. This includes the excitation of high wavevector waves in the direction perpendicular to the intended channeling, as well as energy transfer in directions that often neither aligns with the physical conduit nor with the symmetry axes of the magnetic properties. These findings have implications for the modeling of propagating wave spectroscopy in non-reciprocal materials and their potential applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacky Even, Simon Thebaud, Aseem Kshirsagar, Laurent Pedesseau, Marios Zacharias, Claudine Katan</p>
            <p>Short abstract: The paper reviews the physics of Frohlich excitonic polarons from the viewpoint of empirical approaches with some original developments. Models for excitonic polarons in ionic semiconductors in the spirit of the Lee Low and Pines (LLP) model for free polarons were initiated by Toyozawa and Hermanson and extended by Pollman and Buttner (PB). The dominant electron-hole interaction with the lattice introduced by Frohlich is represented by a long-range effective interaction with a single longitudinal optical polar mode. The properties of the excitonic polarons are characterized by various physical quantities such as effective dielectric constants, effective masses, virtual phonon populations, carrier self-energies and binding energies, and effective electron-hole interactions mediated by the lattice. In 3D perovskites, the excitonic polarons deviate from the simplified picture of weakly interacting (almost free) polarons, with sizeable effects of electron-hole correlations on all the physical properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guanping Xu, Zirui Zhao, Zhonglin Wang, Hai-feng Li</p>
            <p>The integration of machine learning techniques with triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) offers a transformative pathway for optimizing energy harvesting technologies. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that utilizes graph neural networks to predict and enhance the performance of TENG electrode materials and doping strategies. By leveraging an extensive dataset of experimental and computational results, the model effectively classifies electrode materials, predicts optimal doping ratios, and establishes robust structure-property relationships. Key findings include a 65.7\% increase in energy density for aluminum-doped PTFE and an 85.7\% improvement for fluorine-doped PTFE, highlighting the critical influence of doping materials and their concentrations. The model further identifies PTFE as a highly effective negative electrode material, achieving a maximum energy density of 1.12~J/cm$^2$ with 7\% silver (Ag) doping when copper (Cu) is used as the positive electrode. This data-driven approach not only accelerates material discovery but also significantly reduces experimental costs, providing novel insights into the fundamental factors influencing TENG performance. The proposed methodology establishes a robust platform for intelligent material design, advancing the development of sustainable energy technologies and self-powered systems.</p>

            <h2>Morphology and Strain Engineering of Cu-based Materials by Chemical Dealloying for Electrochemical CO Reduction</h2>

            <p>Nanoporous Cu (NPC), synthesized by chemical dealloying of brass, holds significant potential for catalysis of electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction, owing to the optimal binding energy of Cu with *CO and *H intermediates, and the abundance of surface under-coordinated atoms inherent to the nanoporous structure. However, further optimization of NPC morphology and chemistry for CO reduction can only be made possible by understanding the dealloying process. Hence overcoming challenges concerning the direct measurement of atomic scale chemistry and under-coordinated atoms in NPC nano-ligaments is vital. In this study, NPC with tunable ligament sizes between nanometer and micrometer range were synthesized by varying the temperature of Cu20Zn80 (atomic ratio) chemical dealloying in concentrated phosphoric acid. The evolution of chemistry and structure of nano-ligaments during dealloying were probed for the first time using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and cryo-atom probe tomography (APT) revealing the phase transformations and complex chemistry in nano-ligaments. A method based on the asymmetricity of synchrotron XRD peaks of NPC samples was also proposed to estimate the quantity of under-coordinated atoms on nano-ligaments, as ligament surface strain. Finally, CO reduction using electrochemistry mass spectrometry (EC-MS) demonstrated the promising performance of NPC compared to polycrystalline Cu. An optimal ligament surface strain value was also observed for the CO reduction on NPC, which provides more mechanistic insights into the complicated CO reduction process and an alternative strategy for Cu-based catalysts engineering. This work also shows how the application of synchrotron X-ray diffraction and EC-MS facilitates more efficient and accurate optimization of copper-based catalysts for electrochemical CO reduction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teng Xiao, Tsan Huang, Changhua Bao, Zhiyuan Sun</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) and ultrafast optical experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Jue Zhang, Rong Lü, Qi-Bo Zeng</p>
            <p>We introduce a new type of one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing. We find three physical regimes in this model by tuning the $p$-wave pairing and the chemical potential of the system. In the topologically nontrivial phase, there are two Majorana zero modes localized at the opposite ends of the lattice, which are characterized and protected by nonzero topological invariants. More interestingly, we also find a regime where the system can hold four unprotected nonzero-energy edge modes in the trivial phase, which is analogous to a weak topological phase. The third regime is also trivial but holds no edge modes. The emergence of zero- and nonzero-energy edge modes in the system are analyzed by transforming the lattice model into a ladder consisting of Majorana fermions, where the competition between intra- and inter-leg couplings leads to the rich phase diagram. We further investigate the properties of edge modes under the influences of dissipation, which is represented by introducing a imaginary part in the chemical potential. Our work unveils the exotic properties induced by the staggered $p$-wave pairing and provides a new platform for further exploration of Majorana edge modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Mal, Subhankar Mishra, Prasenjit Sen</p>
            <p>Crystal structure generation is a foundational challenge in materials discovery, particularly in designing functional inorganic crystalline materials with desired properties. Most existing diffusion-based generative models for crystals rely on complex, hand-crafted priors and modular architectures to separately model atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters. These methods often require customized diffusion processes and conditional denoising, which can introduce additional model complexities and inconsistencies. Here we introduce DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that jointly learns the distribution of all structural components in crystalline materials. With crystal structure representation as unified 2D matrices, DiffCrysGen bypasses the need for task-specific priors or decoupled modules, enabling end-to-end generation of atom types, fractional coordinates, and lattice parameters within a single framework. Our model learns crystallographic symmetry and chemical validity directly from large-scale datasets, allowing it to scale to complex materials discovery tasks. As a demonstration, we applied DiffCrysGen to the design of rare-earth-free magnetic materials with high saturation magnetization, showing its effectiveness in generating stable, diverse, and property-aligned candidates for sustainable magnet applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joeri Opdam, Michio Tateno, Hajime Tanaka</p>
            <p>Competing interactions stabilize exotic mesoscopic structures, yet the microscopic mechanisms by which they influence non-equilibrium processes leading to disordered states remain largely unexplored, despite their critical role in self-assembly across a range of nanomaterials and biological systems. Here, we numerically investigate the structural evolution in charged colloidal model systems, where short-range attractions and long-range repulsions compete. We reveal that these two interaction scales drive sequential ordering within clusters, from tetrahedra motifs to linear aggregates with chiral order. This process disrupts early-stage percolated networks, resulting in reentrant behavior -- a dynamic transition from disordered cluster to network to chiral rigid cluster. On the other hand, the cluster-elastic network boundary in the final state is governed by isostatic percolation, which slows structural rearrangements, preserves branching points, and sustains a long-lived network. The resulting structure consist of rigid Bernal spiral-like branches connected through flexible branching points lacking order. These insights advance our microscopic understanding of out-of-equilibrium ordering driven by competing interactions, particularly phenomena like temporally delayed frustration reflecting different length scales of competing interactions. The mechanisms identified here may play a crucial role in mesoscale self-organization across soft materials, from nanoparticle assemblies to biological gels and cytoskeletal networks. Understanding how competing interactions regulate structure and dynamics could guide the design of adaptive materials with tunable mechanical properties and offer new perspectives on biological processes such as cytoplasmic organization and cellular scaffolding.</p>

            <p>Single crystals are essential for characterizing a wide range of magnetic states, including exotic ones such as quantum spin liquids. This study reports a flux method for growing single crystals of NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, the first quantum spin liquid candidate on a triangular spin lattice with dominant Ising like spin correlations. Purple NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ single crystals with hexagonal morphology were successfully grown using a K$_2$Mo$_3$O$_{10}$-B$_2$O$_3$ flux. With lateral sizes up to 3.5 mm and a thickness up to 2 mm, these are the largest dimensions reported to date. The chemical composition was confirmed by powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction along with scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Aiming for an accurate determination of the magnetic anisotropy and its effect on the magnetic properties, NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ crystals were additionally analyzed by magnetic susceptibility, revealing a substantial anisotropy without long-range magnetic ordering down to 2 K. Single crystals of two novel rare-earth heptatantalates, ErTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and GdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, were also grown and their magnetic properties investigated. The magnetic anisotropy of ErTa$_7$O$_{19}$ closely resembles that of isostructural NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, indicating a possibility of a similar exotic magnetic ground state. In contrast, GdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ shows paramagnetic behavior, consistent with previous results obtained for polycrystalline samples.</p>

Here we derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian describing the band structure of the HgTe nanowire close to the fundamental band gap. Because both the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands have quadratic dependence on $k_{z}$ when the gap closes, we need to consider at least three subbands, i.e., the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands, in building the effective Hamiltonian. The resulted effective Hamiltonian is block diagonal and each block is a $3\times3$ matrix. End states are found in the inverted regime when we solve the effective Hamiltonian with open boundary condition.</p>

            <p>Noncollinear antiferromagnets offer much promise for antiferromagnetic spintronics and neuromorphic applications with a plethora of functional properties surpassing many competing magnetic systems. Films grown on mismatched substrates can relieve strain by the creation of slip-plane defects - and recently we have shown that these defects can manipulate global physical properties important for application. Here we demonstrate that post growth annealing results in near-defect-free, structurally robust films that allow the magnetic order thermal evolution to change as a function of film thickness. Strong spin-lattice coupling ensures that substrate clamping limits the ability of thinner films to transform as they are cooled to low temperature. However, beyond a certain thickness, films no longer suffer this constraint, revealing the extraordinary transformations that provide the pathway for spin to reach the lowest energy state. We show that this transition cannot be explained by the previously established mechanism of spin rotations in the (111) plane, and we calculate that rotations along the chirality-inverting [1-10] direction may be preferable under certain conditions. Our work suggests that chirality inverting rotations in these materials may have been previously overlooked in studies adopting the so-called octupole approximation of the net magnetic moment. This enriches the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics, raising the possibility of device designs with thickness engineered to exploit switching of chirality.</p>

            <p>Topological magnetic structures, such as Hopfions, are central to three-dimensional magnetism, but their characterization in complex geometries remains challenging. We introduce a robust finite-element method for calculating the Hopf index in micromagnetic simulations of three-dimensional nanostructures. By employing the Biot-Savart form for the vector potential, our approach ensures gauge-invariant results, even in multiply connected geometries like tori. A novel variance-based correction scheme significantly reduces numerical errors in highly inhomogeneous textures, achieving accurate Hopf index values with fast mesh-dependent convergence. We validate the method using an analytically defined Hopfion structure and demonstrate its ability to detect topological transitions through a simulation of a Hopfion's field-induced destruction into a toron, marked by an abrupt change in the Hopf index. This method enables precise quantification of topological features in complex three-dimensional magnetic textures forming in finite-element micromagnetic simulations, offering a powerful tool for advancing topological magnetism studies in general geometries.</p>

            <p>The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</p>

            <p>Mesoscopic Coulomb blockade (MCB) is recognized as a phase-coherent variant of the conventional Coulomb blockade that arises in systems with open contacts. In open quantum dots, MCB is enhanced by a decrease in background conductance. This occurs because the reduction in coupling strength between the quantum dot and the outer reservoir renders the system more closed, thereby facilitating the emergence of conventional Coulomb blockade. In this work, we demonstrate that the MCB in open superconducting islands exhibits an different correlation with coupling strength compared to open quantum dots. Specifically, a decrease in background conductance may result in a weakening of the MCB. This observation indicates that the MCB in superconducting islands originates from the presence of superconducting-normal interfaces.</p>

            <p>We conduct a theoretical investigation into explosive growth of bistability in a cavity magnonic system incorporating magnetic nonlinearity. In this system, the coupling between the magnon and photon generates the cavity magnon polaritons. When driving the photon-like polariton mode, the bistability can undergo a sudden transition with the increase of the driving power, resulting in an explosive growth of the bistable region by several times. Conversely, driving the magnon-like polariton mode only gives rise to normal bistability. This depends on whether the minimum driving power required to generate the bistability is non-monotonic with respect to the driving frequency. In addition, despite driving only the photon-like polariton mode, the photon- and magnon-like polariton modes can show simultaneous explosive growth of the bistability in microwave transmission, owing to the light-matter interaction. Our research sheds light on the hidden side of the nonlinear cavity magnonic system and provides a potential application for cavity spintronic devices founded on this novel feature.</p>

            <p>Thermal transport in nanoscale interconnects is dominated by intricate electron-phonon interactions and microstructural influences. As copper faces limitations at the nanoscale, tungsten and ruthenium have emerged as promising alternatives due to their substantial phonon contributions to thermal conductivity. Metals with stronger phonon-mediated thermal transport are particularly advantageous in nanoscale architectures, where phonons are less sensitive to size effects than electrons. Here, we show that phonons play a comparable role to electrons in the thermal transport of ruthenium and tungsten thin films, evidenced by deviations from the classical Wiedemann-Franz law. Elevated Lorenz numbers-1.9 and 2.7 times the Sommerfeld value for ruthenium and tungsten, respectively-indicate phonon contributions of 45% and 62% to total thermal conductivity. Comparisons of in-plane thermal conductivity from steady-state thermoreflectance and electron relaxation times from infrared ellipsometry reveal that phonon-mediated transport is insensitive to microstructural variations and scaling. Ultrafast infrared pump-probe measurements show that ruthenium exhibits a higher electron-phonon coupling factor than tungsten, consistent with the differing contributions of carriers to thermal transport. Molecular dynamics simulations and spectral energy density analysis confirm substantial phonon-driven thermal transport and mode-dependent phonon lifetimes. These results offer insights into phonon-driven thermal transport and provide design principles for selecting interconnects with enhanced thermal management.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João Paulo C Moura, Vanessa S Antonin, Aline B Trench, Mauro C Santos</p>
            <p>The electrochemical performances of the {\alpha}-MnO2/Vulcan XC-72 and {\delta}-MnO2/Vulcan XC-72 nanostructures in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis were compared herein. Both materials were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route. Their structures and morphologies were analyzed by SEM, HRTEM, XPS, Raman Scattering and XRD, and their ORR electrochemical properties and H2O2 electrosynthesis efficacies were investigated in alkaline NaOH solutions applying the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. Gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setups in acid media aiming at H2O2 formation were also performed. The 3% {\delta}-MnO2/C and 1% {\alpha}-MnO2/C electrocatalysts were more efficient and selective than pure Vulcan XC-72 through the ORR 2-electron pathway in the RRDE essays. Concerning H2O2 electrogeneration using GDE, the 1% {\alpha}-MnO2/C electrocatalyst displayed better activity, with peroxide accumulation of 402.6 mg/L at -1.9 V (vs Ag/AgCl) after 120 min, 48 % higher than pure Vulcan XC-72 GDE. These results can be ascribed to a synergistic effect between {\alpha}-MnO2 and Vulcan XC-72, as well as oxygen functional acid species improvement, increasing electrocatalytic surface hydrophilicity and enhancing H2O2 electrosynthesis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Krämer, M. Hörmann, K.P. Schmidt</p>
            <p>We study the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice with bond- and site-dilution at zero temperature by stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Tuning the transverse field $h$ and the dilution $p$, the quantum phase diagram of both models is explored. Both quantum phase diagrams show long-range order for small $h$ and small $p$. The ordered phase of each is separated from the disordered (quantum) Griffiths phase by second-order phase transitions on two critical lines touching at a multi-critical point. Using Binder ratios we locate quantum critical points with high accuracy. The order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the average correlation-length exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ are determined along the critical lines and at the multi-critical points for the first time via finite-size scaling. We find three internally consistent sets of critical exponents and compare them with potentially connected universality classes. The quantum Griffiths phase in the vicinity of the phase transition lines is analyzed through the local susceptibility. Our results indicate that activated scaling occurs not only at the percolation transition, but also at the phase transition line for $p$ smaller than the percolation threshold $p_c$.</p>

            <p>Metal oxide resists (MORs) have shown great promise for high resolution patterning in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, with potential for integration into high volume manufacturing. However, MORs have recently been shown to exhibit sensitivity to process conditions and environment, leading to critical dimension (CD) variation. While this variation can be reduced with proper process control, there is little knowledge on how these aspects affect the image formation mechanism. To bridge these knowledge gaps, we deploy a coordinated, fundamentals-focused approach to yield deep insights into MOR exposure and process chemistry. Our results on a model MOR, an n-butyl Sn-Oxo system, reveal how parameters such as exposure dose, post-exposure bake temperature, and atmospheric species influence the image formation mechanism. Our results, and the coordinated approach using correlative spectroscopies, provide a strong foundation for understanding the image formation mechanism in MOR materials with potential to link mechanistic aspects to CD variation.</p>

            <h2>Design Principles for Realizable Discrete Surface Embeddings in Physical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyungeun Kim, Christian D. Santangelo</p>
            <p>The isometric embedding of surfaces in three-dimensional space is fundamental to various physical systems, from elastic sheets to programmable materials. While continuous surfaces typically admit unique solutions under suitable boundary conditions, their discrete counterparts-represented as networks of vertices connected by edges-can exhibit multiple distinct embeddings for identical edge lengths. We present a systematic approach to constructing discrete meshes that yield a controlled number of embeddings. By analyzing the relationship between mesh connectivity and embedding multiplicity through rigidity theory, we develop criteria for designing meshes that minimize solution multiplicity. We demonstrate computational methods based on local matrix operations and trilateration techniques, enabling practical implementation for meshes with approximately a thousand vertices. Our analysis provides both theoretical bounds on the number of possible embeddings based on Bézout's theorem and practical guidelines for mesh construction in physical applications. Through numerical simulations, we show that this approach achieves comparable accuracy to traditional minimization methods while offering computational advantages through sequential computation. Importantly, we demonstrate that in cases where a unique smooth solution exists, local fluctuations in reconstructed shapes derived from the computational grid can serve as indicators of insufficient geometric constraints. This work bridges the gap between discrete and continuous embedding problems, providing insights for applications in 4D printing, mechanical meta-materials, and deployable structures.</p>

            <p>The localization of electrons caused by atomic disorder is a well-known phenomenon. However, what circumstances allow electrons to remain delocalized and retain band-like characteristics even when the crystal structure is completely absent, as found in certain amorphous solids, is less well understood. To probe this phenomenon, we developed a fully first-principles description of the electronic structure and charge transport in amorphous solids by combining a novel representation of the amorphous state with the state-of-the-art many-body (QSGW) electronic structure theory. Using amorphous In2O3 as an example, we demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in reproducing the band-like nature of the conduction electrons as well as their disorder-limited mobility. Our approach reveals the physical origins responsible for the electron delocalization and the survival of the band dispersions despite the absence of long-range order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maksym Prodius, Adith Sai Aramthottil, Jakub Zakrzewski</p>
            <p>Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunnelings decaying according to power-law with the distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for the continuous tuning of dimerization patterns and disorder strength. We identify different distinct ergodicity-breaking regimes within the parameter space constrained by our geometry. Notably, one of these regimes exhibits a unique feature in which non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) properties of the ground state extend to a noticeable fraction of states across the entire spectrum. This interplay between localization and SPT makes the system particularly interesting, as localization should help with stabilization of topological excitations, while SPT states contribute to an additional delocalization. Other regions of parameters correspond to more standard nonergodic dynamics resembling many-body localization.</p>

            <p>The rapid proliferation of wireless networks and connected devices has led to pervasive electromagnetic (EM) energy dissipation into the environment, an underutilized resource for energy harvesting. Here, we demonstrate a pyrite (FeS$_2$)-bismuth telluride (Bi$_2$Te$_3$) heterojunction that enables hybrid electromagnetic-to-thermoelectric energy conversion. Fabricated via a simple cold-press compaction of powders, the heterojunction forms a Schottky interface at FeS$_2$, facilitating efficient RF absorption and localized heating. This heat is harvested by Bi$_2$Te$_3$ through thermoelectric conversion. Under 35~MHz RF irradiation at 1~W input power, the device achieved a local temperature rise of 46~$^\circ$C and a thermal gradient of 5.5~K across the Bi$_2$Te$_3$, resulting in a peak power density of approximately 13~mW/cm$^2$. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate the heat transport behavior and interfacial thermoelectric performance. This work introduces a new class of heterostructures for RF-responsive energy harvesting, offering a scalable route toward self-powered IoT and wireless sensing systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a computational framework for first-principles density matrix transport within the Wigner function formalism to predict transport of quantum-mechanical degrees of freedom such as spin over long time and length scales. This framework facilitates simulation of spin dynamics and transport from first principles, while accounting for electron-phonon scattering at device length scales. We demonstrate this framework to elucidate the impact of various spin-orbit field profiles, such as Rashba and persistent spin helix, on coherent spin transport in several materials. Using graphene under an electric field as an example to illustrate the impact of electron-phonon scattering on incoherent transport, we show how the transport changes with the strength of scattering. We identify three distinct regimes of incoherent spin transport corresponding to the free induction decay, Dyakonov-Perel and Elliott-Yafet regimes of spin relaxation. In particular, we show that the spin diffusion length is insensitive to the strength of scattering within the Dyakonov-Perel regime.</p>

            <p>This study addresses microstructure selection mechanisms in rapid solidification, specifically targeting the transition from cellular/dendritic to planar interface morphologies under conditions relevant to additive manufacturing. We use a phase-field model that quantitatively captures solute trapping, kinetic undercooling, and morphological instabilities across a broad range of growth velocities ($V$) and thermal gradients ($G$), and apply it to a binary Fe-Cr alloy, as a surrogate for 316L stainless steel. By combining high-fidelity phase-field simulations with a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian active learning approach, we efficiently map the microstructure transitions in the multi-dimensional space of composition, growth velocity, and temperature gradient. We compare our PF results to classical theories for rapid solidification. The classical KGT model yields an accurate prediction of the value of $G$ above which the interface is planar for any growth velocity. Microstructures transition from dendrites to cells as the temperature gradient increases close to this value of $G$. We also identify the occurrence of unstable "intermediate" microstructures at the border between dendritic and planar at low $G$, in the absence of banding instability in this Fe-Cr alloy. Our results highlight the capabilities of Bayesian-guided PF approaches in exploring complex microstructural transitions in multidimensional parameters spaces, thereby providing a robust computational tool for designing process parameters to achieve targeted microstructures and properties in rapidly solidified metallic alloys.</p>

            <p>In two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the inter-particle interaction can lead to the formation of a viscous electron fluid and realization of the hydrodynamic regime of electron transport. Here a nonlinear model of the electron hydrodynamic transport is constructed based on the accounting of pair correlations in the electron dynamics. When describing these systems within the framework of classical kinetics, such correlations represent subsequent ``extended'' collisions of the same electrons temporarily joined into pairs. We study their influence on stationary magnetotransport for large-amplitude fluid flows in long samples. Current profiles in the nonlinear regime and the corresponding differential magnetoresistance are calculated. Pair correlations lead to a characteristic nonmonotonic dependence of the differential resistance on magnetic field. We compare our results with experimental data on magnetoresistance of 2D electrons in high-purity GaAs quantum wells; our model can be responsible for a part of the observed features of the differential magnetoresistance.</p>

            <p>Understanding transition metal atoms' intercalation and diffusion behavior in two-dimensional (2D) materials is essential for advancing their potential in spintronics and other emerging technologies. In this study, we used density functional tight binding (DFTB) simulations to investigate the atomic-scale mechanisms of manganese (Mn) intercalation into NbSe$_2$ bilayers. Our results show that Mn prefers intercalated and embedded positions rather than surface adsorption, as cohesive energy calculations indicate enhanced stability in these configurations. Nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations revealed an energy barrier of 0.68 eV for the migration of Mn into the interlayer, comparable to other substrates, suggesting accessible diffusion pathways. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further demonstrated an intercalation concentration-dependent behavior. Mn atoms initially adsorb on the surface and gradually diffuse inward, resulting in an effective intercalation at higher Mn densities before clustering effects emerge. These results provide helpful insights into the diffusion pathways and stability of Mn atoms within NbSe$_2$ bilayers, consistent with experimental observations and offering a deeper understanding of heteroatom intercalation mechanisms in transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p>In this Letter, we study topological flat bands with distinct features that deviate from conventional Landau level behavior. We show that even in the ideal quantum geometry limit, moire flat band systems can exhibit physical phenomena fundamentally different from Landau levels without lattices. In particular, we find new fractional quantum Hall states emerging from multi-band vortexable systems, where multiple exactly flat bands appear at the Fermi energy. While the set of bands as a whole exhibits ideal quantum geometry, individual bands separately lose vortexability, and thus making them very different from a stack of Landau levels. At certain filling fractions, we find fractional states whose Hall conductivity deviates from the filling factor. Through careful numerical and analytical studies, we rule out all known mechanisms--such as fractional quantum Hall crystals or separate filling of trivial and topological bands--as possible explanations. Leveraging the exact solvability of vortexable systems, we use analytic Bloch wavefunctions to uncover the origin of these new fractional states, which arises from the commensurability between the moire unit cell and the magnetic unit cell of an emergent effective magnetic field.</p>

Even when the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the Berry curvature can be mapped onto a $2+1$ dimensional electromagnetic field arising from an artificial spacetime instanton, in sharp contrast to the Hermitian systems where the Berry curvature is equivalent to the static magnetic field of a magnetic monopole in three spatial dimensions. The instanton appearing as a spacetime singularity carries a topological charge that quantizes the jump of magnetic flux of the Berry curvature at the time origin. Our findings are demonstrated in a simple example related to antiferromagnetic magnons.</p>

            <p>Distinct symmetry enriched topological orders often do not have classical distinctions. Motivated by the recent process on the pyrochlore spin ice materials based on the dipole-octupole doublets, we argue that dipolar spin liquid and octupolar spin liquid can be well differentiated through the magnetic charges of the magnetic monopoles in the classical spin ice regime. It is observed and predicted that, the long-range dipole-dipole interaction renders the magnetic monopole of the dipolar spin ice a finite magnetic charge via the dumbbell picture even in the classical regime. For the octupolar spin ice, however, a zero magnetic charge is expected from this mechanism in the classical regime. We expect this smoking-gun observation to resolve the debate on the nature of Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, and more broadly, this work may inspire further experiments and thoughts on the Ce-pyrochlore spin liquids, Nd-pyrochlore antiferromagnets, Er-based spinels, and the distinct properties of the emergent quasiparticles in various symmetry enriched topological phases.</p>

            <p>In the studied crystals of FeSe0.7 Te0.3 , a structural phase transition occurs in two stages. At higher temperatures, the electronic subsystem undergoes a reconstruction, leading to a significant increase in elastoresistance. 77 Se NMR data show an abrupt change in the relaxation rate during this transition. The final transition occurs at a temperature several degrees below and is also accompanied by anomalies in the electronic properties. Thus, in the Fe(Se,Te) series, similarly to the behavior of pure FeSe under pressure, the type of transition changes and intermediate state appear before the structural transition is suppressed. This similarity between the corresponding phase diagrams is explained by the same deformation of the iron coordination environment in Fe(Se,Te) compounds and in FeSe under pressure. Our findings provide new and significant information on the phase diagram of Fe(Se,Te) compounds and in particular suggest the possible existence of a triple point near the quantum critical point.</p>

            <p>Electron ptychography has recently achieved unprecedented resolution, offering valuable insights across diverse material systems, including in three dimensions. However, high-quality ptychographic reconstruction is computationally expensive and time consuming, requiring a significant amount of manually tuning even for experts. Additionally, essential tools for ptychographic analysis are often scattered across multiple software packages, with some advanced features available only in costly commercial software like MATLAB. To address these challenges, we introduce PtyRAD, an open-source software framework offers a comprehensive, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters--such as sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, and mixed probe and object modes--using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation (AD). By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieves up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. In addition, we propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around artifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional (2D) material datasets and vertical heterostructures. Moreover, PtyRAD integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow that streamlines hyperparameter selection. We hope the open-source nature of PtyRAD will foster reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in ptychographic imaging.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Campos Venuti, Jovan Odavić, Alioscia Hamma</p>
            <p>We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.</p>

            <p>The collapse of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) panels has attracted considerable public and academic interest. As detailed experimental data are not yet available and replicating the natural corrosion process requires years or decades, computational modelling is essential to understand under which conditions corrosion remains concealed. The very high porosity of RAAC is widely suspected to be a major contributing factor. However, current corrosion-induced cracking models are known to struggle with capturing the role of concrete porosity. To remedy this critical deficiency, we propose to enrich corrosion-induced cracking modelling with the analytical solution of reactive transport equations governing the precipitation of rust and a porosity-dependent description of diffusivity. With this, the corrosion concealment in RAAC panels is studied computationally for the first time, revealing that RAAC panels can suddenly collapse before any warning of corrosion-induced surface cracking and allowing to map the conditions most likely to result in sudden collapse.</p>

            <p>Simulating generic quantum states and dynamics is practically intractable using classical computers. However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niclas S. Mueller, Eduardo B. Barros, Stephanie Reich</p>
            <p>Ultrastrong light-matter coupling has traditionally been studied in optical cavities, where it occurs when the light-matter coupling strength reaches a significant fraction of the transition frequency. This regime fundamentally alters the ground and excited states of the particle-cavity system, unlocking new ways to control its physics and chemistry. However, achieving ultrastrong coupling in engineered cavities remains a major challenge. Here, we show that ultra- and deep-strong coupling naturally occur in bulk materials without the need for external cavities. By analyzing experimental data from over 70 materials, we demonstrate that phonon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaritons in many solids exhibit ultrastrong coupling, systematically surpassing the coupling strengths achieved in cavity-based systems. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a dipole lattice model based on a generalized Hopfield Hamiltonian, which unifies photon-matter, matter-matter, and photon-photon interactions. The complete overlap between the photonic and collective dipole modes in the lattice enables ultrastrong coupling, leading to excited-state mixing, radiative decay suppression, and potential phase transitions into collective ground states. Applying our model to real materials, we show that it reproduces light-matter coupling across broad material classes and may underlie structural phase transitions that give rise to emergent phenomena such as ferroelectricity, insulator-to-metal transitions, and exciton condensation. Recognizing ultrastrong coupling as an intrinsic property of solids reshapes our understanding of light-matter interactions and opens new avenues for exploring quantum materials and exotic phases of matter.</p>

            <p>The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria demands development of novel and effective antimicrobial agents. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs), characterized by their unique star-shaped architecture and potent multivalent interactions, represent a promising solution. This study leverages molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of lipidation on SNAPPs' structural stability, membrane interactions, and antibacterial efficacy. We show that lipidation with hexanoic acid (C6), lauric acid (C12), and stearic acid (C18) enhances the {\alpha}-helical stability of SNAPP arms, facilitating deeper insertion into the hydrophobic core of bacterial membranes. Among the variants, C12-SNAPP exhibits the most significant bilayer disruption, followed by C6-SNAPP, whereas the excessive hydrophobicity of C18-SNAPP leads to pronounced arm back-folding towards the core, reducing its effective interaction with the bilayer and limiting its bactericidal performance. Additionally, potential of mean force (PMF) analysis reveals that lipidation reduces the free energy barrier for translocation through the bilipid membrane compared to non-lipidated SNAPPs. These findings underscore the critical role of lipidation in optimizing SNAPPs for combating MDR pathogens.

            <p>Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a sophisticated tool for cost-efficient atomistic simulations approaching DFT accuracy, with recent message passing MLFFs able to cover the entire periodic table. We present an invariant message passing MLFF architecture (MPNICE) which iteratively predicts atomic partial charges, including long-range interactions, enabling the prediction of charge-dependent properties while achieving 5-20x faster inference versus models with comparable accuracy. We train direct and delta-learned MPNICE models for organic systems, and benchmark against experimental properties of liquid and solid systems. We also benchmark the energetics of finite systems, contributing a new set of torsion scans with charged species and a new set of DLPNO-CCSD(T) references for the TorsionNet500 benchmark. We additionally train and benchmark MPNICE models for bulk inorganic crystals, focusing on structural ranking and mechanical properties. Finally, we explore multi-task models for both inorganic and organic systems, which exhibit slightly decreased performance on domain-specific tasks but surprising generalization, stably predicting the gas phase structure of $\simeq500$ Pt/Ir organometallic complexes despite never training to organometallic complexes of any kind.</p>

            <p>Terahertz (THz) technology, a cornerstone of next-generation high-speed communication and sensing, has long been hindered by impedance mismatch challenges that limit device performance and applicability. These challenges become particularly pronounced when ultrasensitive two-dimensional (2D) materials are employed as the device substrate in the THz range, further complicating their integration into real-world applications. Furthermore, conventional antenna designs often fail to provide adequate matching across the extensive THz spectrum. In this work, we tackle these challenges using a procedural generation algorithm to design THz broadband antennas that satisfy specific performance criteria. Namely, the developed inverse design methodology enables customization for the target impedance value, bandwidth, and contact topology requirements. The proposed antenna achieves an improvement of up to 40\% in power transfer efficiency compared to traditional bow-tie antennas under realistic operating conditions. High-fidelity electromagnetic simulations validate these results, confirming the design's practicality for THz applications. This work addresses critical limitations of existing antenna designs and advances the feasibility of high-frequency applications in both communication and sensing.</p>

            <h2>Interpretable SHAP-bounded Bayesian Optimization for Underwater Acoustic Metamaterial Coating Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hansani Weeratunge, Dominic Robe, Elnaz Hajizadeh</p>
            <p>We developed an interpretability informed Bayesian optimization framework to optimize underwater acoustic coatings based on polyurethane elastomers with embedded metamaterial features. A data driven model was employed to analyze the relationship between acoustic performance, specifically sound absorption and the corresponding design variables. By leveraging SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a machine learning interpretability tool, we identified the key parameters influencing the objective function and gained insights into how these parameters affect sound absorption. The insights derived from the SHAP analysis were subsequently used to automatically refine the bounds of the optimization problem automatically, enabling a more targeted and efficient exploration of the design space. The proposed approach was applied to two polyurethane materials with distinct hardness levels, resulting in improved optimal solutions compared to those obtained without SHAP-informed guidance. Notably, these enhancements were achieved without increasing the number of simulation iterations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SHAP to streamline optimization processes by uncovering hidden parameter relationships and guiding the search toward promising regions of the design space. This work underscores the effectiveness of combining interpretability techniques with Bayesian optimization for the efficient and cost-effective design of underwater acoustic metamaterials under strict computational constraints and can be generalized towards other materials and engineering optimization problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yin Huang, Wenna Zhang, Yu Zhou, Yuecheng Shen, Georgios Veronis, Wenchen Luo</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is an intriguing phenomenon in which an extensive number of bulk eigenstates localize at the boundaries of a non-Hermitian system with non-reciprocal hoppings. Here we study the interplay of this effect and a defect in non-reciprocal one-dimensional lattices. We show that the interplay of the NHSE and defects is size-dependent. We demonstrate a novel class of hybrid skin-defect states in finite-size systems resulting from the coupling between the skin and defect states. Next, we consider a single defect in a topologically nontrivial lattice with time-reversal symmetry based on the non-reciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger configuration. We unveil how topologically nontrivial defect states and non-Hermiticity interplay by competing with each other, exhibiting a transition from topologically nontrivial defect states to skin states. In addition, we show that decreasing the defect strength can result in a transition from trivial defect states to skin states. Our work promotes the understanding of the interplay between defects and the NHSE, and especially the importance of the energy spectra of the system with the defect under periodic boundary conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoichiro Tsutsui, Yuhma Asano, Yuta Ito, Hideo Matsufuru, Yusuke Namekawa, Jun Nishimura, Shinji Shimasaki, Asato Tsuchiya</p>
            <p>In our previous paper [JHEP 10 (2020) 144], we found that the complex Langevin (CL) method works for QCD at finite density on the $16^3 \times 32$ lattice in the low-temperature high-density regime within the range $\mu / T = 1.6 - 9.6$ with $\mu$ and $T$ being the quark chemical potential and the temperature, which enabled us to see a clear trend towards the formation of the Fermi sphere. Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term. The spatial extent is $L = (1.3 - 2.7 {\rm ~fm} )> \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1} \sim 1{\rm ~fm}$, in contrast to our previous study with $L < \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1}$. We find that the CL method works in a broad region up to $\mu / T = 4.8$, while it starts to fail as we approach the phase boundary due to the singular drift problem, which can be understood qualitatively by extending the Banks-Casher relation to the case at finite density.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Basanta Mistri, Saksham Mahajan, Felix Donaldson, Rama K. Kamineni, Siddharth Dhomkar</p>
            <p>The negatively charged boron vacancy center in 2D hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising quantum sensor. However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions. These findings and the developed methodology offer valuable insights for mitigating decoherence in a low-field regime.</p>

            <h2>Geometry of Learning -- L2 Phase Transitions in Deep and Shallow Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ibrahim Talha Ersoy, Karoline Wiesner</p>
            <p>When neural networks (NNs) are subject to L2 regularization, increasing the regularization strength beyond a certain threshold pushes the model into an under-parameterization regime. This transition manifests as a first-order phase transition in single-hidden-layer NNs and a second-order phase transition in NNs with two or more hidden layers. This paper establishes a unified framework for such transitions by integrating the Ricci curvature of the loss landscape with regularizer-driven deep learning. First, we show that a curvature change-point separates the model-accuracy regimes in the onset of learning and that it is identical to the critical point of the phase transition driven by regularization. Second, we show that for more complex data sets additional phase transitions exist between model accuracies, and that they are again identical to curvature change points in the error landscape. Third, by studying the MNIST data set using a Variational Autoencoder, we demonstrate that the curvature change points identify phase transitions in model accuracy outside the L2 setting. Our framework also offers practical insights for optimizing model performance across various architectures and datasets. By linking geometric features of the error landscape to observable phase transitions, our work paves the way for more informed regularization strategies and potentially new methods for probing the intrinsic structure of neural networks beyond the L2 context.</p>

            <p>While it is well established that self-propelled particles with alignment interactions can exhibit orientational order, the impact of self-replication and annihilation, which are key characteristics in cellular systems, on spatiotemporal order remains poorly understood. To explore the interplay between self-propulsion and self-replication, we introduce the active Brownian bug (ABB) model, in which self-propelled agents undergo stochastic, density-dependent replication and constant-rate death. Despite the absence of alignment interactions, the system exhibits flocking behavior characterized by high orientational order, while maintaining ordered hexagonal arrays. This emergent order arises from stochastic birth and death processes, offering a novel mechanism for flocking in proliferating cellular populations.</p>

            <p>In this work, quantum gravity effects, which can potentially be measured in magnetometers through the Larmor frequency of atoms in an external magnetic field, are estimated. It is shown that the thermal motion of atoms can, in principle, produce measurable quantum gravity effects, given the precision of modern magnetometers. If the particle velocities are caused by some other mechanism, such as convection, it is shown that the quantum gravity effects may be observed with the magnetometer's proposed detection threshold.

            <h2>Surface tension estimation of bubble nuclei in magma using spinodal pressure and nonclassical nucleation theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mizuki Nishiwaki</p>
            <p>Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct estimation of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density (BND) from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental BND values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Cagnetta, Hyunmo Kang, Matthieu Wyart</p>
            <p>Recent theories suggest that Neural Scaling Laws arise whenever the task is linearly decomposed into power-law distributed units. Alternatively, scaling laws also emerge when data exhibit a hierarchically compositional structure, as is thought to occur in language and images. To unify these views, we consider classification and next-token prediction tasks based on probabilistic context-free grammars -- probabilistic models that generate data via a hierarchy of production rules. For classification, we show that having power-law distributed production rules results in a power-law learning curve with an exponent depending on the rules' distribution and a large multiplicative constant that depends on the hierarchical structure. By contrast, for next-token prediction, the distribution of production rules controls the local details of the learning curve, but not the exponent describing the large-scale behaviour.</p>

            <p>How do neural language models acquire a language's structure when trained for next-token prediction? We address this question by deriving theoretical scaling laws for neural network performance on synthetic datasets generated by the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM) -- an ensemble of probabilistic context-free grammars designed to capture the hierarchical structure of natural language while remaining analytically tractable. Previously, we developed a theory of representation learning based on data correlations that explains how deep learning models capture the hierarchical structure of the data sequentially, one layer at a time. Here, we extend our theoretical framework to account for architectural differences. In particular, we predict and empirically validate that convolutional networks, whose structure aligns with that of the generative process through locality and weight sharing, enjoy a faster scaling of performance compared to transformer models, which rely on global self-attention mechanisms. This finding clarifies the architectural biases underlying neural scaling laws and highlights how representation learning is shaped by the interaction between model architecture and the statistical properties of data.</p>

            <p>Self-diffraction is a non-collinear four-wave mixing technique well-known in optics. We explore self-diffraction in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range, taking advantage of intense femtosecond EUV pulses produced by a free electron laser. Two pulses are crossed in a thin cobalt film and their interference results in a spatially periodic electronic excitation. The diffraction of one of the same pulses by the associated refractive index modulation is measured as a function of the EUV wavelength. A sharp peak in the self-diffraction efficiency is observed at the M$_{2,3}$ absorption edge of cobalt at 59 eV and a fine structure is found above the edge. The results are compared with a theoretical model assuming that the excitation results in an increase of the electronic temperature. EUV self-diffraction offers a potentially useful spectroscopy tool and will be instrumental in studying coherent effects in the EUV range.</p>

We map statistical, algorithmic, and dynamical measures into this conceptual space, discussing their computational accessibility and approximability. This taxonomy reveals the deep challenges posed by uncomputability and highlights the emergence of modern data-driven methods (including autoencoders, latent dynamical models, symbolic regression, and physics-informed neural networks) as pragmatic approximations to classical complexity ideals. Latent spaces emerge as operational arenas where regularity extraction, noise management, and structured compression converge, bridging theoretical foundations with practical modeling in high-dimensional systems. We close by outlining implications for physics-informed AI and AI-guided discovery in complex physical systems, arguing that classical questions of complexity remain central to next-generation scientific modeling.</p>

            <p>Surface defects in colloidal quantum dots are a major source of nonradiative losses, yet the microscopic mechanisms underlying exciton trapping and recombination remain elusive. Here, we develop a model Hamiltonian based on atomistic electronic calculations to investigate exciton dynamics in CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs containing a single hole trap introduced by an unpassivated sulfur atom. By systematically varying the defect depth and reorganization energy, we uncover how defect-induced excitonic states mediate energy relaxation pathways. Our simulations reveal that a single localized defect can induce a rich spectrum of excitonic states, leading to multiple dynamical regimes, from slow, energetically off-resonant trapping to fast, cascaded relaxation through in-gap defect states. Crucially, we quantify how defect-induced polaron shifts and exciton-phonon couplings govern the balance between efficient radiative emission and rapid nonradiative decay. These insights clarify the microscopic origin of defect-assisted loss channels and suggest pathways for tailoring QD optoelectronic properties via surface and defect engineering.</p>

            <p>In this work, we report an alcohol-induced surface charging route of colloidal QDs to achieve controllable electrophoretic deposition processing. By adding a fixed amounts of alcohols into a preformed quantum dots solution in non-polar solvents, the colloidal quantum dots can be positively charged, and then deposited on negative electrode under applied electric field. The surface charging of PbSe quantum dots was investigated by zeta potential, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and discrete Fourier transform calculations. It was found that the zeta potential of oleate acid capped PbSe QDs increases from +1.6 mV to +13.4 mV with the amount of alcohol solvent increasing. The alcohol-induced zeta potential increasing can be explained to the electron cloud shift of active hydrogen mediated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds between carboxy acid and alcohol. Considering the influence of surface charging of quantum dots on their dispersibility, we describe the microscopic mechanism of alcohol-induced electrophoretic deposition processing. Furthermore, we developed a size-selective separation protocol by controlling alcohol-induced electrophoretic deposition processing.</p>

            <p>The random-phase approximation (RPA) formulated within the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation framework is a powerful approach to compute the ground-state energies and properties of molecules and materials. Its overall underbinding behavior can be effectively mitigated by a simple correction term, called renormalized single excitation (rSE) correction. Analytical gradient calculations of the RPA energy have become increasingly available, enabling structural relaxations and even molecular dynamics at the RPA level. However, such calculations at the RPA+rSE level have not been reported, due to the lack of the rSE analytical gradient. Here, we present the first formulation and implementation of the analytical gradients of the rSE energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates within an atomic-orbital basis set framework, which allows us to assess the performance of RPA+rSE in determining the molecular geometries and energetics. It is found that the slight overestimation behavior of RPA for small covalently bonded molecules is strengthened by rSE, while such behavior for molecules bonded with purely dispersion interactions is corrected. We further applied the approach to the water clusters, and found that the energy difference between the low-energy isomers of water hexamers is almost unchanged when going from RPA to RPA+rSE geometries. For the bigger WATER27 test set, using the RPA+rSE geometries instead of the RPA ones leads to a slight reduction of the mean absolute error of RPA+rSE from 0.91 kcal/mol to 0.70 kcal/mol, at the complete basis set.</p>

            <p>We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom imaging fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition.

Lightweight auxetic metastructures (AMSs) provide attractive solutions to this problem. AMSs' negative Poisson's ratio is a unique characteristic which results in very interesting practical properties such as high energy absorption and improved toughness. Different properties of metastrcutures, including anisotropy, are dependent, in addition to their original material, on the unit cell shape and geometrical features which have very high variations. Over the past few years, researchers have developed AMSs with various unit cells, either introducing new internal architecture or enhancing and optimizing the existing ones. Despite the progress made in this field, there is no comprehensive review of the AMS unit cells. This review describes the cellular AMSs associated with a classified set of metastructures, comprising more than 100 distinct auxetic repetitive unit cells. Besides, achievable range of negative Poisson's ratios are provided for different categories of AMSs. Finally, the future perspective of the research field and potential developments and applications in this field are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo-Yi Li, Yu-Ran Zhang</p>
            <p>Prethermal discrete time crystals (PDTCs), an emergent non-equilibrium phase of matter, have been studied in two- and higher-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions and one-dimensional (1D) lattices with long-range interactions. However, different from prethermalization that can be observed in 1D Floquet classical spin systems with NN interactions, classical PDTCs in Floquet 1D systems with only NN interactions have not been proposed before. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of disorder-free PDTCs in 1D Floquet classic spin systems with NN interactions. We show that the thermalization time grows exponentially as the driving frequency increases and depends on the energy density of the initial state, which are two key signatures of PDTCs. The robustness of 1D classical PDTC order is verified by introducing imperfect spin flip operations. The emergence of 1D classical PDTCs can be explained by mapping the 1D classical spin chain with NN interacting to a quantum spin-half system with effective long-range interactions. Our work provides an exploration of quantum characteristics, when considering the classical counterparts of quantum phenomena, and will be helpful for further investigations of both classical and quantum prethermal systems and discrete time-crystalline order.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Machine Learning Potentials for Hydroxide Transport: Surprising Efficiency of Single-Concentration Training</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Hänseroth, Christian Dreßler</p>
            <p>We investigate the transferability of machine learning interatomic potentials across concentration variations in chemically similar systems, using aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions as a case study. Despite containing identical chemical species (K$^+$, OH$^-$, H$_2$O) across all concentrations, models fine-tuned on specific KOH concentrations exhibit surprisingly poor transferability to others, with force prediction errors increasing dramatically from ~30 meV/A (at training concentration) to ~90 meV/A (at very different concentrations). This reveals a critical limitation when applying such models beyond their training domain, even within chemically homogeneous systems. We demonstrate that strategic selection of training data can substantially overcome these limitations without requiring extensive computational resources. Models fine-tuned on intermediate concentrations (6.26 mol/L) exhibit remarkable transferability across the entire concentration spectrum (0.56-17.98 mol/L), often outperforming more computationally expensive models trained on multiple concentration datasets. This approach enables accurate simulation of hydroxide transport dynamics across varying electrolyte conditions while maintaining near-quantum accuracy. Our simulations further reveal the emergence of hydroxide-hydroxide hydrogen bonding at high concentrations - a phenomenon not explicitly represented in dilute training data but successfully captured by our intermediate-concentration model. This work establishes practical guidelines for developing broadly applicable machine learning force fields with optimal transferability, challenging the assumption that diverse training datasets are always necessary for robust performance in similar chemical environments.</p>

            <h2>Second-gradient models for incompressible viscous fluids and associated cylindrical flows</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Balitactac, C. Rodriguez</p>
            <p>We introduce second-gradient models for incompressible viscous fluids, building on the framework introduced by Fried and Gurtin. We propose a new and simple constitutive relation for the hyperpressure to ensure that the models are both physically meaningful and mathematically well-posed. The framework is further extended to incorporate pressure-dependent viscosities. We show that for the pressure-dependent viscosity model, the inclusion of second-gradient effects guarantees the ellipticity of the governing pressure equation, in contrast to previous models rooted in classical continuum mechanics. The constant viscosity model is applied to steady cylindrical flows, where explicit solutions are derived under both strong and weak adherence boundary conditions. In each case, we establish convergence of the velocity profiles to the classical Navier-Stokes solutions as the model's characteristic length scales tend to zero.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joan Elias Miro, Olivier Delouche</p>
            <p>We employ the Fuzzy Sphere regulator to study the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. The model is defined by deforming the Ising model on the Fuzzy Sphere via a purely imaginary longitudinal magnetic field. This model undergoes a quantum phase transition, whose critical point we determine and identify with the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. We show how to tune the model and find that the lowest-lying states of the Hamiltonian align well with the expected CFT spectrum. We discuss the Fuzzy Sphere estimates for the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of the lowest primary operator. Finally, we interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee-Yang CFT. We show that the Fuzzy Sphere calculations are compatible with the best five-loop $\epsilon$-expansion estimates.</p>

            <p>Integrated plasmonics is advancing rapidly, enabling a wide range of functionalities to be incorporated onto a single chip. Applications span information processing, computation, quantum sensing, and dark-matter detection. This progress has driven the development of integrated non-reciprocal devices, which are essential for preventing unwanted feedback that can degrade system performance. While non-reciprocal devices have been realized in edge magnetoplasmon materials via classical interference effects, their operation is often complicated by a dependence on input power. Here, we demonstrate that topological circulators utilizing asymmetric coupling offer improved input power range, isolation, and insertion loss. In this configuration, non-reciprocal behavior arises from the coupling between a chiral edge magnetoplasmonic resonator and LC resonators, leading to non-Hermitian dynamics. The coherent photon-plasmon interaction enables a circulator with up to 50 dB of isolation across a broad range of excitation intensities. This is the first experimental demonstration showing that magnetic topological insulators can support the study of chiral plasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics at radio frequencies, underscoring their potential to enable chip-scale quantum-classical interfaces in superconducting quantum information processing systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Mori, Francesca Mignacco</p>
            <p>Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xie-Hang Yu, Wen Wei Ho, Pavel Kos</p>
            <p>We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting the Exact Dynamical Structure Factor of the Heisenberg Antiferromagnetic Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.H. Bougourzi</p>
            <p>We revisit our initial derivations of the exact 2-spinon $S_2$ and 4-spinon $S_4$ dynamical structure factors (DSF). First we show that the latter derivations had normalization factors that are twice and quadriple the correct ones respectively. This means that $S_2$ contributes not 72% as was previously thought but 36% to the total DSF. We also calculated the contribution of $S_4$ to be between 18% and 20% and not 27% as was calculated by Caux and Hagemans. In fact we show that the latter reference had also the normalization factor twice the correct value and had it done the numeric integrations correctly it would have obtained a contribution between 36% and 40% for $S_4$. Furthermore, we prove that its claim that our initial derivation of $S_4$ was also incorrect in its dependency on the spectral parameters is incorrect because fixing the momentun transfer $k$ up to $2\pi$ as the latter reference did to justify its claim only amounts to mutltiplying the overall factor by 2 because as we will prove in this paper $S_4$ is periodic in $k$ with period $2\pi$. Also in this paper we derive $S_n$ for general $n$ by following a different approach compared to our initial derivation of $S_4$. Although for $S_4$ both the new derivation and the initial one lead to equivalent formulas that are expressed differently, the new form presented in this paper is much more elegant and compact and also reveals new hidden and nontrivial symmetries which substantially simplify the numeric evaluation of $S_4$ and its sum rules. Moreover based on the results of this paper we propose a simple approximation to the total DSF of the Heisenberg model. Finally we comment on how our work might resolve the discrepancy between the exact theoretic results and experiemntal data as reported by Zaliznyak et al.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.V. Fetisov</p>
            <p>In the works of E. Podkletnov et al. (for example [Physica C: Superconductivity, 1992, Vol. 203, p. 441]), a unique experiment is described in which a significant reduction in the weight of various test bodies was observed when placed above a rotating disk made of the superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+delta (YBCO); the disk was in the superconducting state (at 20-70 K) and was subjected to an alternating (50 Hz-100 MHz) magnetic field. Numerous attempts to replicate this experiment in other laboratories have been unsuccessful; however, a broad discussion has been initiated regarding the possible nature of the "Podkletnov effect" - the weight loss of objects located above the superconductor. In the present experimental work, results similar to the Podkletnov effect have been obtained, which, however, occur at room temperature. During our experiments, gas-tight containers with the crystal hydrate K2CO3X1.5H2O and dispersed YBCO exhibited a sharp loss of part of their weight during and after 0.5 hours of exposure to a magnetic field with a frequency of 50 MHz. Changes in the weight of various test bodies located in close proximity to the containers were recorded. It was found that these weight changes correlate with the external surface area of the bodies and do not depend on their chemical nature. A dependence of the magnitude of weight changes on the oxygen content in YBCO was obtained, which shows a significant dip in the region where superstructural orderings of the oxygen sublattice exist in the basal plane. This dip coincides in shape with the well-known dip in the dependence of Tc on delta (the "60-K plateau"). The possible connection between these two extraordinary phenomena coexisting in YBCO compounds - inexplicable weight changes and high-temperature superconductivity - is discussed.</p>

            <p>Quantum interference can deeply alter the nature of many-body phases of matter. In the paradigmatic case of the Hubbard model, Nagaoka famously proved that introducing a single itinerant charge can transform a paramagnetic insulator into a ferromagnet through path interference. However, a microscopic observation of such kinetic magnetism induced by individually imaged dopants has been so far elusive. Here we demonstrate the emergence of Nagaoka polarons in a Hubbard system realized with strongly interacting fermions in a triangular optical lattice. Using quantum gas microscopy, we reveal these polarons as extended ferromagnetic bubbles around particle dopants arising from the local interplay of coherent dopant motion and spin exchange. In contrast, kinetic frustration due to the triangular geometry promotes antiferromagnetic polarons around hole dopants, as proposed by Haerter and Shastry. Our work augurs the exploration of exotic quantum phases driven by charge motion in strongly correlated systems and over sizes that are challenging for numerical simulation.</p>

The number of trajectories required to accurately estimate free-energy differences in this way grows sharply with the size of work fluctuations, motivating the search for protocols that perform desired transformations with minimum work. However, protocols of this nature can involve varying temperature, to which the Jarzynski equality does not apply. We derive a variant of the Jarzynski equality that applies to varying-temperature protocols, and show that it can have better convergence properties than the standard version of the equality. We derive this modified equality, and the associated fluctuation relation, within the framework of Markovian stochastic dynamics, complementing related derivations done within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics.</p>

            <p>General upper bounds on fluctuations of trajectory observables were recently obtained. It turned out that the size of fluctuations of dynamical observable is limited from below and from above. For the moment generating function of general upper bounds on the size of fluctuations, the moments (average value and variance) of the size of fluctuations are obtained. A more complex and interesting task is to obtain the first-passage time for process of upper bounds on the moments and first-passage time (FPT) of the observable A, which are obtained by calculating the moments and FPT of the process of upper bound. Characteristic functions, average values and variances of the first-passage time of reaching fluctuations of observables of the trajectory of the Markov chain of positive and negative levels are also obtained. Some general issues of the relationship between the theory of random processes (using the example of the risk theory used) and thermodynamics of trajectories are also considered.</p>

            <p>Eigenstate thermalization has been numerically shown to occur for few-body observables in a wide range of nonintegrable models. For intensive sums of few-body observables, a weaker version of eigenstate thermalization known as weak eigenstate thermalization has been proved to occur in general. Here, we unveil a stricter weak eigenstate thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models exhibiting quantum chaos in the single-particle sector (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in integrable interacting models. In such models, we argue that few-body observables that have a properly defined system-size independent norm are guaranteed to exhibit at least a polynomially vanishing variance (over the entire many-body energy spectrum) of the diagonal matrix elements, a phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. We prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the three-dimensional Anderson model in the delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for the integrable interacting spin-1/2 XYZ and XXZ models.</p>

In such multi-band models, quantum interference can lead to dispersionless bands whose large degeneracy gives rise to itinerant magnetism even with weak interactions. Here, we report on signatures of a ferrimagnetic state realized in a Lieb lattice at half-filling, characterized by antialigned magnetic moments with antiferromagnetic correlations, concomitant with a finite spin polarization. We demonstrate their robustness when increasing repulsive interactions from the non-interacting to the Heisenberg regime, and study their emergence when continuously tuning the lattice unit cell from a square to a Lieb geometry. Our work paves the way towards exploring exotic phases in related multi-orbital models such as quantum spin liquids in kagome lattices and heavy fermion behavior in Kondo models.</p>

            <p>In the search of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, the conventional wisdom is to start from a flat Chern band isolated from the rest of the Hilbert space by band gaps, so that many-body interaction can be projected to a landscape that mimics a Landau level. Singular flat bands (SFB), which share protected touching points with other dispersive bands, represent another type of flat landscapes differing from Landau levels and Chern bands in topological and geometric properties. Here we report the finding of FQAH phases in a SFB, which emerges in the bipartite limit of the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. At 1/3 and 2/3 filling of the SFB, FQAH effects are demonstrated using density matrix renormalisation group calculations with all bands, as well as exact diagonalization calculations with the two touching bands. Gapping the band touching can turn the SFB into a nearly flat Chern band, but counter-intuitively this suppresses the FQAH effect, as the gap opening introduces strong inhomogeneity to the quantum geometry. An optical scheme to realize such SFB for cold atoms is provided. Our findings uncover a new arena for the exploration of fractional quantum Hall physics beyond the Landau level and Chern insulator paradigms.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum evolution of one-dimensional Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both theoretically and experimentally. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behaviors of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. We show that the hydrodynamization epoch is itself characterized by two independent timescales, an oscillation period and an observable-dependent damping time. We also show how the existence of a hydrodynamization epoch depends on the exact nature of the high-energy quench. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</p>

            <p>Fundamentally understanding the lattice dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites remains elusive, primarily due to their strong anharmonicity and frequent phase transitions. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the thermal transport behavior in cubic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3, integrating first principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics with a linearized Wigner transport formula. The Temperature Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) technique allows us to stabilize the negative soft modes, primarily dominated by organic cations, at finite temperatures in cubic FAPbI3. We then predict an ultra-low thermal conductivity of ~0.63 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) in cubic FAPbI3 at 300 K, with a temperature dependence of T^(-0.740), suggesting a good crystalline nature of phonon transport. Notably, the ultra-low thermal conductivity in cubic FAPbI3 is primarily attributed to the [PbI3]1- units, challenging the conventional focus on organic FA+ cations. This shift in focus is due to the presence of Pb(s)-I(p) anti-bonding sates within the [PbI3]1- units. Furthermore, thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 is predominantly governed by the particle-like phonon propagation channel across the entire temperature range of 300-500 K, a result of diminished suppression of low-frequency phonons by FA+ cations and large inter-branch spacings. Finally, our findings underscore that the anharmonic force constants are highly temperature-sensitive, leading to underestimations of thermal conductivity when relying on 0-K anharmonic force constants. Our study not only elucidates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 but also provides a crucial framework for the discovery, design, and understanding of hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with ultra-low thermal conductivity.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic theory for electron-phonon coupling in twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziyan Zhu, Thomas P. Devereaux</p>
            <p>The origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene -- whether phonon-driven or electron-driven -- remains unresolved, in part due to the absence of a quantitative and efficient model for electron-phonon coupling (EPC). In this work, we develop a first-principles-based microscopic theory to calculate EPC in twisted bilayer graphene for arbitrary twist angles without requiring a periodic moiré supercell. Our approach combines a momentum-space continuum model for both electronic and phononic structures with a generalized Eliashberg-McMillan theory beyond the adiabatic approximation. Using this framework, we find that the EPC is strongly enhanced near the magic angle. The superconducting transition temperature induced by low-energy phonons peaks at $1.1^\circ$ around 1 K, and remains finite for a range of angles both below and above the magic angles. We predict that superconductivity persists up to $\sim 1.4^\circ$, where superconductivity has been recently observed despite the dispersive electronic bands. Beyond a large density of states, we identify a key condition for strong EPC: resonance between the electronic bandwidth and the dominant phonon frequencies. We also show that the EPC strength of a specific phonon corresponds to the modification of the moiré potential. In particular, we identify several $\Gamma$-phonon branches that contribute most significantly to the EPC, which are experimentally detectable via Raman spectroscopy.</p>

As an example, using the proposed method we solve the one dimensional Kitaev chain and two-dimensional BCS-Hubbard model to show the emergence of topological properties. The proposed procedure is quite general and can be used to analyze different lattice Hamiltonian, provided strong e-e correlation excludes doubly occupied states.</p>

We consider situations where the original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a significant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates having tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our phonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the interaction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie just below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where the sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter bands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the large energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the absence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.</p>

            <p>Loop current order has been suggested as a promising candidate for the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ charge density wave (CDW) revealed in vanadium-based kagomé metals \avs\ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) near van Hove filling $n_\text{vH} = 5/12$. Weak-coupling analyses and mean field calculations have demonstrated that nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_2$ drives, respectively, real and imaginary bond-ordered CDW, with the latter corresponding to time-reversal symmetry breaking loop current CDW. It is important to understand the inter-layer correlation of these bond-ordered CDWs and its consequences in the bulk kagomé materials. To provide physical insights, we investigate in this paper the $c$-axis stacking of them, loop current CDW in particular, on the minimal bilayer kagomé lattice. The bare susceptibilities for stacking of real and imaginary bond orders are calculated for the free electrons on the bilayer kagomé lattice with inter-layer coupling $t_\perp=0.2t$, which splits the van Hove filling to $n_{+\text{vH}}=4.64/12$ and $n_{-\text{vH}}=5.44/12$. While real and imaginary bond-ordered CDWs are still favored, respectively, by $V_1$ and $V_2$, their inter-layer coupling is sensitive to band filling $n$. They tend to stack symmetrically near $n_{\pm\text{vH}}$ with identical bond orders in the two layers and give rise to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 1c_0$ CDW. On the other hand, they prefer to stack antisymmetrically around $n_\text{vH}$ with opposite bond orders in the two layers and lead to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 2c_0$ CDW. The concrete bilayer $t$-$t_\perp$-$V_1$-V$_2$ model is then studied.

            <h2>Learning efficient erasure protocols for an underdamped memory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Barros, Stephen Whitelam, Sergio Ciliberto, Ludovic Bellon</p>
            <p>We apply evolutionary reinforcement learning to a simulation model in order to identify efficient time-dependent erasure protocols for a physical realization of a one-bit memory by an underdamped mechanical cantilever. We show that these protocols, when applied to the cantilever in the laboratory, are considerably more efficient than our best hand-designed protocols. The learned protocols allow reliable high-speed erasure by minimizing the heating of the memory during the operation. More generally, the combination of methods used here opens the door to the rational design of efficient protocols for a variety of physics applications.</p>

            <h2>A note on the deformation of 1D ferromagnetic domain walls due to double exchange interaction with a free electron gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. Seremetas, X. Zotos</p>
            <p>Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the thermodynamic potential and conductance of a Bloch or Néel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron gas via a double exchange interaction. The minimization of the elastic magnetic energy plus electronic thermodynamic potential indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic interaction larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall configuration the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall configurations the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The thermodynamic potential and conductance of Bloch and Néel magnetic domain walls are identical within this prototype model.</p>

            <h2>Growing length and time scales in activity-mediated glassy dynamics in confluent cell monolayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Souvik Sadhukhan, Chandan Dasgupta, Saroj Kumar Nandi</p>
            <p>Activity-mediated unjamming of a confluent glassy system is crucial for several biological processes, such as embryogenesis and cancer metastasis. During these processes, the cells progressively change their junction properties, characterized by an interaction parameter $p_0$, and become motile. Here, we study the effect of nonequilibrium active fluctuations, in the form of self-propulsion, on the glassy dynamics in a confluent system. We simulate the active Vertex model and use the analytical mode-coupling theory (MCT) to show that the nature of the transition in the presence of activity remains similar to that in a thermal system where the fluctuations are temperature-like. The agreement of the simulation results with the MCT predictions demonstrates that the structure-dynamics feedback mechanism controls the relaxation dynamics. In addition, we present the first computation of a dynamic length scale, $\xi_d$, in confluent systems using finite-size scaling, and show that the growing relaxation time exhibita a power-law dependence on $\xi_d$. Furthermore, unlike particulate glasses, the static length that governs the finite-size scaling of the relaxation time is proportional to $\xi_d$, revealing the unique nature of the glassy dynamics in confluent systems.</p>

            <p>Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSS) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) remains an open question. We report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets (AF) up to frequencies of 24 GHz. We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AF. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Out-of-plane bond-order phase, superconductivity, and their competition in the $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model: Possible implications for bilayer nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matías Bejas, Xianxin Wu, Debmalya Chakraborty, Andreas P. Schnyder, Andrés Greco</p>
            <p>Almost four decades of intense research have been invested to study the physics of high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors. The recent discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelates and its potential similarities with cuprate superconductors may open a new window to understand this long-standing problem. We have studied the proposed bilayer $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model [where $J_\parallel$ ($J_\perp$) is the in-plane (out-of-plane) magnetic exchange] in a large-$N$ approach on the basis of the path integral representation for Hubbard operators, which allows to obtain results at mean-field and beyond mean-field level. We find that $J_\perp$ is a candidate for triggering high superconducting $T_c$ values at quarter filling (hole doping $\delta=0.5$) of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Beyond mean-field level, we find a new phase, an out-of-plane bond-order phase (z-BOP), triggered also by $J_\perp$. z-BOP develops below a critical temperature which decreases with increasing doping and vanishes at a quantum critical point below quarter filling. The occurrence of this phase and its competition with superconductivity leads to a superconducting dome-shaped behavior as a function of doping and as a function of $J_\perp$. Qualitative comparisons with the physics of cuprates and the recent literature on the new pressurized nickelates are given along the paper.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Lin Li, Chen-Te Ma, Po-Yao Chang</p>
            <p>We have drawn connections between the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the multi-orbit Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, emphasizing their similarities and differences regarding chaotic behaviors. The features of the spectral form factor, such as the dip-ramp-plateau structure and the adjacent gap ratio, indicate chaos in the disordered orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. One significant conclusion is that the plateau value of the out-of-time-order correlator, whether in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with two- or four-body interactions, or a disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, does not effectively differentiate between integrable and chaotic phases in many-body systems. This observation suggests a limitation in using out-of-time-order correlator plateau values as a diagnostic tool for chaos. Our exploration of these ideas provides a deeper understanding of how chaos arises in non-Fermi liquid systems and the tools we use to study it. It opens the door to further questions, particularly about whether there are more effective ways to distinguish between chaotic and integrable phases in these complex systems.</p>

            <p>In this study, we demonstrate that when a ferroelectric nematic is confined between two glass plates coated with ionic polymers, a modulated phase emerges in a narrow temperature range between the nematic and ferroelectric nematic phases. This modulated phase emerges from the nematic phase in a continuous manner and then transforms into the ferroelectric nematic phase via a first-order transition upon cooling. Using optical microscopy, we provide compelling evidence that this modulated phase corresponds to the theoretically predicted double splay nematic phase. In this phase, splay deformations alternate in two orthogonal directions oriented at 45° to the substrate surfaces, creating a modulation wavelength that is twice the thickness of the cell. Our experiments with different ionic coatings reveal that only polymeric cationic coatings effectively promote the formation of this phase, highlighting the critical role of electrical screening. These findings not only confirm the existence of the double splay nematic phase but also provide insights into the distinctive topological defects of this phase in confined geometries.</p>

            <p>Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the spin contributions to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) in transition metals. The IFE depends on the d-electron filling and asymmetry between excited electron and hole spin moments. Our results reveal that even elements with smaller electron magnetic moments, like Os, can exhibit higher IFE due to greater electron-hole asymmetry. Pt shows the highest IFE in the 1-2 eV frequency range, while Os dominates in the 2-4 eV range. In addition, we demonstrate that the IFE of neighboring elements with similar crystal structures (e.g., Ir, Pt, and Au) can be tuned by adjusting their Fermi levels, indicating the importance of d-electron filling on IFE. Finally, we find that the trend in electron (or hole) contributions to the IFE closely follows that of the spin Hall conductivity, however, the total IFE involves more complex interactions.</p>

            <p>The Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation, which is at the basis of stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), was proposed in the mid-nineties to describe the evolution of the density of interacting Brownian particles, which can represent a large number of systems such as colloidal suspensions, supercooled liquids, polymer melts, biological molecules, active or chemotactic particles, or ions in solution. This theoretical framework, which can be summarized as a mathematical reformulation of the coupled overdamped Langevin equations that govern the dynamics of the particles, has attracted a significant amount of attention during the past thirty years. In this review, I present the context in which this framework was introduced, and I recall the main assumptions and calculation techniques that are employed to derive the DK equation. Then, in the broader context of statistical mechanics, I show how SDFT is connected to other theories, such fluctuating hydrodynamics, macroscopic fluctuation theory, or mode-coupling theory. The mathematical questions that are raised by the DK equation are presented in a non-specialist language. In the last parts of the review, I show how the original result was extended in several directions, I present the different strategies and approximations that have been employed to solve the DK equation, both analytically and numerically. I finally list the different situations where SDFT was employed to describe the fluctuations of Brownian suspensions, from the physics of active matter to the description of charged particles and electrolytes.</p>

            <p>We present a graphene derivative displaying novel topological phenomena without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a collinear altermagnet. Band degeneracies in spin-split honeycomb antiferromagnets produce unique distribution patterns of Berry curvature and give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. The asymmetric Berry curvature due to spin splitting can be created by lifting the degeneracies, which concentrate intensely at Weyl points contributing to carrier dynamics with a large valley Hall effect. The altermagnetism breaks the intrinsic time-reversal symmetry, guaranteeing the formation of pairs of Weyl points associated with the internal spin structure chiralities. We investigate the evolution of Dirac and Weyl crossings, in which topological phase transitions are characterized by the high Chern numbers preserving the non-intersecting flows of Wannier centers over occupied bands. Our results yield unique degeneracy-protected states by leveraging the symmetry constraints, where corresponding experiments are illustrated to demonstrate the potential of advancing valleytronic devices via unconventional topological responses.</p>

            <p>Kagome metals with van Hove singularities near the Fermi level can host intriguing quantum phenomena such as chiral loop currents, electronic nematicity, and unconventional superconductivity. However, to our best knowledge, unconventional magnetic states driven by van Hove singularities--like spin-density waves--have not been observed experimentally in kagome metals. Here, we report the magnetic and electronic structure of the layered kagome metal CeTi3Bi4, where Ti kagome electronic structure interacts with a magnetic sublattice of Ce3+ Jeff = 1/2 moments. Neutron diffraction reveals an incommensurate spin-density wave ground state of the Ce3+ moments, coexisting with commensurate antiferromagnetic order across most of the temperature-field phase diagram. The commensurate component is preferentially suppressed by thermal fluctuations and magnetic field, yielding a rich phase diagram involving an intermediate single-Q spin-density wave phase. First-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy identify van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, with the observed magnetic propagation vectors connecting their high density of states, strongly suggesting a van Hove singularity-assisted spin-density wave. These findings establish kagome metals LnTi3Bi4 as a model platform where the characteristic electronic structure of the kagome lattice plays a pivotal role in magnetic order.</p>

            <p>InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has been recently demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting Josephson Junctions (JJs) and Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs). The InAsOI consists of an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic-electrically-insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer, which allows the electrical decoupling of surface-exposed adjacent devices together with a high critical current density integration. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, allowing an increased gate coupling with the transistor channel with consequent reduced gate operating voltages and leakages. As well as for Si-based FETs, integrating high-k gate insulators with JoFETs promises similar advantages in superconducting electronics. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. We found that both the ungated and gate-tunable electrical properties of the JoFETs are strongly dependent on the insulator chosen. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, from which an edge-peaked supercurrent density distribution was calculated.</p>

Applying this method to monolayer InSe, we demonstrate that self-consistency qualitatively affects the spectral function and transport properties compared to state-of-the-art one-shot calculations and allows one to reconcile calculations with angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The developed method can be widely applied to materials with dominant electron-phonon coupling at a moderate computational cost.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Order-Disorder Phase Transitions Induced by Fluctuations Based on Network Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonglong Ding</p>
            <p>Both quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic phase transitions are probably induced by fluctuations, yet the specific mechanism through which fluctuations cause phase transitions remains unclear in existing theories. This paper summarizes different phases into combinations of three types of network structures based on lattice models transformed into network models. These three network structures correspond to ordered, boundary, and disordered conditions, respectively. By utilizing the transformation relationships satisfied by these three network structures and classical probability, this work derive the high-order detailed balance relationships satisfied by strongly correlated systems. Using the high-order detailed balance formula, this work obtain the weights of the maximum entropy network structures in general cases. Consequently, I clearly describe the process of ordered-disordered phase transitions based on fluctuations and provide critical exponents and phase transition points. Finally, I verify this theory using the Ising model in different dimensions, the frustration scenario of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model, and the expectation of ground-state energy in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.</p>

            <p>Nodal-line semimetals are a class of topological materials hosting one dimensional lines of band degeneracy. Kramers nodal-line (KNL) metals/semimetals have recently been theoretically recognized as a class of topological states inherent to all non-centrosymmetric achiral crystal lattices. We investigate the electronic structure of candidate KNL semimetal YAuGe by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillations as well as by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT has revealed that YAuGe hosts KNLs on the G-A-L-M plane of the Brillouin zone, that are protected by the time reversal and mirror-inversion symmetries. Through ARPES and quantum oscillations we identify signatures of hole bands enclosing the G point, and the observed splitting of quantum oscillation frequency with angle is attributed to spin-orbit-coupling-induced band splitting away from the KNLs. Furthermore, we show that the degeneracy of the nodal lines along the G-A line is lifted by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking when the Y is substituted by magnetic R ions (R = rare earth). This becomes a source of Berry curvature and contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in magnetic RAuGe. These findings establish RAuGe as a new class of KNL semimetals offering significant potential for engineering of anomalous magnetotransport properties via magnetic rare-earth substitution.</p>

            <p>In the study of quantum spin liquids, the Kitaev model plays a pivotal role due to the fact that its ground state is exactly known as well as the fact that it may be realized in strongly frustrated materials such as ${\alpha}$-RuCl${}_3$. While topological insulators and superconductors can be investigated by means of topological band theory -- in particular the topological quantum chemistry (TQC) formalism -- the Kitaev model evades such a treatment, as it is not possible to set up a proper single-particle Green's function for it. We instead associate spin operators with ``orbitals'' that give rise to a band structure. It is thereby possible to analyze the corresponding excitation spectrum engendered by these localized excitations by means of TQC. Special attention is given to the low-energy topological edge mode spectrum. Our work sheds light on the question how the TQC formalism may be generalized to strongly correlated and topologically ordered systems like the Kitaev model.</p>

            <p>In magnetic systems, the microscopic constituents exhibit power law behavior near the paramagnetic transition temperature, $T_C$. The critical exponents (CEs) associated with the physical quantities that demonstrate singular behavior at $T_C$ illustrate the critical behavior, specifically the range and type of exchange interactions emerging in magnetic systems. However, it is realized that the developed methodologies may not yield accurate values of CEs, especially for magnetic systems with competing interactions, referred to as nontrivial magnetic systems. Currently, no comprehensive method effectively addresses the competing effects of the range of magnetic interactions among the constituent entities emerging in such systems. Additionally, there is no definitive explanation for CE values that do not belong to any single universality class. Here, we present new methodologies for critical analysis aimed at determining both the range of exchange interaction(s) and appropriate values of CEs. Using computational and experimental investigations, we analyze the magnetic behavior of trivial Ni and nontrivial Gd. Our findings demonstrate that (i) the critical behavior remains the same on either side of $T_C$, (ii) the critical behavior associated with local electron moments remains unaffected by the magnetic field, and (iii) in Gd, the critical role of competing interactions becomes evident: local electron moments follow a three-dimensional Ising-type short-range interaction, while itinerant electron moments exhibit a mean-field-type long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which weakens under an external magnetic field due to the localization effect on itinerant electrons.</p>

            <p>Multicomponent alloys undergoing irradiation damage develop radiation-induced composition redistribution at point defect sinks such as grain boundaries (GBs) and dislocations. Such redistribution results in undesired changes to their mechanical behavior and corrosion resistance. Additively manufactured alloys proposed for future nuclear applications are expected to demonstrate a distinct response to irradiation owing to their unique microstructure with as-solidified dislocation density and chemical microsegregation. To capture the composition redistribution in such systems, we develop a mesoscale model with coupled evolution of atomic and point defect components in the presence of dislocation density, dislocation heterogeneity, and thermodynamic interactions at the GB. The model is parameterized for an FCC Fe-Cr-Ni alloy as a representative system for austenitic stainless steels, and simulations are performed in 1D and 2D as a function of irradiation temperature, dose, dislocation density, and grain size. Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) characterized by Cr depletion and Ni enrichment is predicted at both the GB and the dislocation cell wall, with RIS being lower in magnitude but wider at the cell wall. Strongly biased absorption of self-interstitials by dislocations is found to suppress Ni enrichment but slightly enhance Cr depletion under certain conditions. Thermodynamic segregation at the GB is predicted to be narrower and opposite in sign to RIS for both Cr and Ni. Importantly, non-monotonic segregation is found to occur when both thermodynamic and RIS mechanisms are considered, providing a novel physical interpretation of experimental observations. The model is expected to serve as a key tool in accelerated qualification of irradiated materials.</p>

Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond.

In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.</p>

            <h2>Anderson transition symmetries at the band-edge of a correlated tin monolayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathieu Lizée, Mohammadmehdi Torkzadeh, François Debontridder, Marie Hervé, Christophe Brun, Tristan Cren</p>
            <p>The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its Mott and antiferromagnetic behavior, as it undergoes a metal-insulator transition near a band edge. By analyzing spatial correlations of the local density of states (LDOS) using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge and determine its critical exponent as $\nu$ = 0.75 $\pm$ 0.1. We show that both the LDOS distribution functions and the multifractal spectra obey two exact symmetry relations, which are based on the Weyl group symmetry of nonlinear sigma-models. These symmetries hold across the entire transition, from extended to strongly localized states, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Overall, using tunneling spectroscopy maps on a model tin monolayer in combination with numerical models, we connect the localization patterns of disordered electronic systems with their Hamiltonian symmetry class.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic exciton transport and recombination in single-crystal lead bromide perovskite</h2>

            <p>Photogenerated carrier transport and recombination in metal halide perovskites are critical to device performance. Despite considerable efforts, sample quality issues and measurement techniques have limited the access to their intrinsic physics. Here, by utilizing high-purity CsPbBr3 single crystals and contact-free transient grating spectroscopy, we directly monitor exciton diffusive transport from 26 to 300 K. As the temperature (T) increases, the carrier mobility ({\mu}) decreases rapidly below 100 K wtih a {\mu}~T^{-3.0} scaling, and then follows a more gradual {\mu}~T^{-1.7} trend at higher temperatures. First-principles calculations perfectly reproduce this experimental trend and reveal that optical phonon scattering governs carrier mobility shifts over the entire temperature range, with a single longitudinal optical mode dominating room-temperature transport. Time-resolved photoluminescence further identifies a substantial increase in exciton radiative lifetime with temperature, attributed to increased exciton population in momentum-dark states caused by phonon scattering. Our findings unambiguously resolve previous theory-experiment discrepancies, providing benchmarks for future optoelectronic design.</p>

            <h2>Origin of second harmonic generation in non-centrosymmetric crystal structures containing lone-pairs electrons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuming Li, Shilie Pan, Zhihua Yang</p>
            <p>Material systems with lone-pair electrons have long been a treasure trove in the search for large second harmonic generation effects. Revealing the origin of second harmonic generation in nonlinear optical materials can provide theoretical guidance for the design of new materials. In this work, the origin of second harmonic generation in non-centrosymmetric materials containing lone pair electrons is revealed by analyzing the orbital interactions on the sublattice. Stereochemically inactive Pb 6\textit{s} orbitals with high symmetry in CsPbCO3F contribute less to the second harmonic generation. In contrast, the contribution of stereochemically active Pb 6s orbital in PbB5O7F3 and PbB2O3F2 is more obvious. Significantly, the orbitals of the interaction between lead and oxygen make a very significant contribution because these orbitals are located at the band edge and in non-centrosymmetric sublattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasuya Nakayama</p>
            <p>We review the theoretical aspects of determining linear rheology using passive microrheology from simulations under periodic boundary conditions (PBC). It is common to impose periodic boundary conditions when evaluating bulk properties by molecular simulation. The Brownian motion of the probe particles is affected by PBCs, and thus their effects must be considered when microrheological analysis is applied to evaluate the dynamic modulus. First, we review the theory of microrheology based on the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in an unbounded domain. Then, we briefly discuss the effect of periodic boundary conditions on the diffusion coefficient. After that, we explain the effect of PBCs on the mean-square displacement of Brownian particles and their impact on microrheology. The passive microrheology technique under PBCs provides a new approach for rheology evaluation in molecular simulations of complex liquids in addition to the traditional Green--Kubo formula and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD).</p>

            <p>Accurately describing liquids and their mixtures beyond equilibrium remains a significant challenge in modern chemical physics and physical chemistry, especially regarding the calculation of transport properties in liquid-phase systems. This paper introduces a phenomenological nonequilibrium theory specifically designed for multicomponent liquid-phase solutions. Our field-theoretical framework, rooted in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, incorporates quasi-stationary concentration fluctuations that align with equilibrium liquid theory as described by classical density functional theory. This method serves as a phenomenological extension of the established Dean-Kawasaki stochastic density functional theory, enabling the computation of shear viscosity. We apply our approach to derive general formula for the shear viscosity in single-solute solutions. Our findings yield new results and successfully reproduce previously established results for such systems as solutions containing soft-core particles, hard spheres, one-component plasma, and near-critical solutions.</p>

            <h2>Comparative analysis of methods for calculating Hubbard parameters using cRPA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, M. Kaltak, Bongjae Kim</p>
            <p>In this study, we present a systematic comparison of various approaches within the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) for calculating the Coulomb interaction parameter $U$. While defining the correlated space is straightforward for disentangled bands, the situation is more complex for entangled bands, where different projection schemes from hybridized bands to the target space can yield varying sizes of interaction parameters. We systematically evaluated different methods for calculating the polarizability functions within the correlated space. Furthermore, we analyze how different definitions of the correlated space, often constructed through Wannierization from Kohn-Sham orbitals, defines the orbital localization and play a crucial role in determining the interaction parameter. To illustrate these effects, we consider two sets of representative correlated d-orbital oxides: LiMO$_{2}$ (M = V-Ni) as examples of isolated d-electron systems and SrMO$_{3}$ (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cases of entangled d-electron systems. Through this systematic comparison, we provide a detailed analysis of different cRPA methodologies for computing the Hubbard parameters.</p>

            <p>The incorporation of dilute concentrations of bismuth (Bi) into traditional III V alloys leads to significant reduction in bandgap energy, making InSbBi is a promising candidate for long wavelength infrared photodetection sensors due to its small bandgap (<0.17 eV). Furthermore, InSbBi could serve as a valuable platform for spin dynamics and quantum phenomena due to its strong spin-orbit coupling. Despite its potential, the material quality of InSbBi alloys lags behind that of conventional III V semiconductors, primarily due to the substantial challenges associated with incorporating Bi into InSb and producing high-quality InSbBi with varying Bi compositions. In this study, we address these issues by developing a method for growing smooth InSbBi thin films with tunable Bi incorporation up to 1.81% by the dynamic adjustment of Sb flux and careful control of the interplay between growth temperature and Bi flux using molecular beam epitaxy. This work paves the path for high-quality InSbBi thin films for applications in photodetection, spintronics, and quantum technology.</p>

Calculations confirm the elliptical stability of hopfions and the previously obtained analytical expression for the upper critical field of their lattice. Dependencies of the hopfion lattice periods on the magnitude of the applied external magnetic field and the uniaxial anisotropy constant of the material are obtained. It is shown that in an anisotropic helimagnet, the hopfion lattice expands in the direction of the anisotropy axis, and the expansion can be controlled by the external field and the uniaxial anisotropy constant.</p>

            <p>We investigate a non-Hermitian extension of the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger model that incorporates spin-dependent SU(2) gauge fields, represented by non-Abelian couplings between lattice sites, as well as independent nonreciprocal hopping amplitudes. This framework gives rise to a rich phase structure characterized by complex-energy braiding and tunable non-Hermitian skin effects. By employing the generalized Brillouin zone approach, we analyze the bulk-boundary correspondence and identify topological transitions protected by chiral symmetry. Notably, we demonstrate that non-Abelian gauge fields significantly enhance the dynamical resilience of the system, enabling robust self-healing under a moving scattering potential. These results clarify the role of SU(2) gauge fields in stabilizing non-Hermitian topological phases and indicate that the proposed model can be realized with currently available photonic, atomic, and superconducting experimental platforms.</p>

            <h2>An all-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sachchidanand Das, Abhiram Soori</p>
            <p>We propose an all-electrical setup to generate valley polarization in graphene. A finite graphene sheet is connected to two normal metal electrodes each with two terminals along its zigzag edges, while the armchair edges remain free. When a bias is applied to one terminal and the others are grounded, valley polarization emerges due to transverse momentum matching between the graphene and the metal electrodes. Significant valley polarization is achieved when the Fermi wave vector in the metal exceeds half the separation between the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys in graphene. We analyze how conductance and valley polarization depend on geometric and electronic parameters. While increasing the width enhances both conductance and polarization, increasing the length introduces Fabry--Pérot oscillations and suppresses valley polarization due to enhanced intervalley mixing. We also examine the effects of disorder: on-site disorder in graphene near the Dirac point increases conductance but reduces valley polarization. Finally, we study the impact of imperfect armchair edges and interface roughness, finding that moderate deviations from ideal conditions still yield substantial valley polarization. Our results demonstrate a viable route to electrically controlling valley degrees of freedom in graphene-based devices.</p>

Here we demonstrate a subtle competition between cavity frequency and interlayer tunneling in graphene stacks that is responsible for topological phase transitions in light-matter Hilbert space and that cannot be captured by mean-field theory in vacuum. A systematic exploration of multilayer graphene heterostructures and stacking configurations in a chiral tHz cavity reveals that linear dispersion enhances the low-energy cavity-induced topological gap. Furthermore, in bilayer graphene, a displacement field drives the low-energy vacuum band from valley-Chern to Chern insulator, comprising a gate-tunable topological phase transition. Our findings pave the way for future control and engineering of graphene heterostructures with chiral cavity fields.</p>

            <p>We present GPR_calculator, a package based on Python and C++ programming languages to build an on-the-fly surrogate model using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to approximate expensive electronic structure calculations. The key idea is to dynamically train a GPR model during the simulation that can accurately predict energies and forces with uncertainty quantification. When the uncertainty is high, the expensive electronic structure calculation is performed to obtain the ground truth data, which is then used to update the GPR model. To illustrate the power of GPR_calculator, we demonstrate its application in Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) simulations of surface diffusion and reactions, achieving 3-10 times acceleration compared to pure ab initio calculations.

Using a modified SegFormer architecture, our approach achieves high segmentation performance on unseen data while reducing processing time from hours to seconds per 3D dataset. The method maintains consistent performance over significant morphological changes during experiments, despite training only on static specimens. This methodology can be readily applied to diverse materials systems, accelerating the analysis of time-resolved tomographic data across scientific disciplines.</p>

            <p>Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.</p>

In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets are a newly identified family of collinear antiferromagnets with momentum-dependent spin-split band structure of non-relativistic origin, derived from spin-group symmetry-protected crystal structures. Among candidate altermagnets, CrSb is attractive for potential applications because of a large spin-splitting near the Fermi level and a high Neel transition temperature of around 700 K. We use molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize CrSb (0001) thin films with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm. Structural characterization, using reflection high energy electron diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, demonstrates the growth of epitaxial films with good crystallinity. Polarized neutron reflectometry shows the absence of any net magnetization, consistent with antiferromagnetic order. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements probe the band structure in a previously unexplored regime of film thickness, down to 10 nm. These ARPES measurements show a three-dimensional momentum-dependent band splitting of up to 0.7 eV with g-wave symmetry, consistent with that seen in prior studies of bulk single crystals. The distinct altermagnetic band structure required for potential spin-transport applications survives down to the 10 nm thin film limit at room temperature.</p>

            <p>Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experiments, confirming that the synchronized temperature ramp-down can fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized temperature ramp-down can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we explore the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the temperature ramp-down can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution. The findings not only provide a robust method for stabilizing various superconducting magnet systems, including high-temperature superconducting magnets wound with second-generated (2G) coated tapes, but also suggest a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in other nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.</p>

            <p>In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</p>

            <p>Self-assemblies, structured via nanoparticles, show promise as materials for advanced applications, like photonic devices, electrochemical energy storage units and catalysis support. Despite observing diverse morphologies, a comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we show that the coordination interaction between metal sulfide nanoparticles (MS NPs) and the fluorosurfactants at the droplet interface influences the morphology during the evaporation-induced self-assembly facilitated by droplet microfluidics. Further investigation into fluorosurfactants with various chemical groups and MS NPs reveals that the strength of coordination interactions significantly influences assembly morphology. The interfacial interactions can be eliminated through coating a SiO2 layer on the metal colloid (M@SiO2 NPs). In addition, we demonstrate that the morphologies of the self-assemblies can be engineered via the coordination interactions between the MS NPs and fluorosurfactants, and by varying the concentrations of MS NPs. Utilizing these interfacial interactions, assemblies with core-shell and homogeneous distribution of binary nanoparticles were constructed. Our findings offer novel insights into the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the droplet interface through evaporation-induced self-assembly, and into the design of metal colloidal assemblies with diverse morphologies, crucial for developing novel functional assemblies for catalysis, plasmonic, and porous materials in a controlled manner.</p>

            <p>The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature TC, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to inter-band scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multi-band superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by inter-band scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying elementary crystal defects in the form of stacking faults with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune inter-band coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multi-band superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.</p>

In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers an enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source Vermouth python library. Vermouth is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the Vermouth library, the Martinize2 program is showcased as a generalization of the martinize script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, Martinize2 automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network (EN), and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, Martinize2 is used in two high-complexity benchmarks. The entire I-TASSER protein template database as well as a subset of 200,000 structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database are converted to CG resolution and we illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safeguard high-throughput applications.</p>

            <h2>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</p>

            <p>Bloch wavefunctions in crystals experience localization within the bulk when disorder is introduced, a phenomenon commonly known as Anderson localization. This effect is considered universal, being applicable to all types of waves, quantum or classical. However, the interaction between disorder and topology -- a concept that has profoundly transformed many branches of physics -- necessitates revisiting the original Anderson localization picture. For instance, in the recently discovered topological Anderson insulator, the introduction of disorder induces topological boundary states that can resist localization due to protection from line-gap topology. While line-gap topology applies to both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems uniquely exhibit point-gap topology, which has no Hermitian counterparts and leads to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, we experimentally demonstrate disorder-induced point-gap topology in a non-Hermitian acoustic crystal. This crystal, with non-Hermitian disorder in nearest-neighbor couplings, exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect, where all eigenstates localize at a boundary. Interestingly, the boundary where localization occurs -- either the left or right -- depends on the strength of the disorder. As the disorder strength increases, the direction of boundary localization can be reversed. Additionally, we observe a ``bipolar" skin effect, where boundary localization occurs at both the left and right boundaries when disorder is introduced in next-nearest-neighbor couplings. These findings experimentally reveal a non-Hermitian mechanism of disorder-induced localization that goes beyond the conventional framework of Anderson localization.</p>

            <h2>Realizing non-trivial doublon formation using a quantum computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Biswajit Paul, Tapan Mishra</p>
            <p>Dynamical formation of doublons or onsite repulsively bound pairs of particles on a lattice is a highly non-trivial phenomenon. In this work, we show the signatures of doublon formation in a quantum computer by simulating the continuous time quantum walk in the framework of the one dimensional extended Fermi-Hubbard model. By considering two up-component and one down-component particles initially created at the three neighbouring sites at the middle of the lattice and allowing intra- (inter-) component nearest neighbour (onsite) interactions we show the formation a stable onsite doublon in the quantum walk. The probability of such doublon formation is more (less) if the hopping strength of the down particle is weaker (stronger) compared to the up particle. On the contrary, for an initial doublon along with a free up particle, the stability of the doublon is more prominent than the doublon dissociation in the dynamics irrespective of the hopping asymmetry between the two components. We first numerically obtain the signatures of the stable doublon formation in the dynamics and then observe them using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.</p>

            <h2>Gibbs-preserving operations requiring infinite amount of quantum coherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroyasu Tajima, Ryuji Takagi</p>
            <p>Gibbs-preserving operations have been studied as one of the standard free processes in quantum thermodynamics. Although they admit a simple mathematical structure, their operational significance has been unclear due to the potential hidden cost to implement them using an operatioanlly motivated class of operations, such as thermal operations. Here, we show that this hidden cost can be infinite -- we present a family of Gibbs-preserving operations that cannot be implemented by thermal operations aided by any finite amount of quantum coherence. Our result implies that there are uncountably many Gibbs-preserving operations that require unbounded thermodynamic resources to implement, raising a question about employing Gibbs-preserving operations as available thermodynamics processes. This finding is a consequence of the general lower bounds we provide for the coherence cost of approximately implementing a certain class of Gibbs-preserving operations with a desired accuracy. We find that our lower bound is almost tight, identifying a quantity -- related to the energy change caused by the channel to implement -- as a fundamental quantifier characterizing the coherence cost for the approximate implementation of Gibbs-preserving operations.</p>

            <h2>From Single Genes to Populations: Quantifying Broken Detailed Balance in Transcription</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Holehouse</p>
            <p>Are there thermodynamic or information theoretic constraints governing mRNA expression? Here we use the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to assess detailed balance breaking in transcription. For the canonical two-state model of transcription, we derive exact analytic expressions for the entropy production rate of transcription at steady state, expressions that can be evaluated from knowledge of the kinetic parameters of the two-state model. This allows us to easily evaluate the entropy production rate of thousands of genes across seven datasets of two-state model parameters without needing to evaluate the entropy production rate from trajectory-based computation. A data-driven approach then exposes that most genes avoid parameter regimes associated with large entropy production rates, akin to a mesoscopic version of energy expenditure minimization. Importantly, we show that this is not a thermodynamic phenomenon, since the entropy production rate from the two state gene model provides only a weak bound on the housekeeping energy needed to power transcription. Finally, we show that cell-to-cell variability can make mRNA expression seem more or less irreversible than a ``representative cell'' would imply. Overall, our study presents a theoretical and data-driven approach to uncovering the potential thermodynamic and information theoretic constraints that dictate observed behaviors in transcription.</p>

            <p>Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least connected nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. As an application of the method, we present a scheme to detect multiple core-periphery structures and the decomposition of coarse-grained supernode networks, by combining the method with the network community detection.</p>

            <h2>Pfaffian structure of the eigenvector overlap for the symplectic Ginibre ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gernot Akemann, Sung-Soo Byun, Kohei Noda</p>
            <p>We study the integrable structure and scaling limits of the conditioned eigenvector overlap of the symplectic Ginibre ensemble of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices with independent quaternion elements. The average of the overlap matrix elements constructed from left and right eigenvectors, conditioned to $x$, are derived in terms of a Pfaffian determinant. Regarded as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas with the Neumann boundary condition along the real axis, it contains a kernel of skew-orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2(1+|z-x|^2)e^{-2|z|^2}$, including a non-trivial insertion of a point charge. The mean off-diagonal overlap is related to the diagonal (self-)overlap by a transposition, in analogy to the complex Ginibre ensemble. For $x$ conditioned to the real line, extending previous results at $x=0$, we determine the skew-orthogonal polynomials and their skew-kernel with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$. This is done in two steps and involves a Christoffel perturbation of the weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, by computing first the corresponding quantities for the unperturbed weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$. Its kernel is shown to satisfy a differential equation at finite matrix size $N$. This allows us to take different large-$N$ limits, where we distinguish bulk and edge regime along the real axis. The limiting mean diagonal overlaps and corresponding eigenvalue correlation functions of the point processes with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$ are determined. We also examine the effect on the planar orthogonal polynomials when changing the variance in $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, as this appears in the eigenvector statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble.</p>

            <h2>Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</p>

            <h2>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksei Khindanov, Igor L. Aleiner, Lara Faoro, Lev B. Ioffe</p>
            <p>One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</p>

            <h2>Discrete distributions are learnable from metastable samples</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijith Jayakumar, Andrey Y. Lokhov, Sidhant Misra, Marc Vuffray</p>
            <p>Physically motivated stochastic dynamics are often used to sample from high-dimensional distributions. However such dynamics often get stuck in specific regions of their state space and mix very slowly to the desired stationary state. This causes such systems to approximately sample from a metastable distribution which is usually quite different from the desired, stationary distribution of the dynamic. We rigorously show that, in the case of multi-variable discrete distributions, the true model describing the stationary distribution can be recovered from samples produced from a metastable distribution under minimal assumptions about the system. This follows from a fundamental observation that the single-variable conditionals of metastable distributions that satisfy a strong metastability condition are on average close to those of the stationary distribution. This holds even when the metastable distribution differs considerably from the true model in terms of global metrics like Kullback-Leibler divergence or total variation distance. This property allows us to learn the true model using a conditional likelihood based estimator, even when the samples come from a metastable distribution concentrated in a small region of the state space. Explicit examples of such metastable states can be constructed from regions that effectively bottleneck the probability flow and cause poor mixing of the Markov chain. For specific cases of binary pairwise undirected graphical models (i.e. Ising models), we extend our results to further rigorously show that data coming from metastable states can be used to learn the parameters of the energy function and recover the structure of the model.</p>

            <h2>Inhomogeneous SU(2) symmetries in homogeneous integrable U(1) circuits and transport</h2>

            <p>Symmetries are important for understanding equilibrium as well as nonequilibrium properties like transport. In translationally invariant extended systems one might expect symmetry generators to also be homogeneous. Studying qubit circuits with nearest-neighbor U(1) gates we show that this needs not be the case. We find new inhomogeneous screw SU(2) and ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$ symmetries whose generators exhibit a spatial quasi-momentum modulation. They can be viewed as a parameter-dependent generalization of the standard rotational symmetry of the Heisenberg model and can be identified by the Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of a momentum-resolved propagator. Rich integrability structure is reflected also in transport: picking an arbitrary U(1) gate and varying the gate duration one will transition through different phases, including fractal ballistic transport, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang superdiffusion at the critical manifold that also contains helix states, diffusion, and localization. To correctly explain transport the non-local SU(2) symmetries do not matter, while the inhomogeneous local ones that almost commute with the propagator do.</p>

            <p>Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a full qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.</p>

            <p>We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and bulk conformal field theories and their applications to various phenomena in topologically ordered systems. We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760 closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants.</p>

            <p>We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave function in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.</p>

We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit.

Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</p>

            <p>From a structural point of view, plasmonic nanoparticles are always at least two-layer structures with a dielectric layer of stabilizing, targeting, fluorescent, Raman, or other functional molecules. To optimize the optical properties of such bioconjugates, one needs efficient analytical models based on simple physical ideas and with reasonable accuracy comparable to rigorous numerical methods requiring significant computer resources. Recently, we suggested an analytical approach based on a combination of the modal expansion method (MEM) and the dipole equivalence method (DEM). Here, we extend the MEM+DEM approach for particles of various shapes and orientations. To illustrate the possibilities of our method, we calculate extinction and scattering spectra of gold and silver nanorods, nanodiscs, triangle nanoprisms, bicones, and bipyramids with a dielectric coating thickness from 0 to 100 nm. For the main plasmonic peaks, we found excellent agreement between our analytical method and numerical simulations performed with COMSOL, except for some disagreement between MEM and COMSOL solutions for bicones with small rounding radii. To illustrate the application of our method, we prepared 12 AuNR samples using a chemical etching with fine tuning of the LPR over the 1020-580 nm range. By including the CTAB shell in the simulation model, we achieved excellent agreement between the calculated and measured dependence of the LPR peak position on the AuNR aspect ratio. In summary, our method uses the MEM parameters of the original metal particles and does not require additional numerical calculations to build analytical models for bilayered or multilayered conjugates. Due to the simplicity and reasonable accuracy analytical models, they can help apply machine learning to predict various plasmonic responses such as light absorption, scattering, SERS, and metal-enhanced fluorescence.</p>

            <p>In recent years, various nanoporous solid sorbents have drawn significant research interest as promising carbon capture materials. However, the issues of high synthesis cost, limited CO2 adsorption capacity, slow adsorption-desorption kinetics, high sorbent regeneration temperature, and poor operational stability remain challenges to overcome before their practical implementation. In contrast, natural silk-fibroin, a blend of various amino acids, could be a promising material to realize low-cost carbon capture technology due to its amine-like CO2 capture behavior, light weight, natural abundance, scalable processing, and biocompatibility. Here, we present mulberry silk-derived silk-nano-fibroin aerogel that exhibits a high specific surface area and a remarkably high CO2 adsorption capacity (~3.65+-0.18 mmol CO2/gm sorbent at 0.15 atm CO2 and 5 oC), making it competitive with state-of-the-art solid sorbents. The thermogravimetry analysis reveals that the thermal degradation temperature of silk-nano-fibroin aerogel is around 250 °C, significantly higher than conventional amines used for carbon capture. Furthermore, the silk-nano-fibroin-based sorbent demonstrates rapid adsorption-desorption kinetics, complete regeneration at a temperature as low as 60 °C, promising stability over multiple adsorption-desorption cycles, and maintains its adsorption capacity under humid conditions.

            <h2>Quantum thermodynamics and semi-definite optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nana Liu, Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at solving SDPs.</p>

            <h2>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</p>

            <h2>Narrowband, angle-stable, and highly efficient polariton organic light emitting diodes employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Mischok, Simon Lennartz, Vanessa Gruber, Francisco Tenopala-Carmona, Julia Witt, Sabina Hillebrandt, Malte C. Gather</p>
            <p>Narrowband emission is crucial for next generation optoelectronic devices to satisfy demands for high color brilliance. Microcavities can narrow emission spectra of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) through the creation of resonant standing waves, independent of emitter material, enabling flexibility in molecular and device design. However, they induce a strong angle-dependence of the perceived emission color. Utilizing strong light-matter coupling of cavity photons with the virtually angle-independent exciton, leads to exciton-polariton emission showing reduced linewidths and suppressed angular dispersion if tuned correctly. Creating polaritons in highly efficient materials such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is however difficult as their low oscillator strengths intrinsically disfavor light-matter interaction. Here, we present the successful combination of a highly efficient but intrinsically broadband TADF emitter with a strongly absorbing assistant strong coupling material in a modified microcavity structure. Through optimizing the assistant strong coupling layer architecture, we demonstrate polariton OLEDs with exceptionally narrowband, angle stable emission at external quantum efficiencies above 20% for both bottom- and top-emitting designs, more than doubling the performance of previous record devices. The results pave the way for utilizing polaritonic emission at practical device efficiencies for display applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Mehio, Yuchen Han, Xinwei Li, Honglie Ning, Zach Porter, Stephen D. Wilson, David Hsieh</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional Mott insulators host antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations that are predicted to enhance the attractive interaction between empty (holons) and doubly occupied (doublons) sites, creating a novel pathway for exciton formation. However, experimental confirmation of this spin-mediated binding mechanism remains elusive. Leveraging the distinct magnetic critical properties of the Mott antiferromagnets Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, we show using time-resolved THz spectroscopy that excitons only exist at temperatures below where short-range AFM correlation develops. The excitons remain stable up to photodoping densities approaching the predicted excitonic Mott insulator-to-metal transition, revealing a unique robustness against screening. Our results establish the viability of spin-bound excitons and introduce opportunities for excitonic control through magnetic degrees of freedom.</p>

            <h2>A Hubbard exciton fluid in a photo-doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator</h2>

            <p>The undoped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator naturally has one charge carrier per lattice site. When it is doped with additional carriers, they are unstable to spin fluctuation-mediated Cooper pairing as well as other unconventional types of charge, spin, and orbital current ordering. Photo-excitation can produce charge carriers in the form of empty (holons) and doubly occupied (doublons) sites that may also exhibit charge instabilities. There is evidence that antiferromagnetic correlations enhance attractive interactions between holons and doublons, which can then form bound pairs known as Hubbard excitons, and that these might self-organize into an insulating Hubbard exciton fluid. However, this out-of-equilibrium phenomenon has not been detected experimentally. Here, we report the transient formation of a Hubbard exciton fluid in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ using ultrafast terahertz conductivity. Following photo-excitation, we observe rapid spectral weight transfer from a Drude metallic response to an insulating response. The latter is characterized by a finite energy peak originating from intra-excitonic transitions, whose assignment is corroborated by our numerical simulations of an extended Hubbard model. The lifetime of the peak is short, approximately one picosecond, and scales exponentially with Mott gap size, implying extremely strong coupling to magnon modes.</p>

Given the precision and timescales currently achievable, our results indicate that the detection of many-body quantum chaos is feasible, but constrained to small system sizes.</p>

            <p>With the global transition towards cleaner energy and sustainable processes, the demand for efficient catalysts, especially for the oxygen reduction reaction, has gained attention from the scientific community. This research work investigates cerium-doped graphene-based materials as catalysts for this process with density functional theory calculations. The electrochemical performance of Ce-doped graphene was assessed within the computation hydrogen electrode framework. Our findings reveal that Ce doping, especially when synergized with an oxygen atom, shows improved catalytic activity and selectivity. For instance, Ce doping in combination with an oxygen atom, located near a border, can be selective for the 2-electron pathway. Overall, the combination of Ce doping with structural defects and oxygenated functions lowers the reaction free energies for the oxygen reduction compared to pure graphene, and consequently, might improve the catalytic activity. This research sheds light from a computational perspective on Ce-doped carbon materials as a sustainable alternative to traditional costly metal-based catalysts, offering promising prospects for green energy technologies and electrochemical applications.</p>

            <h2>Static and dynamic theory of polarization under internal and directing electric fields: Fixed-charge and fixed-potential conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akira Onuki</p>
            <p>We present a continuum theory on statics and dynamics of polar fluids, where the orientational polarization ${\bi p}_1$ and the induced polarization ${\bi p}_2$ are governed by the Onsager directing field ${\bi E}_d$ and the Lorentz internal field $\bi F$, respectively. We start with a dielectric free energy functional $\cal F$ with a cross term $\propto \int\hspace{-0.5mm} d{\bi r}~{\bi p}_1\cdot{\bi p}_2$, which was proposed by Felderhof $[$J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. {\bf 12}, 2423 (1979)$]$. With this cross-coupling, our theory can yield the theoretical results by Onsager and Kirkwood. We also present dynamic equations using the functional derivatives $\delta {\cal F}/\delta {\bi p}_i$ to calculate the space-time correlations of ${\bi p}_i$. We then obtain analytic expressions for various frequency-dependent quantities including the Debye formula. We find that the fluctuations of the total polarization drastically depend on whether we fix the electrode charge or the applied potential difference between parallel metal electrodes. In the latter fixed-potential condition, we obtain a nonlocal (long-range) polarization correlation inversely proportional to the cell volume $V$, which is crucial to understand the dielectric response. It is produced by nonlocal charge fluctuations on the electrode surfaces and is sensitive to the potential drops in the Stern layers in small systems. These nonlocal correlations in the bulk and on the surfaces are closely related due to the global constraint of fixed potential difference. We also add some results in other boundary conditions including the periodic one, where nonlocal correlations also appear.</p>

            <h2>An Exactly Solvable Model of Phase-Fluctuating Superconductivity in Cuprates: The Role of Partially Flat Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. Shi, F. Yang, L. Q. Chen</p>
            <p>Utilizing an exactly solvable Hubbard-like model that exhibits a pseudogap (PG) phase and a partially flat band, we perform self-consistent microscopic calculations of the superconductivity (SC) in cuprates, incorporating both thermal and zero-point superconducting phase fluctuations in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. The results reveal an important role of the partially flat band in determining phase-fluctuating SC as well as several key features that are consistent with experimental observations. Specifically, we find a dome-shaped $d$-wave superconducting region in the temperature-doping phase diagram with the optimal doping point located near the quantum critical point between the PG and the metallic phases. Near the optimal doping, the partially flat band suppresses and amplifies the fluctuation-induced destructing effect on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave pairing, respectively, ensuring an absolutely dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave SC. While the phase fluctuations of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave SC are relatively weak around optimal doping, they become significant in both underdoped and overdoped regimes. We then identify a discontinuity on the superconducting dome in underdoped regime that results from a transition from a strong- to a weak-phase-fluctuating state as doping approaches the optimal point.</p>

            <p>Photon upconversion has potential applications in light-emitting diodes, photocatalysis, bio-imaging, microscopy, 3D printing, and photovoltaics. Bulk lead-halide perovskite films have emerged as promising sensitisers for solid-state photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. In this system, a perovskite sensitiser absorbs photons and subsequently generates triplet excitons in an adjacent emitter material, where triplet-triplet annihilation can occur allowing for the emission of higher energy photons. However, a major loss pathway in perovskite-sensitised upconversion is the back-transfer of singlet excitons from the emitter to the sensitiser via Förster Resonance Energy Transfer. In this investigation we introduce a 2D perovskite spacer layer between the bulk perovskite sensitiser and a rubrene emitter to mitigate back-transfer of singlet excitons from rubrene to the bulk perovskite sensitiser. This modification reveals the inherent balance between efficient triplet exciton transfer across the interface with a potential barrier versus the mitigation of near-field back-transfer by increasing the distance between the sensitiser and singlet excitons in the emitter. Notably, the introduction of this spacer layer enhances the relative upconversion efficiency at lower excitation power densities while also sustaining performance over extended timescales. This work represents significant progress toward the practical applications of perovskite-sensitised photon upconversion.</p>

We simulated linear and circular random speckle potentials in 1D and 2D, respectively. Our calculation shows that the condensate density forms a sharp ring in 2D, and the condensate is divided into two parts in 1D at a high impurity density of speckle potential. We have calculated the energy and chemical potential of the system by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation to see the stability of the condensate. In our study, we have seen that the nature of the impurity response is the same for one-dimensional and two-dimensional quantum droplets.</p>

            <p>Long wavelength dynamics of 1D Bose gases with repulsive contact interactions can be captured by Generalized HydroDynamics (GHD) which predicts the evolution of the local rapidity distribution. The latter corresponds to the momentum distribution of quasiparticles, which have infinite lifetime owing to the integrability of the system. Here we experimentally investigate the dynamics for an initial situation that is the junction of two semi-infinite systems in different stationary states, a protocol referred to as "bipartite quench" protocol. More precisely we realise the particular case where one half of the system is the vacuum state. We show that the evolution of the boundary density profile exhibits ballistic dynamics obeying the Euler hydrodynamic scaling. The boundary profiles are similar to the ones predicted with zero-temperature GHD in the quasi-BEC regime, with deviations due to non-zero entropy effects. We show that this protocol, provided the boundary profile is measured with infinite precision, permits to reconstruct the rapidity distribution of the initial state. For our data, we extract the initial rapidity distribution by fitting the boundary profile and we use a 3-parameter ansatz that goes beyond the thermal assumption. Finally, we investigate the local rapidity distribution inside the boundary profile, which, according to GHD, presents, on one side, features of zero-entropy states. The measured distribution shows the asymmetry predicted by GHD, although unelucidated deviations remain.</p>

In the present work, we address the challenge of investigating the diverse physics associated with a variety of twist-angles in a simple graphene platform which is economic and bypasses the tedious process of fabricating multiple devices, each with one twist angle. We used turbostratic graphene films containing a variety of twist angles characterized by distinct Moiré patterns observed through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and distinct signatures recorded by Raman spectroscopy. From scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we show that the local twist angles remarkably correlate with the characteristic local electronic properties. Most remarkably, the films spontaneously generate strained wrinkles during growth, with certain wrinkled regions exhibiting robust strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields, as recorded by ultra-low temperature STS.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional materials provide a rich platform to explore phenomena such as emerging electronic and excitonic states, strong light-matter coupling and new optoelectronic device concepts. The optical response of monolayers is entangled with the substrate on which they are grown or deposited on, often a two-dimensional material itself. Understanding how the properties of the two-dimensional monolayers can be tuned via the substrate is therefore essential. Here we employ angle-resolved reflectivity and photoluminescence spectroscopy on highly ordered molecular monolayers on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to systematically investigate the angle-dependent optical response as a function of the thickness of the hBN flake. We observe that light reflection and emission occur in a strongly directed fashion and that the direction of light reflection and emission is dictated by the hBN flake thickness. Transfer matrix simulations reproduce the experimental data and show that optical interference effects in hBN are at the origin of the angle-dependent optical properties. While our study focuses on molecular monolayers on hBN, our findings are general and relevant for any 2D material placed on top of a substrate. Our findings demonstrate the need to carefully choose substrate parameters for a given experimental geometry but also highlight opportunities in applications such as lighting technology where the direction of light emission can be controlled via substrate thickness.</p>

            <p>The real-space variation quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) are used to calculate the quasiparticle energy bands and the quasiparticle effective mass of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic two-dimensional uniform electron liquid (2D-UEL)\@. The many-body finite-size errors are minimized by performing simulations for three system sizes with the number of electrons $N=146$, 218, and 302 for paramagnetic and $N=151$ for ferromagnetic systems. We consider 2D-UEL to be within the metallic density range $1\leq r_s \leq 5$. The VMC and DMC results predict that the quasiparticle effective mass $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL at high density $r_s=1$ is very close to 1, suggesting that effective mass renormalization due to electron-electron interaction is negligible. We find that $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL obtained by the VMC and DMC methods increases by $r_s$ but with different slopes. Our VMC and DMC results for ferromagnetic 2D-UEL indicate that $m^*$ decreases rapidly by reducing the density due to the strong suppression of the electron-electron interaction.</p>

            <p>Electronic correlation effects on the structural properties of double-layer FeSe are studied using variation and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods. The Slater-Jastrow many-body wavefunction with two different forms for the homogeneous two-body pair-correlation term is used. The ground-state energy of the system is obtained at the thermodynamic limit using two different trial wave functions called JDFT and JSD. Only the Jastrow factor is fully optimized in the JDFT wave function, while the Slater determinant comes from the density functional approximation. In the JSD trial wave function, the Slater determinant and the Jastrow factor are fully optimized simultaneously. We calculated the VMC and DMC energies as a function of interlayer separation for two different in-plane iron-iron bond lengths. Our QMC results indicate that the optimized interlayer separation decreases with increasing iron-iron bond length, driven by stretch. We found that a three- to two-dimensional phase transition increases the electron-electron correlation effects and shifts the system from moderately correlated to strongly correlated. The value of correlation energy implies that the Hubbard $U$ value, which is widely used in DFT+U calculations, for two-dimensional FeSe is larger than its value in bulk.</p>

By applying localized tensile and compressive stress via an atomic force microscopy probe, p and n type conductance are simultaneously written into the designed area with sub-100-nm resolution, as verified by spatially resolved capacitance and photocurrent experiments. Density functional theory calculations reveal strain-driven shifts of donor and acceptor levels, as large as several hundreds of meV, linking mechanical stress to semiconductor doping. Fabricated strain-engineered junction efficiently rectifies the current flow and performs logic operations with stable dynamic response. This strain-driven approach enables spatially precise doping in van der Waals materials without degrading crystallinity, offering a versatile platform for nanoscale semiconductor devices.</p>

            <p>The magnetic anisotropy (MA) of Fe-based ferromagnetic thin films has been extensively studied for device applications. The examined material is a new Fe-based ferromagnetic thin film, bcc Fe$_{1-x}$As$_x$ (Fe-As) with the in-plane MA (IMA) grown on a GaAs (111)B substrate. The magnetic properties of the Fe-As thin film have been investigated by Xray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and magnetic circular dichroism in hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (MCD-HAXPES) to elucidate the role of As ions in the IMA. The XMCD spectra at the Fe $L_{2,3}$ edge and MCD-HAXPES spectra of the Fe 2$p$ core level exhibit ferromagnetic and metallic features like Fe metal. The XMCD at the As $L_{2,3}$ edge demonstrates that the As ions contribute to the ferromagnetism of bcc Fe-As through the hybridization between the Fe 3$d$ and As 4$p$ orbitals. The estimations of the magnetic moments of Fe using the XMCD sum rules have revealed that the orbital magnetic moment is isotropic and the magnetic dipole term is anisotropic. The anisotropy of the magnetic dipole term can be attributed to the anisotropic $p-d$ hybridization due to epitaxial strain, contributing to the IMA of bcc Fe-As. Our findings enlighten the mechanism of the MA of the non-magnetic ion-doped bcc Fe thin film, which can be applied to other magnetic 3$d$ transition metal thin films doped with non-magnetic elements.</p>

            <p>Topologically protected edge states with immunity against various disorders have been implemented in a variety of topological insulators. In this Letter, we reveal that Landau levels in aperiodic acoustic structures can be achieved under different pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs). The produced zero order Landau modes (ZOLMs) could transmit along the channels at the interior or exterior of the inhomogeneous array, which are separately termed as "bulk-transported states" (BTSs) and "edge-transported states" (ETSs). Distinct from conventional valley edge states, the ZOLMs show intriguing self-collimation feature. If a pseudoelectric field (PEF) is further included, the combination of a PMF and PEF can result in the formation of bulk or edge Landau rainbow, where Landau zero modes are distributed at various positions of the bulk or boundary of the sample at different frequencies. The synthetic-gauge-field-controlled topological states can enable fully control of robust transmission, and using the entire footprint of a topological lattice. Our findings not only profoundly advance the current understanding of topological phase matter but also offer new avenues for constructing topological acoustic devices.</p>

            <p>The generalized Faraday method can be used for computation of spin-motive force (SMF) within the unitary transformation approach. Meanwhile, the unitary transformation approach, which could be employed to obtain an effective collinear exchange interaction of non-collinear magnetic structures, cannot be used when the other parts of the Hamiltonian contain spin-dependent couplings. In the current study, the method of unitary transformation has been generalized to systems with spin-momentum coupling. In this way, the SMF at topological insulator surfaces has been computed analytically.</p>

            <p>The free surface of glassy polymers exhibits enhanced segmental dynamics compared to the bulk, forming a liquid-like layer that lowers the glass transition temperature (Tg) in nanometersized polymer samples. Recent studies have shown that immersing polymers in ionic liquids can suppress this enhanced surface dynamics. To investigate how ionic liquids influence polymer dynamics near the ionic-liquid-polymer interface, we measure the surface leveling of nanometersized stepped polystyrene films immersed in ionic liquids, and compared the results to the case of films in vacuum. Our results reveal that ionic liquids significantly slow the leveling process both above and below Tg. However, our results indicate that the liquid-like surface layer below Tg does exist in ionic liquids. Numerical solutions of the thin-film equation, incorporating appropriate boundary conditions, show that the surface mobility of PS films in ionic liquids can match that of PS films in vacuum. Thus, while ionic liquids alter the polymer flow process, they do not eliminate the dynamical heterogeneity inherent to glassy polymers.</p>

            <p>Self-assemblies, structured via nanoparticles, show promise as materials for advanced applications, like photonic devices, electrochemical energy storage units and catalysis support. Despite observing diverse morphologies, a comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we show that the coordination interaction between metal sulfide nanoparticles (MS NPs) and the fluorosurfactants at the droplet interface influences the morphology during the evaporation-induced self-assembly facilitated by droplet microfluidics. Further investigation into fluorosurfactants with various chemical groups and MS NPs reveals that the strength of coordination interactions significantly influences assembly morphology. The interfacial interactions can be eliminated through coating a SiO2 layer on the metal colloid (M@SiO2 NPs). In addition, we demonstrate that the morphologies of the self-assemblies can be engineered via the coordination interactions between the MS NPs and fluorosurfactants, and by varying the concentrations of MS NPs. Utilizing these interfacial interactions, assemblies with core-shell and homogeneous distribution of binary nanoparticles were constructed. Our findings offer novel insights into the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the droplet interface through evaporation-induced self-assembly, and into the design of metal colloidal assemblies with diverse morphologies, crucial for developing novel functional assemblies for catalysis, plasmonic, and porous materials in a controlled manner.</p>

            <h2>An Extension of the Adiabatic Theorem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarah Damerow, Stefan Kehrein</p>
            <p>We examine the validity of a potential extension of the adiabatic theorem to quantum quenches, i.e., non-adiabatic changes. In particular, the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) and the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Ising (ANNNI) model are studied. The proposed extension of the adiabatic theorem is stated as follows: Consider the overlap between the initial ground state and the post-quench Hamiltonian eigenstates for quenches within the same phase. This overlap is largest for the post-quench ground state. In the case of the TFIM, this conjecture is confirmed for both the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases numerically and analytically. In the ANNNI model, the conjecture could be analytically proven for a special case. Numerical methods were employed to investigate the conjecture's validity beyond this special case.</p>

            <p>A polymer shell offers a unique opportunity to tailor structural and optical properties of optically functional nanoparticles and their ensembles.

We show formation of a PNIPAM shell of controlled thickness from the change of the hydrodynamic diameter and study the effect of thermoresponsive shrinkage and expansion of the shell on the Mie resonance of a Si NS. We then demonstrate that Si NSs with PNIPAM shells enable fabrication of cluster-free, self-assembled monolayers of Si NSs, in which distances between NSs are controlled by the PNIPAM shell thickness.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit interaction accounts for the coupling of momentum and spin degrees of freedom of electrons and holes in semiconductor materials. In quantum information processing, it allows for electrical control of spin states and for the engineering of topologically protected Majorana zero modes. Although such functionalities were previously considered to be limited to semiconductor materials with strong intrinsic spin-orbit interactions only, recent theoretical work proposes using external rotating magnetic fields to engineer synthetic spin-orbit coupling. This would relax material constraints and open up new research directions for materials with low intrinsic spin-orbit interaction or augment existing spin-orbit interaction in materials in which this interaction is already strong. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and introduce rotating magnetic fields along an InAs/Al hybrid nanowire using permalloy micromagnet arrays which yields an estimated synthetic Rashba spin-orbit interaction coefficient of 0.022 eV nm. We use transport spectroscopy and the energy dependence of Andreev bound states in the nanowires as a probe of the magnetic field profiles of the micromagnets which are reconfigurably prepared in parallel or antiparallel magnetization configurations.</p>

For $T$=Mn an additional temperature scale of $\approx 47$~K has considerable impact on linewidth, resonance field and intensity.

            <p>The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature TC, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to inter-band scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multi-band superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by inter-band scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying elementary crystal defects in the form of stacking faults with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune inter-band coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multi-band superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.</p>

            <p>In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide structures, the optical excitation of a bright exciton may be followed by the formation of a plethora of lower energy dark states. In these formation and relaxation processes between different exciton species, non-equilibrium exciton and phonon populations play a dominant role, but remain so far largely unexplored as most states are inaccessible by regular spectroscopies. Here, on the example of homobilayer 2H-MoS$_2$, we realize direct access to the full exciton relaxation cascade from experiment and theory. By measuring the energy- and in-plane momentum-resolved photoemission spectral function, we reveal a distinct fingerprint for dark excitons in a non-equilibrium excitonic occupation distribution. In excellent agreement with microscopic many-particle calculations, we quantify the timescales for the formation of a non-equilibrium dark excitonic occupation and its subsequent thermalization to 85~fs and 150~fs, respectively. Our results provide a previously inaccessible view of the complete exciton relaxation cascade, which is of paramount importance for the future characterization of non-equilibrium excitonic phases and the efficient design of optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Murotani, Tomohiro Fujimoto, Ryusuke Matsunaga</p>
            <p>Helicity-dependent photocurrents perpendicular to a bias electric field have attracted considerable attention as an expression of optically controlled Berry curvature in Floquet engineering. More recent studies have revealed a larger contribution by the momentum asymmetry of photocarriers to this photovoltaic Hall effect, although its physical mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we describe this phenomenon as a circular photogalvanic effect caused by an electric field-induced Berry curvature. The shift vector provides an additional contribution through the energy shift of interband transitions. A resonant enhancement of the transverse photocurrent occurs in GaAs owing to the topological character of the valence band. Our results present a geometric picture of the third-order nonlinear response under light and bias fields, shedding new light on Berry curvature engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Kamarei, E. Breedlove, O. Lopez-Pamies</p>
            <p>At present, there is an abundance of results showing that the phase-field approach to fracture in elastic brittle materials -- when properly accounting for material strength -- describes the \emph{nucleation} of fracture from large pre-existing cracks in a manner that is consistent with the Griffith competition between bulk deformation energy and surface fracture energy. By contrast, results that demonstrate the ability of this approach to describe Griffith fracture \emph{propagation} are scarce and restricted to Mode I. Aimed at addressing this lacuna, the main objective of this paper is to show that the phase-field approach to fracture describes Mode III fracture propagation in a manner that is indeed consistent with the Griffith energy competition. This is accomplished via direct comparisons between phase-field predictions for fracture propagation in the so-called \emph{trousers} \emph{test} and the corresponding results that emerge from the Griffith energy competition. The latter are generated from full-field finite-element solutions that -- as an additional critical contribution of this paper -- also serve to bring to light the hitherto unexplored limitations of the classical Rivlin-Thomas-Greensmith formulas that are routinely used to analyze the trousers test.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the crystallization of a polar octafluoronaphthalene (OFN, \OFN)--phthalazine (Phth, \Phth) cocrystal, formed in a 1:2 ratio by slow evaporation. The crystal structure and vibrational properties of the cocrystal were determined using powder/single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and confirmed with density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations. The molecular $\pi$-stacking of aromatic rings is unconventional compared with other arene--perfluoroarene cocrystals. Phth molecules are offset and misaligned with respect to the major axis of OFN due to electrostatic repulsion between N and F atoms, enabling overall electric polarization attributed to the dipole moment of Phth. Our calculations show that OFN:2Phth is an insulator with a band gap of $\sim$2.4 eV. The electric polarization was calculated to be 7.1 \muC, while the shear piezoelectric coefficient ($d_{34}$) may be as large as 11.4 pC N$^{-1}$.</p>

            <p>Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), a two-dimensional (2D) layered ferromagnetic metal, exhibits a high Curie temperature (TC) ~ 360 K along with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), making it a promising material candidate for next-generation energy-efficient magnetic devices. However, the vast majority of studies on FGaT to date have been limited to millimeter-sized bulk crystals and exfoliated flakes, which are unsuitable for practical applications and integration into device processing. Also, its combination with other 2D materials to form van der Waals heterostructures has only been achieved by flake stacking. Consequently, the controlled large-scale growth of FGaT and related heterostructures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate a breakthrough in the high-quality, large-scale growth of epitaxial FGaT thin films on single-crystalline graphene/SiC templates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization confirms the high crystalline quality of the continuous FGaT/graphene van der Waals heterostructures. Temperature-dependent magnetization and anomalous Hall measurements reveal robust PMA with an enhanced TC well above room temperature, reaching up to 400 K. Furthermore, X-ray absorption and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra provide insight into the spin and orbital magnetic moment contributions, further validating the high TC and robust PMA. These findings are highly significant for the future development of high-performance spintronic devices based on 2D heterostructures, with potential applications in next-generation data storage, logic processing and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal ice ($\rm{I_h}$), the most common structure of ice, displays a variety of fascinating properties. Despite major efforts, a theoretical description of all its properties is still lacking. In particular, correctly accounting for its density and interatomic interactions is of utmost importance as a stepping stone for a deeper understanding of other properties. Deep potentials are a recent alternative to investigate the properties of {\iceIH}, which aims to match the accuracy of \textit{ab initio} simulations with the simplicity and scalability of classical molecular dynamics. This becomes particularly significant if one wishes to address nuclear quantum effects. In this work, we use machine learning potentials obtained for different exchange and correlation functionals to simulate the structural and vibrational properties of {\iceIH}. We show that most functionals overestimate the density of ice compared to experimental results. Furthermore, a quantum treatment of the nuclei leads to even further distancing from experiments. We understand this by highlighting how different inter-atomic interactions play a role in obtaining the equilibrium density. In particular, different from water clusters and bulk water, nuclear quantum effects lead to stronger H-bonds in {\iceIH}.</p>

            <p>Silica is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature, enabling their analysis at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La- APT). In this study, we show that UV and deep-UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</p>

            <p>The optical control of spin- and valley-selective gapless states in two-dimensional materials presents new opportunities for next-generation spintronic and valleytronic technologies. In this work, we study monolayer jacutingaite (Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$), a quantum spin Hall insulator with strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, under irradiation by circularly polarized light. The light-induced Floquet engineering gives rise to tunable topological phases, including transitions to spin- and valley-polarized semimetallic states. To probe these topological transitions, we employ the spin and orbital Edelstein effects -- non-equilibrium responses arising from spin-orbit interactions in systems lacking inversion symmetry -- without resorting to topological invariants such as Chern numbers. We identify universal signatures of the phase transitions encoded in the Edelstein response: a pronounced discontinuity in the spin Edelstein conductivity and a vanishing orbital Edelstein susceptibility mark the onset of the semimetallic regime. Furthermore, we investigate how the growth and suppression of the spin Edelstein responses across the topological phase transition depend on the interband scattering time. These findings establish the Edelstein effect as a sensitive and experimentally accessible probe of light-induced topological transitions in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Biomolecular condensates play a crucial role in the spatial organization of living matter. These membrane-less organelles, resulting from liquid-liquid phase separation, operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium, with their size and stability influenced by non-equilibrium chemical reactions. While condensates are frequently considered optimized nanoreactors that enhance molecular encounters, their actual impact on reaction kinetics remains unclear due to competing effects such as diffusion hindrance, and random trapping in non-specific condensates. In this study, we develop a microscopic, stochastic model for chemically active droplets, incorporating reaction-driven modulation of protein interactions. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how protein interactions and active coupling to a free energy reservoir influence phase separation, molecular transport and reaction kinetics. We demonstrate that the intensity of the chemical drive governs surface dynamics, generating fluxes that modulate bimolecular reaction rates. Comparing active emulsions to homogeneous systems, we reveal that condensates can either accelerate or decelerate molecular encounters. Our findings provide key insights into the role of biomolecular condensates as potential regulators of intracellular reaction kinetics.</p>

            <p>The characterization of ensembles of many-qubit random states and their realization via quantum circuits are crucial tasks in quantum-information theory. In this work, we study the ensembles generated by quantum circuits that randomly permute the computational basis, thus acting classically on the corresponding states. We focus on the averaged entanglement and present two main results. First, we derive generically tight upper bounds on the entanglement that can be generated by applying permutation circuits to arbitrary initial states. We show that the late-time ``entanglement Page curves'' are bounded in terms of the initial state participation entropies and its overlap with the ``maximally antilocalized'' state. Second, comparing the averaged Rényi-$2$ entropies generated by $(i)$ an infinitely deep random circuit of two-qubit gates and $(ii)$ global random permutations, we show that the two quantities are different for finite $N$ but the corresponding Page curves coincide in the thermodynamic limit. We also discuss how these conclusions are modified by additional random phases or considering circuits of $k$-local gates with $k\geq 3$. Our results are exact and highlight the implications of classical features on entanglement generation in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Machine learning (ML) models trained on Ising spin configurations have demonstrated surprising effectiveness in classifying phases of Potts models, even when processing severely reduced representations that retain only two spin states. To unravel this remarkable capability, we identify a family of novel alternative order parameters for the $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts models on a square lattice, constructed from the occupancies of secondary and minimal spin states rather than the conventional dominant-state order parameter. Through systematic finite-size scaling analyses, we demonstrate that these observables, including a magnetization-like observable derived from a reduced spin representation, accurately capture critical behavior, yielding critical temperatures and exponents consistent with established theoretical predictions and numerical benchmarks. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the fundamental relationships between these alternative order parameters, demonstrating how they collectively encode criticality through different aspects of spin configurations. Our results provide a thermodynamic basis for ML's success in reduced representations. This work bridges data-driven ML approaches with fundamental statistical mechanics, showing that criticality in Potts systems can be encoded in more compact, non-traditional forms, and opens avenues for discovering analogous order parameters in broader spin systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pius M. Theiler, Sander Driessen, Matthew C. Beard</p>
            <p>For over two decades, the role of structural chirality in spin polarization has been widely investigated, with implications for the origins of life, catalysis, and quantum phenomena. Yet, it remains unclear whether all chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effects arise from a common mechanism. We show that breaking all mirror symmetries in structurally chiral electron systems enforces a twin-pair electron exchange, inherently violating both parity P and time-reversal T symmetry while preserving combined PT-symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This exchange produces chiral quantum states where electron spin and motion are intrinsically linked, a key feature of CISS. At interfaces, these states drive spin and charge accumulation via spin-momentum locking. Our findings establish a new paradigm connecting quantum statistics, non-Hermitian physics, and spin transport with structural chirality. This framework unifies all observed CISS effects and provides guiding principles for designing chiral materials for spintronic and quantum applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiantian Zhang, Yizhou Liu, Hu Miao, Shuichi Murakami</p>
            <p>Phonons, the quantized vibrational modes of a crystal lattice, are ubiquitous quasiparticles in solid-state systems. They play a central role in a wide range of physical phenomena, from thermal transport, as primary carriers of heat in insulators, to their involvement in symmetry-breaking orders such as charge density waves and superconductivity. Traditionally considered as spinless bosons, phonons have recently emerged as a fertile ground for exploring topological physics, spurred by the rapid development of topological band theory initially formulated for fermionic systems. It is now understood that the phonon eigenstates, characterized by their eigenvalues and eigenvectors, can carry nontrivial topological invariants such as Berry curvature and Chern numbers, despite the absence of spin or charge. This new understanding opens up avenues to investigate the interplay between lattice dynamics, topology, and chirality in bosonic systems. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of recent theoretical and experimental advances in the field of topological and chiral phonons. We begin by introducing the foundational concepts, including the classification of phononic band structures, symmetry-protected topological phases, and the definition of topological invariants in bosonic systems. Special attention is given to the concept of phonon angular momentum and its fundametal connection to Weyl phonons in inversion-symmetry-breaking systems. We then discuss key experimental realizations of topological and chiral phonons across a variety of material platforms. Finally, we outline outstanding challenges and promising directions for future research, such as the role of topology in phonon-mediated quasiparticle interactions and the manipulation of phonon angular momentum in quantum technologies.</p>

A series of software packages have been developed and integrated into ProME v1.0, including ABC (AI-Based Crystal search) for crystal structure search under pressure, SAE (Similar Atomic Environment) for disordered configuration modeling, MFP$^2$ (Multiphase Fast Previewer by Mean-Field Potential) for multiphase thermodynamic properties, HTEM (High-throughput Toolkit for Elasticity Modeling) for thermo-elastic properties, TREX (TRansport at Extremes) for electrical and thermal conductivity, Hippos (High plastic phase model software) for phase-field simulation of microstructure evolution under high strain rates, and AutoCalphad for modeling and optimization of phase diagrams with variable compositions. ProME v1.0 has been applied to design the composition of the quaternary alloys Platinum-Iridium-Aluminum-Chromium (Pt-Ir-Al-Cr) for engine nozzles of aerospace attitude-orbit control, achieving high-temperature strength comparable to the currently used Pt-Ir alloys but with significantly reduced costs for raw materials. ProME offers crucial support for advancing both fundamental scientific understanding and industrial innovation in materials research and development.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linda Albanese, Adriano Barra, Emilio N. M. Cirillo</p>
            <p>In these short notes, we adapt and systematically apply Guerra's interpolation techniques on a class of disordered mean-field spin glasses equipped with crystal fields and multi-value spin variables. These models undergo the phenomenon of inverse melting or inverse freezing. In particular, we focus on the Ghatak-Sherrington model, its extension provided by Katayama and Horiguchi, and the disordered Blume-Emery-Griffiths-Capel model in the mean-field limit, deepened by Crisanti and Leuzzi and by Schupper and Shnerb. Once shown how all these models can be retrieved as particular limits of a unique broader Hamiltonian, we study their free energies. We provide explicit expressions of their annealed and quenched expectations, inspecting the cases of replica symmetry and (first-step) broken replica symmetry. We recover several results previously obtained via heuristic approaches (mainly the replica trick) to prove full agreement with the existing literature. As a sideline, we also inspect the onset of replica symmetry breaking by providing analytically the expression of the de Almeida-Thouless instability line for a replica symmetric description: in this general setting, the latter is new also from a physical viewpoint.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme Fiusa, Pedro E. Harunari, Abhaya S. Hegde, Gabriel T. Landi</p>
            <p>Understanding fluctuations of observables across stochastic trajectories is essential for various fields of research, from quantum thermal machines to biological motors. We introduce the notion of stochastic excursions as a framework to analyze sub-trajectories of processes far from equilibrium. Given a partition of state space in two phases, labeled active and inactive, an excursion starts with a transition into the active phase and ends upon returning to inactivity. By incorporating counting variables, our approach captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, providing insights on thermodynamic trade-offs between energy expenditure, entropy production and dynamical activity. As our main result, we uncover a fundamental relation between fluctuations of counting observables at the single-excursion level and the steady state noise obtained from full counting statistics. We also show the existence of an exchange-type fluctuation theorem at the level of individual excursions. As an application, we explore how analyzing excursions yields additional insights into the operation of the three-qubit absorption refrigerator.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Statistics and Electron Transfer at Topological Defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric R. Bittner</p>
            <p>We develop a theoretical framework for electron transfer (ET) at graphene defects, treating the surface as a Dirac cone with a localized defect state coupled to a vibrational environment. Using a polaron transformation combined with a modified density of states, we derive an explicit expression for the ET rate that incorporates both vibrational reorganization and fractionalized quasiparticle statistics. We show that fractional statistics, modeled through a power-law density of states, suppress low-energy ET near resonance and introduce tunable deviations from conventional Marcus-like kinetics. Our results suggest that strain, defect engineering, or chemical modification could stabilize fractional excitations in graphene-based catalysts, offering new strategies for controlling surface reactivity. These findings provide a foundation for future experimental and computational investigations into the role of topology and fractional statistics in chemical electron transfer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleg A. Goglichidze, Mikhail E. Gusakov</p>
            <p>The force acting on a proton vortex in extreme type-II superconducting neutron star matter is studied in the limit of vanishing temperature. A detailed analysis is presented on how momentum is transferred from length scales on the order of the London penetration depth to the vortex core. To examine the momentum flux, expressions for proton and electron currents are derived for arbitrary distances from the vortex line. It is shown that, in the regime of a large electron mean free path, the only force acting directly on the vortex core is the Magnus force. Notably, the correction to the proton current near the vortex core generates a component of the Magnus force aligned with the incident current measured far from the vortex. This contribution, responsible for longitudinal force, is usually overlooked in the literature. The results obtained in this work for a relatively simple problem concerning the force on a vortex in cold matter of neutron stars may also be relevant to other superconducting systems.</p>

            <p>Field Effect Transistors (FETs) are ubiquitous in electronics. As we scale FETs to ever smaller sizes, it becomes natural to ask how small a practical FET might be. We propose and analyze an atomically precise molecular FET (herein referred to as an "mFET") with 7,694 atoms made only of hydrogen and carbon atoms. It uses metallic (4,4) carbon nanotubes as the conductive leads, a linear segment of Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond) as the channel, Lonsdaleite as the insulating layer between the channel and the gate, and a (20,20) metallic carbon nanotube as the surrounding gate. The (4,4) nanotube leads are bonded to the channel using a mix of 5- and 6-membered rings, and to the gate using 5-, 6- and 7-membered rings. Issues of component design assessment and optimization using quantum chemical methods are discussed throughout. A 10 watt sugar-cube-sized computer made with $10^{18}$ such mFETs could deliver $\sim 10^{25}$ switching operations per second.</p>

            <h2>Self-reorganization and Information Transfer in Massive Schools of Fish</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haotian Hang, Chenchen Huang, Alex Barnett, Eva Kanso</p>
            <p>The remarkable cohesion and coordination observed in moving animal groups and their collective responsiveness to threats are thought to be mediated by scale-free correlations, where changes in the behavior of one animal influence others in the group, regardless of the distance between them. But are these features independent of group size? Here, we investigate group cohesiveness and collective responsiveness in computational models of massive schools of fish of up to 50,000 individuals. We show that as the number of swimmers increases, flow interactions destabilize the school, creating clusters that constantly fragment, disperse, and regroup, similar to their biological counterparts. We calculate the spatial correlation and speed of information propagation in these dynamic clusters. Spatial correlations in cohesive and polarized clusters are indeed scale free, much like in natural animal groups, but fragmentation events are preceded by a decrease in correlation length, thus diminishing the group's collective responsiveness, leaving it more vulnerable to predation events. Importantly, in groups undergoing collective turns, the information about the change in direction propagates linearly in time among group members, thanks to the non-reciprocal nature of the visual interactions between individuals. Merging speeds up the transfer of information within each cluster by several fold, while fragmentation slows it down. Our findings suggest that flow interactions may have played an important role in group size regulation, behavioral adaptations, and dispersion in living animal groups.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo Watanabe, Hidetaka Manabe, Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda</p>
            <p>We have developed TTNOpt, a software package that utilizes tree tensor networks (TTNs) for quantum spin systems and high-dimensional data analysis. TTNOpt provides efficient and powerful TTN computations by locally optimizing the network structure, guided by the entanglement pattern of the target tensors. For quantum spin systems, TTNOpt searches for the ground state of Hamiltonians with bilinear spin interactions and magnetic fields, and computes physical properties of these states, including the variational energy, bipartite entanglement entropy (EE), single-site expectation values, and two-site correlation functions. Additionally, TTNOpt can target the lowest-energy state within a specified subspace, provided that the Hamiltonian conserves total magnetization. For high-dimensional data analysis, TTNOpt factorizes complex tensors into TTN states that maximize fidelity to the original tensors by optimizing the tensors and the network. When a TTN is provided as input, TTNOpt reconstructs the network based on the EE without referencing the fidelity of the original state. We present three demonstrations of TTNOpt: (1) Ground-state search for the hierarchical chain model with a system size of $256$. The entanglement patterns of the ground state manifest themselves in a tree structure, and TTNOpt successfully identifies the tree. (2) Factorization of a quantic tensor of the $2^{24}$ dimensions representing a three-variable function where each variant has a weak bit-wise correlation. The optimized TTN shows that its structure isolates the variables from each other. (3) Reconstruction of the matrix product network representing a $16$-variable normal distribution characterized by a tree-like correlation structure. TTNOpt can reveal hidden correlation structures of the covariance matrix.</p>

            <h2>Indirect Influence on Network Diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lluís Torres-Hugas, Jordi Duch, Sergio Gómez</p>
            <p>Models of network diffusion typically rely on the Laplacian matrix, capturing interactions via direct connections. Beyond direct interactions, information in many systems can also flow via indirect pathways, where influence typically diminishes over distance. In this work, we analyze diffusion dynamics incorporating such indirect connections using the $d$-path Laplacian framework. We introduce a parameter, the indirect influence, based on the change in the second smallest eigenvalue of the generalized path Laplacian, to quantify the impact of these pathways on diffusion timescales relative to direct-only models. Using perturbation theory and mean-field approximations, we derive analytical expressions for the indirect influence in terms of structural properties of random networks. Theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations, providing a phase diagram for when indirect influence becomes significant. We also identify a structural phase transition governed by the emergence of $d$-paths and derive the critical connection probability above which they dramatically alter diffusion. This study provides a quantitative understanding of how indirect pathways shape network dynamics and reveals their collective structural onset.</p>

            <p>Ideal effective parity-time (PT)-symmetry can be achieved in a passive open system by accurately balancing feeding and absorption processes. Such PT-symmetric systems display Hermitian subspaces which enable perfect absorption (PA) of radiation, i.e., all the incoming energy is absorbed by the system. In this work, we consider a passive open quantum system obtained by coupling molecular spin centers to a planar microwave resonator operating at milliKelvin temperatures and at few-photon power level. We experimentally demonstrate that Hermitian subspaces and thus PA can be implemented even in the absence of PT-symmetry, by exploiting the spin detuning to control the photon and spin content of a polariton mode. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and significantly enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how Hermitian subspaces can be potentially exploited for the development of efficient switches and modulators with high modulation depths over a broad spectral range.</p>

            <p>Narrowband emission is crucial for next generation optoelectronic devices to satisfy demands for high color brilliance. Microcavities can narrow emission spectra of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) through the creation of resonant standing waves, independent of emitter material, enabling flexibility in molecular and device design. However, they induce a strong angle-dependence of the perceived emission color. Utilizing strong light-matter coupling of cavity photons with the virtually angle-independent exciton, leads to exciton-polariton emission showing reduced linewidths and suppressed angular dispersion if tuned correctly. Creating polaritons in highly efficient materials such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is however difficult as their low oscillator strengths intrinsically disfavor light-matter interaction. Here, we present the successful combination of a highly efficient but intrinsically broadband TADF emitter with a strongly absorbing assistant strong coupling material in a modified microcavity structure. Through optimizing the assistant strong coupling layer architecture, we demonstrate polariton OLEDs with exceptionally narrowband, angle stable emission at external quantum efficiencies above 20% for both bottom- and top-emitting designs, more than doubling the performance of previous record devices. The results pave the way for utilizing polaritonic emission at practical device efficiencies for display applications.</p>

            <h2>Representation of tensor functions using low-order structural tensor set: two-dimensional point group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Madadi, Lin Cheng, Pu Zhang</p>
            <p>The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc.</p>

            <h2>Optimal statistical ensembles for quantum thermal state preparation within the quantum singular value transformation framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasushi Yoneta</p>
            <p>Preparing thermal equilibrium states is an essential task for finite-temperature quantum simulations. In statistical mechanics, microstates in thermal equilibrium can be obtained from statistical ensembles. To date, a variety of ensembles have been devised, including not only the Gibbs ensembles, such as the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, but also various generalized ensembles. Since these ensembles yield equivalent thermodynamic predictions, one can freely choose an ensemble for computational convenience. In this paper, we exploit this flexibility to develop an efficient quantum algorithm for preparing thermal equilibrium states. We first present a quantum algorithm for implementing generalized ensembles within the framework of quantum singular value transformation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the computational cost and elucidate its dependence on the choice of the ensemble. We show that selecting an appropriate ensemble can significantly mitigate ensemble-dependent overhead and yield improved scaling of the computational cost with system size compared to existing methods based on the canonical ensemble. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost even for finite-size systems. Our algorithm applies to arbitrary thermodynamic systems at any temperature and is thus expected to offer a practical and versatile method for computing finite-temperature properties of quantum many-body systems. These results highlight the potential of ensemble design as a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency of a broad class of quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teng Xiao, Gentaro Watanabe</p>
            <p>We examine a standard scheme to obtain the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) from the Lindblad master equation by neglecting its jump term, and propose an alternative approach to address the limitations of the former. It is shown that the NHH obtained by the conventional scheme fails to provide a good approximation for fermionic many-body systems, even on short timescales. To resolve this issue, we present a framework called the local NHH formalism, which describes the loss process in each individual mode locally. This formalism is applicable to general dissipative fermionic systems and remains consistent with the underlying Lindblad master equation at the level of the equations of motion of local observables. The local NHH formalism also provides a convenient framework for studying non-Hermitian physics in dissipative fermionic systems, especially for spectral analysis, compared to the Lindblad master equation. As an illustration, we consider a fermionic superfluid subjected to one-body loss and find the population increase induced by the loss, resulting from the locking of the relative phase between the pairing gap and the anomalous field. The conventional NHH fails to capture these unique phenomena.</p>

            <p>The formation of two-band nodal points in gapless topological phases, referred to as conventional Weyl nodes, relies solely on translational symmetry. However, when coupled with other spatial and spatio-temporal symmetries, unconventional Weyl nodes with high degeneracy, pronounced chirality, and complementary quaternion charges can manifest. In this work, we identify ReO3 as an ideal unconventional Weyl semimetal in which rotation and screw symmetries as well as their combination with time-reversal symmetry play a crucial role. To show this, we first revisit in detail the algebraic determination of the chirality of Weyl nodes from the spinful irreducible representations of the occupied and unoccupied bands, and then combine it with the complementary C2T-symmetry-protected patch Euler class and non-Abelian frame charges that indicates the pinning of the Weyl nodes on C2T-invariant planes. Supporting our findings with first-principles calculations, we furthermore reveal very clear Fermi arc signatures of the high-chirality Weyl nodes at the Fermi level for different surface orientations. We finally investigate the effect of strain upon which the robustness of Weyl nodes clearly demonstrates their Chern (i.e. chirality conservation) and quaternionic (i.e. symmetry-plane pinning) topological nature.</p>

            <p>Automated detection of grain boundaries in electron microscope images of polycrystalline materials could help accelerate the nanoscale characterization of myriad engineering materials and novel materials under scientific research. Accurate segmentation of interconnected line networks, such as grain boundaries in polycrystalline material microstructures, poses a significant challenge due to the fragmented masks produced by conventional computer vision algorithms, including convolutional neural networks. These algorithms struggle with thin masks, often necessitating post-processing for effective contour closure and continuity. Previous approaches in this domain have typically relied on custom post-processing techniques that are problem-specific and heavily dependent on the quality of the mask obtained from a computer vision algorithm. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a fast, high-fidelity post-processing technique that is universally applicable to segmentation masks of interconnected line networks. Leveraging domain knowledge about grain boundary connectivity, this method employs conditional random fields and perceptual grouping rules to refine segmentation masks of any image with a discernible grain structure. This approach significantly enhances segmentation mask accuracy, achieving a 79% segment identification accuracy in validation with a U-Net model on electron microscopy images of a polycrystalline oxide. Additionally, a novel grain alignment metric is introduced, showing a 51% improvement in grain alignment. This method not only enables rapid and accurate segmentation but also facilitates an unprecedented level of data analysis, significantly improving the statistical representation of grain boundary networks, making it suitable for a range of disciplines where precise segmentation of interconnected line networks is essential.</p>

Specifically, we unveil the underlying dynamical system describing the spatial distribution of zero modes and show the emergence of chaos. We also propose the correspondence between the absolute value of the topological invariant and the dimension of the stable manifold under sufficiently weak nonlinearity. Our results provide a general guiding principle to investigate the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence that can potentially be extended to arbitrary dimensions.</p>

            <p>We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Using techniques from stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate. This relation can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models with different noise schedules and different data. We numerically discuss our results for optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also demonstrate the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.</p>

            <p>Many-body eigenstates that are neither thermal nor many-body-localized (MBL) were numerically found in certain interacting chains with moderate quasiperiodic potentials. The energy regime consisting of these non-ergodic but extended (NEE) eigenstates has been extensively studied for being a possible many-body mobility edge between the energy-resolved MBL and thermal phases. Recently, the NEE regime was further proposed to be a prethermal phenomenon that generally occurs when different operators spread at sizably different timescales. Here, we numerically examine the mutual independence among the NEE, MBL, and thermal regimes in the lens of eigenstate entanglement spectra (ES). Given the complexity and rich information embedded in ES, we develop an unsupervised learning approach that is designed to quantify the mutual independence among general phases. Our method is first demonstrated on an illustrative toy example that uses RGB color data to represent phases, then applied to the ES of an interacting generalized Aubry Andre model from weak to strong potential strength. We find that while the MBL and thermal regimes are mutually independent, the NEE regime is dependent on the former two and smoothly appears as the potential strength decreases. We attribute our numerically finding to the fact that the ES data in the NEE regime exhibits both an MBL-like fast decay and a thermal-like long tail.</p>

            <p>We investigate the locomotion of thin, living T. tubifex worms, which display active polymerlike behavior, within quasi-2D arrays of cylindrical pillars, examining varying spatial arrangements and densities. These active worms spread in crowded environments, with a dynamics dependent on both the concentration and arrangement of obstacles. In contrast to passive polymers, our results reveal that in disordered configurations, increasing the pillar density enhances the long-time diffusion of our active polymer-like worms, while we observe the opposite trend in ordered pillar arrays. We found that in disordered media, living worms reptate through available curvilinear tubes, whereas they become trapped within pores of ordered media. Intriguingly, we show that reducing the worm's activity significantly boosts its spread, enabling passive sorting of worms by activity level. Our experimental observations are corroborated through simulations of the tangentially driven polymer model with matched persistence length predicting the same trends.</p>

            <p>There are no clean samples in nature. Therefore, when we come to discuss the entanglement properties of quantum materials, the effects of disorder must be taken into account. This question is of particular interest for high-entangled phases, such as quantum spin liquids, which lie outside the Landau paradigm for classifying phases of matter. In this work, we explore what experimentally-accessible measures, in the form of concurrence, residual tangle and quantum Fisher information, can teach us about the entanglement in the presence of disorder. As a representative example, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLL) and disorder-driven random singlet (RS) phases found in antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. Using quantum Fisher information and residual tangle, we demonstrate that both TLL and RS phases exhibit multi-partite entanglement. In the case of the RS phase, we attribute this to entanglement localized below a crossover length scale. We further show that the order of disorder average matters in calculating measures like concurrence, and that this can lead to false inferences when interpreting experiment. Nonetheless, correctly interpreted, these witnesses provide useful information about the effects of disorder. We explore how information about the central charge of the TLL can be extracted from the low-temperature behavior of concurrence, and conjecture that this analysis can be extended to the effective central charge of the RS phase. Finally, we establish how RS and TLL phases can be distinguished through the growth of multi-partite entanglement, as witnessed by the equal-time structure factor. These results establish that, used carefully, experiments based on entanglement witnesses can provide important information about quantum spin systems in the presence of disorder.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Doppler effect in superfluid and supersolid atomic gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomasz Zawiślak, Marija Šindik, Sandro Stringari, Alessio Recati</p>
            <p>By employing the formalism of hydrodynamics, we derive novel analytic predictions for the Doppler effect in superfluids with broken Galilean invariance and hosting persistent currents at zero temperature. We consider two scenarios: when Galilean invariance is broken explicitly (by external potentials) and spontaneously, as it happens in a supersolid. In the former case, the presence of a stationary current affects the propagation of sound via an anomalous Doppler term proportional to the density derivative of the superfluid fraction. In supersolids, where, according to Goldstone theorem, distinct sounds of hybrid superfluid and crystal nature can propagate, the Doppler effect can be very different for each sound. Quantitative estimates of the Doppler shifts are obtained for Bose-Einstein condensed atomic gases, described by Gross-Pitaevskii theory. The estimates are obtained both calculating the thermodynamic parameters entering the hydrodynamic results, and from full time-dependent simulations.</p>

            <h2>Radiative Higgs mode in photoinduced $η$ pairs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satoshi Ejima, Benedikt Fauseweh</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the $\eta$ symmetry of the pump-induced $\eta$-pairing state in the Hubbard chain can be transiently broken by an additionally applied probe pulse. This leads to characteristic dynamic Higgs oscillations of the $\eta$-pair correlations during the probe pulse and a sharp dynamic negative optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega;t)$, which appears above the equilibrium Mott gap $\omega>\Delta_{\rm c}$, long after the pump pulse is finished. This negative peak in the real part of $\sigma(\omega;t)$ is a distinctive hallmark of the photoinduced $\eta$-pairing state, distinguishing it from phases dominated by incoherent doublon formation, which do not exhibit this feature. Remarkably the broadband probe pulse then leads to the emission of photons with the Higgs frequency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumaita Sultana, Golam Ali Sekh</p>
            <p>We consider matter-wave bright solitons in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices with a view to study Josephson-type oscillation and self-trapping of population imbalance between two pseudo-spin states. For fixed values of nonlinear interaction and lattice parameters, the population imbalance executes Josephson-type oscillation and the frequency of oscillation decreases with the increase of helicoidal gauge potential. The frequency of oscillation, however, increases in presence of nonlinear optical lattices. We find that the population imbalance can oscillate about a non-zero value and result self-trapping for proper choices of parameters of the system. The self-trapping can be enhanced by the increase of helicoidal gauge potential and by properly tuning the lattice parameters.</p>

Assuming rigid magnetic configurations, we show that this coupling results in an effective mass of the antiferromagnetic skyrmion and that its dynamics can be viewed as due to a relative displacement of the two sublattice ferromagnetic skyrmions. The theory holds for different antiferromagnetic systems and includes effects from dissipation and external forces caused by electric currents.

            <p>We study the emerging collective states in a simple mechanical model of a dense group of self-propelled polar disks with off-centered rotation, confined within a circular arena. Each disk presents self-alignment towards the sum of contact forces acting on it, resulting from disk-substrate interactions, while also displaying mutual alignment with neighbors due to having its center of rotation located a distance R behind its centroid so that central contact forces can also introduce torques. The effect of both alignment mechanisms produces a variety of collective states that combine high-frequency localized circular oscillations with low-frequency milling around the center of the arena, in fluid or solid regimes. We consider cases with small/large R values, isotropic/anisotropic disk-substrate damping, smooth/rough arena boundaries, different densities, and multiple systems sizes, showing that the emergent collective states that we identify are robust, generic, and potentially observable in real-world natural or artificial systems.</p>

            <p>To discover novel materials with high performance, there have been many attempts to adopt Bayesian optimization (BO) to materials science, owing to its efficiency in navigating complex and high-dimensional design spaces. However, the application of BO to material design has been suffered from handling discrete input variables, such as elements. Here, we introduce a novel element mapping strategy that encodes elemental identities into chemically meaningful continuous values, enabling to create easy-to-predict chemical spaces. We apply this new framework to design high capacity Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, targeting that shift all working voltages into the desired operational voltage window. The proposed framework successfully suggests 16 optimal element composition within 50 iterations. Our results demonstrate the way to overcome the limitation of categorical input that will likely broaden the applicability of BO to a wider range of material discoveries.</p>

            <p>We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point coinciding with the graph symmetry phase transition, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with average degrees diverging logarithmically with the network size. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanan Dery, Cedric Robert, Scott A. Crooker, Xavier Marie, Dinh Van Tuan</p>
            <p>Tuning the density of resident electrons or holes in semiconductors provides crucial insight into the composition of excitonic complexes that are observed as absorption or photoluminescence resonances in optical studies. Moreover, we can change the way these resonances shift and broaden in energy by controlling the quantum numbers of the resident carriers with magnetic fields and doping levels, and by selecting the quantum numbers of the photoexcited or recombining electron-hole (e-h) pair through optical polarization. We discuss the roles of distinguishability and optimality of excitonic complexes, showing them to be key ingredients that determine the energy shifts and broadening of optical resonances in charge-tunable semiconductors. A distinguishable e-h pair means that the electron and hole undergoing photoexcitation or recombination have quantum numbers that are not shared by any of the resident carriers. An optimal excitonic complex refers to a complex whose particles come with all available quantum numbers of the resident carriers. All optical resonances may be classified as either distinct or indistinct depending on the distinguishability of the e-h pair, and the underlying excitonic complex can be classified as either optimal or suboptimal. The universality of these classifications, inherited from the fundamental Pauli exclusion principle, allows us to understand how optical resonances shift in energy and whether they should broaden as doping is increased. This understanding is supported by conclusive evidence that the decay of optical resonances cannot be simply attributed to enhanced screening when resident carriers are added to a semiconductor. Finally, applying the classification scheme in either monolayer or moire heterobilayer systems, we relate the energy shift and amplitude of the neutral exciton resonance to the compressibility of the resident carrier gas.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Václav Janiš</p>
            <p>Electrons at the Fermi energy may lose their ability to propagate to long distances in certain random media. We use Green functions and solve parquet equations for the non-local electron-hole vertex in high spatial dimensions to describe the vanishing of diffusion in Anderson localization. It is caused by forming a quantum bound state between the diffusing particle and the hole left behind. Divergence in a new time scale proportional to the electrical polarizability signals the Anderson localization transition. Consequently, the height of the peak of the dynamical conductivity at zero frequency, the static diffusion constant, is not pushed to zero at the localization transition but rather its width. Spatially localized quantum bound states in the localized phase cannot be described by the continuity and wave equations in the Hilbert space of Bloch waves.</p>

            <p>The fascinating quantum many-body states in twisted bilayber graphene (TBG) at magic angle, due to the interplay of Coulomb interactions and the quantum metrics of flat bands, have been well understood both experimentally and theoretically. However, the phase diagram and excitations as functions of twist angle and permittivity are still largely unknown. Here, via a newly developed momentum-space continuous-field quantum Monte Carlo method fully taking into account long-ranged Coulomb interactions and flat bands' quantum metrics with system sizes that were not accessible before, we show that charge-neutral TBG realizes an angle-tuned quantum phase transition from a gapped Kramers intervalley coherence (KIVC) state to a Dirac semimetal with critical angles around 1.2$°$. In single-particle spectra we demonstrate the evolution of a minimum gap at $\Gamma$ at the magic angle and towards touching points at Brillouin zone corners as the angle increases. The free energy and KIVC order parameter show that the transition belongs to fermionic Gross-Neveu criticality, and is robust upon varying the permittivity or the interlayer hopping.</p>

To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism and develop a variety of tools to understand localisation in this setting.

We also employ a propagation matrix approach to prove a Saxon-Hutner type theorem ensuring the existence of band gaps for disordered systems and to predict the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. We further investigate the stabilities of bandgaps and localised eigenmodes with respect to fluctuations in the system by introducing a method of defect mode prediction based on the discrete Green function and illuminating the phenomena of Anderson localisation and level repulsion under global disorder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Marini</p>
            <p>The dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex is caused by the retarded oscillations of the electronic charge following the electron--hole scattering with a phonon mode. This retardation induces a frequency dependence of the electron--phonon interaction. Model Hamiltonians and {\em ab--initio} approaches have instilled the idea that this retardation is, in most of the cases, negligible. In this work I demonstrate that the dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex cannot be neglected {\em a priori}. By using a perturbative expansion I introduce a controllable and physically sound method to evaluate and include dynamical screening effects. Based on the exact results of the homogeneous electron gas I propose a dynamical vertex correction function $\Gamma_{e-p}(\omega)$ designed to screen the commonly used adiabatic electron--phonon interaction. This function is expressed in terms of adiabatic quantities, that can be easily calculated and used to evaluate the strength of the dynamical corrections, even in realistic materials.</p>

The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.</p>

            <p>In-plane semiconductor nanowires with complex branched geometries, prepared via selective area growth (SAG), offer a versatile platform for advanced electronics, optoelectronics, and quantum devices. However, defects and disorder at the interfaces and top surfaces of the nanowires can significantly degrade their electrical properties. One effective method to mitigate these issues is the incorporation of buffer and capping layers. In this work, we achieved a wider growth selectivity window of InGaAs in the presence of atomic hydrogen (H) and employed it as buffer and capping layers for SAG InAs nanowires to enhance their electrical properties. Hall measurements on InAs nanowires, with and without InGaAs buffer and/or capping layers, revealed that incorporating closely lattice-matched InGaAs buffer and capping layers to InAs nanowires nearly tripled the electron mobility and doubled the phase coherence length compared to nanowires without these layers. These findings demonstrate that the use of InGaAs buffer and capping layers is a crucial strategy for significantly enhancing the quality of InAs nanowires, unlocking their full potential for high performance electronics and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moiré graphene.</p>

            <p>In Szilard's engine, a demon measures a one-particle gas and applies feedback to extract work from thermal fluctuations, embodying Maxwell's notion that information reduces thermodynamic entropy - an apparent second-law violation. The Landauer-Bennett Thesis resolves this paradox by requiring the demon to record the measurement, which results in an entropy increase in the demon's memory. Eventually, the demon's memory needs to be erased. The erasure costs the same work as extracted previously, hence there is no violation of the second law. Though widely accepted, the fictitious memory invoked in the thesis has drawn multiple criticisms, with debates persisting over the demon's necessity. We show that the demon is the piston that partitions the space and drives the expansion. The final position of the piston after expansion records the particle's position pre-expansion: it is an ``information-bearing degree of freedom''. In this Piston-Demon Thesis, memory register and feedback (expansion) happen simultaneously. Our exposition identifies the mischievous demon as a physical degree of freedom, and greatly simplifies Szilard's engine. It also offers educators a tangible illustration of information-thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires exposed to a time-varying magnetic field at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experimental measurements, which demonstrates the synchronized ramped-down temperature can indeed fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying physical mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized ramped-down temperature can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we carry out numerical simulations for the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm with home-made codes. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the ramped-down temperature can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable this http URL findings offer a robust method to stabilize diverse superconducting magnet systems (including 2nd-gen coated tape HTS magnets), and propose a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with far-reaching implications for transport, topology, and sensing. While recent works have uncovered the NHSE in magnetic systems, these analyses rely on effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, thereby leaving open critical questions regarding their applicability and predictive power in experimentally feasible platforms. Here, we address this gap by exploring both the non-Hermitian and Liouvillian dynamics of a spin chain coupled to a shared bosonic reservoir. We identify the parameter regime in which these frameworks yield congruent predictions, while showing that the non-Hermitian approach fails to capture essential dynamical features -- such as relevant timescales and conditions for experimental observability. Our analysis also reveals that the NHSE stems from the interplay between chiral spin couplings and reciprocal nonlocal dissipation -- two interactions that can naturally occur in magnetic crystals and be easily engineered in magnetic heterostructures. Focusing on a concrete example of such heterostructures, we establish an explicit connection between their Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) dynamics and our microscopic model, providing a tangible route toward realizing the NHSE in an experimentally relevant spintronics setup.</p>

            <p>The quest to discover new 3D CFTs has been intriguing for physicists. For this purpose, fuzzy sphere reguarlisation that studies interacting quantum systems defined on the lowest Landau level on a sphere has emerged as a powerful tool. In this paper, we discover a series of new CFTs with global symmetry $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ in the fuzzy sphere models that are closely related to the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ deconfined phase transition, and are described by a $\mathrm{Sp}(N)/(\mathrm{Sp}(M)\times \mathrm{Sp}(N-M))$ non-linear sigma model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. We numerically verify the emergent conformal symmetry by observing the integer-spaced conformal multiplets and studying the finite-size scaling of the conformality. We discuss possible candidates for these newly discovered CFTs, the most plausible ones being Chern-Simons-matter theories which have $N$ flavour of gapless bosons or fermions coupled to a non-Abelian (viz. $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(2)$, etc.) Chern-Simons gauge field. Our work provides new avenues for studying interacting CFTs in 3D, possibly facilitating the non-perturbative study of critical gauge theories and previously undiscovered CFTs.</p>

For Poissonian resets, we compute the stationary state of the process and demonstrate, by taking a weak-reset limit, the existence of "resonances" in the quantum gates, allowing for the emergence of steady state density matrices which are not diagonal in the eigenbasis of the generator of the unitary gate. Such resonances are a genuine discrete-time feature and impact on quantum and classical correlations even beyond the weak-reset limit. Furthermore, we consider non-Poissonian reset processes and explore conditions for the existence of a steady state. We show that, when the reset probability vanishes sufficiently rapidly with time, the system does not approach a steady state. Our results highlight key differences between continuous-time and discrete-time stochastic resetting and may be useful to engineer states with controllable correlations on existing devices.</p>

            <p>We propose and test a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-Pérot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz. These results show no evident influence of atomic two-level systems in the cavity.</p>

            <p>We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</p>

            <p>Diamond's unique physical properties make it a versatile materials for a wide range of nonlinear and quantum photonic technologies. However, unlocking diamond's full potential as a nonlinear photonic material with non-zero second-order susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}\neq0$ requires symmetry breaking. In this work, we use a nanoscale cavity to demonstrate second-harmonic generation (SHG) in diamond, and demonstrate, for the first time, that the magnitude of the diamond's effective $\chi^{(2)}$ strongly depends on the electronic configuration of defects in the diamond crystal, such as nitrogen vacancy centres. The modification of $\chi^{(2)}$ arises from photoionisation from the negative to neutral charge state, and is manifested by quenching of SHG upon green illumination. Toggling the green illumination allows for optical switching of the device's $\chi^{(2)}$. Optical control of $\chi^{(2)}$ by defect engineering opens the door for second-order nonlinear processes in diamond.</p>

            <p>Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing Su, Jian-Jian Cheng, Lin Zhang</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic diversity associated with superradiant phase transitions within a one-dimensional tight-binding electronic chain that is intrinsically coupled to a single-mode optical cavity. By employing the quantized electromagnetic vector potential through the Peierls substitution, the gauge-invariant coupled Bose-Fermi system facilitates momentum-dependent superradiant transitions and effectively avoids the second-order spurious phase transitions typically observed in Dicke-like models. The quantum phase transitions in this system are characterized by stable dynamics, including the displacement and squeezing of the cavity mode and the redistribution of electronic momentum in the solid chain. Distinct from multimode cavity QED systems with atomic gases, this single-mode optical configuration unveils a range of nonlinear phenomena, including multistability and diversity of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The setup allows for precise manipulation of superradiant phases in the weak coupling regime, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of quantum fluctuation divergences. The diverse attributes of these quantum phase transitions enhance our understanding of tunable quantum solid devices and underscore their potential applications in quantum information processing and metrology.</p>

            <h2>Classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Bols, Wojciech De Roeck, Michiel De Wilde, Bruno de O. Carvalho</p>
            <p>We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}, which allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalence classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmetries provides an isomorphism between the group of stable equivalence classes of symmetries with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1))$, consistent with previous conjectures. This amounts to a complete classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains. We further show that a locality preserving symmetry is stably equivalent to one that can be presented by finite depth quantum circuits with covariant gates if and only if the slant product of its anomaly is trivial in $H^2(G, U(1)[G])$.</p>

            <p>We use a support vector regressor based on a projected quantum kernel method to predict the density structure of 1D fermionic systems of interest in quantum chemistry and quantum matter. The kernel is built on with the observables of a quantum reservoir implementable with interacting Rydberg atoms. Training and test data of the fermionic system are generated using a Density Functional Theory approach. We test the performance of the method for several Hamiltonian parameters, finding a general common behavior of the error as a function of measurement time. At sufficiently large measurement times, we find that the method outperforms the classical linear kernel method and can be competitive with the radial basis function method.</p>

            <h2>Quantum critical scaling of altermagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sondre Duna Lundemo, Flavio S. Nogueira, Asle Sudbø</p>
            <p>The term altermagnetism has recently been introduced to describe the Néel order of a class of materials whose magnetic sublattices are neither related by translation nor inversion. While these materials arguably have large technological potential, little effort has been devoted to studying the universal distinction of this phase of matter compared to collinear antiferromagnetism. Employing a recently proposed minimal microscopic model, we explicitly derive a nonlinear sigma model describing long-wavelength fluctuations of the staggered magnetization in this system, including quantum effects to leading order. The term that distinguishes the altermagnetic nonlinear sigma model from its antiferromagnetic counterpart is an interaction term that derives directly from the Berry phase of the microscopic spin degrees of freedom. Its effects on the one-loop renormalization group flow in $d=2+\epsilon$ dimensions are examined. Extending the theory to describe the fermionic excitations of the metallic altermagnet, we find an effective low-energy model of $d$-wave spin-split Dirac fermions interacting with the magnetic fluctuations. Using a Dyson-Schwinger approach, we derive the many-body effects on the dynamical critical scaling due to the competition between the long-range Coulomb interaction and the fluctuations of the staggered magnetization.</p>

            <h2>Electromagnetic response and emergent topological orders in transition metal dichalcogenide MoTe$_2$ bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianhong Lu, Yi-Ming Wu, Luiz H. Santos</p>
            <p>Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoTe$_2$, provide a versatile platform for exploring correlated topological phases. This work investigates the interplay of perpendicular magnetic and electric fields in tuning the electronic structure and emergent topological orders of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (t-MoTe$_2$) across two distinct regimes: a low-twist-angle phase ($\theta\approx2.1^\circ$) hosting multiple Chern bands of identical Chern numbers per valley, and a higher-angle phase ($\theta\approx 3.89^\circ$) featuring Haldane-like bands with opposite Chern numbers. Using a continuum model incorporating moiré potentials up to second harmonics, we compute the Hofstadter fractal spectra under applied fields, revealing Landau fan structures and magnetic-flux-dependent band topology. These fractal spectra are useful in studying emergent topological orders in terms of the composite fermion picture, where the statistical Chern-Simons flux is approximated as a uniform gauge field. We demonstrate that the system hosts both Jain-sequence fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) and non-Jain "fractal FCIs" with higher Chern numbers. The electric field suppresses composite fermion gaps and induces topological quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis extends to valley-contrasting flux attachment, proposing pathways to describe fractional quantum spin Hall states.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical perspectives on optical control of magnetism in spin-charge coupled systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahito Mochizuki</p>
            <p>In this article, we review recent theoretical research on photocontrol of magnetism in several spin-charge coupled systems. The control of magnetism with light has been a central issue in condensed-matter physics, attracting enormous research interest both for fundamental science and for technological applications. This field of research has developed rapidly in recent years along with the development of laser technology. However, because the direct coupling between the light magnetic field and magnetization via the Zeeman coupling is very weak in terms of the energy scale, it is, in principle, difficult to induce dramatic effects as far as this magnetic light-matter interaction is exploited. On the contrary, the interaction between the light electric field and electron charges has an energy scale two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of the magnetic interaction. Therefore, we may realize astonishing photoinduced physical phenomena and novel optical device functions by exploiting this electric light-matter interaction. Spin-charge coupled magnets, e.g., double-exchange magnets, multiferroics materials, and Rashba electron systems, in which spins and charges are strongly coupled through several kinds of mechanisms such as exchange interactions and spin-orbit coupling, are ideal systems for realizing this idea. Recent theoretical studies have revealed that it is possible to control, manipulate and switch the magnetization coupled to electron charges in these systems through exciting and/or driving them with light electric fields. The following three recent topics are discussed as examples of such theoretical studies, that is, photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in irradiated double-exchange models, highly efficient photoinduction of spin polarization in Rashba electron systems, and electromagnon excitations and their intense excitation effects in multiferroic materials.</p>

            <p>Polaritons are quantum mechanical superpositions of photon states with elementary excitations in molecules and solids. The light-matter admixture causes a characteristic frequency-momentum dispersion shared by all polaritons irrespective of the microscopic nature of material excitations that could entail charge, spin, lattice or orbital effects. Polaritons retain the strong nonlinearities of their matter component and simultaneously inherit ray-like propagation of light. Polaritons prompt new properties, enable new opportunities for spectroscopy/imaging, empower quantum simulations and give rise to new forms of synthetic quantum matter. Here, we review the emergent effects rooted in polaritonic quasiparticles in a wide variety of their physical implementations. We present a broad portfolio of the physical platforms and phenomena of what we term polaritonic quantum matter. We discuss the unifying aspects of polaritons across different platforms and physical implementations and focus on recent developments in: polaritonic imaging, cavity electrodynamics and cavity materials engineering, topology and nonlinearities, as well as quantum polaritonics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Debashish Mondal, Tanay Nag, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the generation and Josephson current signatures of Floquet Majorana end modes (FMEMs) in a periodically driven altermagnet (AM) heterostructure. Considering a one-dimensional (1D) Rashba nanowire (RNW) proximitized to a regular $s$-wave superconductor and a $d$-wave AM, we generate both $0$- and $\pi$-FMEMs by driving the nontopological phase of the static system. While the static counterpart hosts both topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and non-topological accidental zero modes (AZMs), the drive can gap out the static AZMs and generate robust $\pi$-FMEMs, termed as topological AZMs (TAZMs). We topologically characterize the emergent FMEMs via dynamical winding numbers exploiting chiral symmetry of the system. Moreover, we consider a periodically driven Josephson junction comprising of RNW/AM-based 1D topological superconduting setup. We identify the signature of MZMs and FMEMs utilizing $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect, distinguishing them from trivial AZMs exhibiting $2\pi$-periodicty, in both static and driven platforms. This Josephson current signal due to Majorana modes survives even in presence of finite disorder. Our work establishes a route to realize and identify FMEMs in AM-based platforms through Floquet engineering and Josephson current response.</p>

We reveal the physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon that lead to quantitative control over its strength. Interestingly, we predict exotic electric-field-induced phenomena. This is an analogy to the relationship between exchange bias and the injection of spin currents in spin-transfer-dominated scenarios, which has been reported earlier in the traditional antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic junction.</p>

            <p>It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.</p>

            <p>In the last decades, many efforts have focused on analyzing typical-case hardness in optimization and inference problems. Some recent work has pointed out that polynomial algorithms exist, running with a time that grows more than linearly with the system size, which can do better than linear algorithms, finding solutions to random problems in a wider range of parameters. However, a theory for polynomial and superlinear algorithms is in general lacking. In this paper, we examine the performance of the Simulated Annealing algorithm, a standard, versatile, and robust choice for solving optimization and inference problems, in the prototypical random $K$-Sat problem. For the first time, we show that the algorithmic thresholds depend on the time scaling of the algorithm with the size of the system. Indeed, one can identify not just one, but different thresholds for linear, quadratic, cubic regimes (and so on). This observation opens new directions in studying the typical case hardness in optimization problems.</p>

            <p>Natural or artificial barriers, such as the Himalayas, the Berlin Wall, or the Korean Demilitarized Zone, can significantly impede human migration. As a consequence, they may also hinder the dissemination of opinions within society, thereby contributing to divergent geopolitical landscapes and cultural developments. This raises a fundamental question: how do such barriers influence the opinion dynamics of mobile agents, such as human beings? In particular, can a barrier induce transitions in collective opinion states among spatially segregated groups? Here, we investigate the opinion dynamics governed by majority rule in a minimal model comprising self-propelled agents with binary opinions performing random walks within a closed space divided by a barrier. We focus on the conditions under which initially segregated clusters of agents with opposing opinions can reach consensus. Our results reveal the existence of a critical barrier size that marks a transition between stalemate and consensus states. Near this critical point, the relaxation time to reach consensus from an initial stalemate exhibits a power-law divergence. This barrier-induced stalemate-consensus transition in a simple agent-based model offers new insights into the role of physical or social barriers in shaping opinion dynamics and social structures.</p>

            <p>We present a first-principles approach for calculating phonon-polariton dispersion relations. In this approach, phonon-photon interaction is described by quantization of a Hamiltonian that describes harmonic lattice vibrations coupled with the electromagnetic field inside the material. All Hamiltonian parameters are obtained from first-principles calculations, with diagonalization leading to non-interacting polariton quasiparticles. This method naturally includes retardation effects and resolves non-analytical behavior and ambiguities in phonon frequencies at the Brillouin zone center, especially in non-cubic and optically anisotropic materials. Furthermore, by incorporating higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian, we also account for quasiparticle interactions and spectral broadening. Specifically, we show how anharmonic effects in phonon polaritons lead to a dielectric response that challenges traditional models. The accuracy and consequences of the approach are demonstrated on GaP and GaN as harmonic test systems and PbTe and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ as anharmonic test systems.</p>

            <p>The experimental realizations of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states have been achieved recently, and there is a growing number of experiments in moiré systems showing the inequality between the filling of the Chern band and the quantized Hall conductance: $\nu\neq\sigma_\mathrm{H}$. Among many possible explanations, a popular one is that the topological states have coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders, and such states are referred to as Hall crystals. However, apart from the experimental uncertainties, the generic mechanism of Hall crystals, especially those with fractional $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is still elusive at the microscopic level. In this work, we numerically study a topological flat-band model and find that, the Chern band can be folded by the interaction-driven CDW, and a mini Chern band appears above the CDW gap. Through further analysis, we find the energy dispersion and the fluctuation of quantum geometry of the miniband could be flattened by competing interactions. When further doping this miniband, a series of (F)QAH states are found to coexist with the CDW order at (fractional)integer fillings of the miniband and the Hall conductivities of the FQAH crystals (FQAHCs)- determined by the fillings of the miniband - are different from the fillings of the original Chern band. We also study the thermodynamics of an FQAHC state and find the separation of energy scales and a compressible CDW phase at intermediate temperatures. Our work paves the way for the systematic understanding of (fractional) Hall crystals.</p>

            <h2>A Predictive Theory of Electrochemical Ostwald Ripening for Electrodeposited Lithium Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanning Zhang, Oleg V. Yazyev, Ruslan Yamaletdinov</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of lithium nuclei under the competing effects of electroplating and surface energy-driven redistribution (electrochemical Ostwald ripening). Our model introduces a formulation that accounts for solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) resistance, electrolyte conductivity, and electrode wettability, capturing the transition from SEI to electrolyte-limited growth regimes. We identify asymptotic behaviors for high and low current densities, quantify the conditions under which ripening dominates, and derive analytical expressions for nucleus size, density, and surface coverage. Model predictions show excellent agreement with experimental data across multiple datasets. The results reveal how SEI and electrolyte conductivity, current density and metal-electrode contact angle govern deposition morphology and Coulombic efficiency. Based on these insights, we outline experimentally accessible guidelines to improve battery efficiency and cycling stability - offering a simple yet predictive approach for optimizing metal electrodeposition processes in battery systems and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Realizing high-temperature superconductivity in compressed molecular-hydrogen through Li doping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashok K. Verma, P. Modak</p>
            <p>In this study, we explore lithium-doped stable molecular hydrogen structures by performing first-principles crystal structure searches across varying compositions in the Li-H system under high pressure. Our search reveals a cubic phase of LiH12, which shows promise as a high-temperature superconductor. Our Bader charge analysis suggests that electron transfer from Li to H atoms tunes the intra- and inter-molecular H-H distances, which are critical for the metallization of molecular hydrogen. This modulation alters the interaction between bonding and anti-bonding 1s states of hydrogen molecules. Furthermore, Li ions serve as stabilizers for the distorted H2 molecular network through ionic interactions. Numerical solutions to the fully anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations reveals that this phase could exhibit superconductivity above 300 K at a pressure of 250 GPa, a pressure value that is typically achievable using a diamond anvil cell. Detailed analysis of species-specific phonons and the Eliashberg function shows that low- and intermediate-energy phonons are crucial in promoting strong electron-phonon coupling. Thus, our study establishes lithium doping as a promising approach to induce high-temperature superconductivity in compressed molecular hydrogen without causing molecular dissociation.</p>

            <h2>Sign competing sources of Berry curvature and anomalous Hall conductance humps in topological ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wojciech Brzezicki, Carmine Autieri, Mario Cuoco</p>
            <p>The use of Berry-phase concepts has established a strong link between the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the topological character of the Hall currents. However, the occurrence of sign competition in the Berry curvature often hin- ders the topological origin of the observed anomalous Hall effects. Here, we study a two-dimensional topological ferromagnet with coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom to assess the anomalous Hall effects in the presence of sign- competing sources of Berry curvature. We show that 2D itinerant topological ferromagnets described by t2g electronic states can generally lead to topological metallic bands marked by a non-zero Chern number. We find that the resulting Berry curvature at the Fermi level exhibits a characteristic anisotropic profile with a non-monotonous angular dependence when the magnetization is reversed. The sign change of the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductance can occur together with topological transitions or be driven by the population imbalance of the topological bands. The breaking of the inversion symmetry in- troduces the orbital Rashba coupling in the system. The interplay between the orbital Rashba and sign competing sources of Berry curvature leads to anoma- lies in the anomalous Hall conductance at values of magnetic fields for which the magnetization switches its orientation. The humps in topological ferromag- nets arise when the anomalous Hall conductivity is small in absolute value and they can be detected only close to the sign-change of the AHE and far from half-filling. This study could be relevant for the family of the topological 2D ferromagnets as well as Weyl ferromagnets, and can particularly account for the variety of unconventional behaviors observed in ultrathin films of SrRuO3.</p>

            <p>We report direct spectroscopic evidence of correlation-driven Mott states in layered Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ through combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and dynamical mean-field theory. The Hubbard bands persist down to monolayer, providing the definitive evidence for the Mottness in Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. While the size of the Mott gap remains almost constant across all layers, a striking layer-parity-dependent oscillation emerges in the local density of states (LDOS) between even (n = 2,4,6) and odd layers (n = 1,3,5), which arises from the dimerization and correlation modulation of the obstructed atomic states, respectively. Our conclusions are supported by a critical technical advance in atomic-scale LDOS mapping for highly insulating systems. This work provides the definitive experimental verification of correlation-driven Mott ground states in Nb3Cl8 while establishing a general protocol for investigating the interplay of electronic correlation and interlayer coupling in layered insulators by using low-temperature STM technique.</p>

            <h2>Spin systems as quantum field theories in inflationary universe: A study with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunichiro Kinoshita, Keiju Murata, Daisuke Yamamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii</p>
            <p>We propose a method to probe the thermal properties of quantum field theory (QFT) in an inflationary universe simulated by spin systems. Our previous work (arXiv:2410.07587) has demonstrated that QFT of Majorana fermions in an arbitrary two-dimensional spacetime can be mapped onto a spin system. In this study, we apply this mapping to investigate the thermal properties of an inflationary universe. An interaction between a quantum field and a detector allows one to extract information about the quantum field from the excitation probability of the detector, known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. In an inflationary universe with Hubble constant $H$, the excitation probability of an Unruh-DeWitt detector follows a thermal distribution with temperature $H/(2\pi)$, indicating that a static observer in the inflationary universe perceives a thermal field. We consider a spin system corresponding to QFT in an inflationary universe and introduce a single spin interacting with this system as an Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the detector response asymptotically approaches the result of QFT with an appropriate power of the number of spin sites. Since the dynamics of spin systems can be implemented on programmable quantum simulation platforms, our study offers a concrete route toward experimentally probing the thermal properties of an inflationary universe in controlled quantum settings. This highlights the potential of quantum technologies to emulate and investigate aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermodynamics and semi-definite optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nana Liu, Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at solving SDPs.</p>

            <h2>Skyrmion-vortex hybrid and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shantonu Mukherjee, Amitabha Lahiri</p>
            <p>The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a novel topological structure -- namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a Néel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</p>

            <p>Multiband superconductivity arises when multiple electronic bands contribute to the formation of the superconducting state, allowing distinct pairing interactions and gap structures. Here, we present field- and temperature-dependent data on the vortex lattice structure in 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ as a contribution to the ongoing debate on the nature of the superconductivity in this material. The field-dependent data clearly show that there are two distinct superconducting bands, and the contribution of one of them to the vortex lattice signal is completely suppressed for magnetic fields above $\sim$ 0.8 T, well below $B\mathrm{_{c2}}$. By combining the temperature and field scans, we can deduce that there is a moderate degree of interband coupling. From the observed temperature dependences, we find that at low field and zero temperature, the two gaps in temperature units are 13.1 $\pm$ 0.2 and 6.5 $\pm$ 0.3 K ($\Delta_{0}$ = 1.88 and 0.94 $k\mathrm{_{B}} T\mathrm{_{c}} $); the band with the larger gap gives just under two-thirds of the superfluid density. The penetration depth extrapolated to zero field and zero temperature is 160 $\pm$ 2 nm.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite their potential, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, using first-principles calculations. CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, enabling the manipulation of the Néel vector in CrSb films through a suitable ferromagnetic substrate. The anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities reach their maximum when the Néel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution. Our results demonstrate that CrSb provides a good platform for investigating the Néel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metals.</p>

We demonstrate efficient nonlinear electroluminescence, characterized by a strongly out-of-equilibrium polariton distribution dominated by emission from the upper polariton branches. Model calculations, based on the nonlinear dependence of the emission intensity and spectral narrowing with bias voltage, indicate a polariton occupancy per mode close to unity, with a significant contribution from stimulated polariton emission. These findings open promising prospects for the development of Dirac-Landau polariton condensates and low-threshold, tunable terahertz polariton lasers based on cyclotron emission.</p>

            <h2>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Lunt, Thomas Kriecherbauer, Kenneth T-R McLaughlin, Curt von Keyserlingk</p>
            <p>The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. One common approach is to form a Krylov operator basis $\{O_m \}_{m\ge 0}$, and then approximate the dynamics restricted to the 'fast space' $\{O_m \}_{m\ge n}$ for $n\gg 1$. Denoting the fast space Green's function by $G_n (z)$, in this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \to \infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT). At finite $z$, we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, the same as the average bulk resolvent for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. When $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application we give a new numerical method, the spectral bootstrap, for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof is complex analytic in nature, involving a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. This proof technique assumes some regularity conditions on the spectral function, and we comment on their possible connections to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We are led via steepest-descent to a related Coulomb gas ensemble, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the 'Operator Growth Hypothesis'--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. We then explain the implications of this criticality for the computational resources required to estimate transport coefficients.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengyan Darius Shi, Carolyn Zhang, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>We study quantum phases of a fluid of mobile charged non-abelian anyons, which arise upon doping the lattice Moore-Read quantum Hall state at lattice filling $\nu = 1/2$ and its generalizations to the Read-Rezayi ($\mathrm{RR}_k$) sequence at $\nu = k/(k+2)$. In contrast to their abelian counterparts, non-abelian anyons present unique challenges due to their non-invertible fusion rules and non-abelian braiding structures. We address these challenges using a Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau (CSGL) framework that incorporates the crucial effect of energy splitting between different anyon fusion channels at nonzero dopant density. For the Moore-Read state, we show that doping the charge $e/4$ non-abelion naturally leads to a fully gapped charge-$2$ superconductor without any coexisting topological order. The chiral central charge of the superconductor depends on details of the interactions determining the splitting of anyon fusion channels. For general $\mathrm{RR}_k$ states, our analysis of states obtained by doping the basic non-abelion $a_0$ with charge $e/(k+2)$ reveals a striking even/odd pattern in the Read-Rezayi index $k$. We develop a general physical picture for anyon-driven superconductivity based on charge-flux unbinding, and show how it relates to the CSGL description of doped abelian quantum Hall states. Finally, as a bonus, we use the CSGL formalism to describe transitions between the $\mathrm{RR}_k$ state and a trivial period-$(k+2)$ CDW insulator at fixed filling, driven by the gap closure of the fundamental non-abelian anyon $a_0$. Notably, for $k=2$, this predicts a period-4 CDW neighboring the Moore-Read state at half-filling, offering a potential explanation of recent numerical observations in models of twisted MoTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>Migdal-Eliashberg theory (METh) of boson-mediated superconductivity contains a $\sqrt{\lambda}$ divergence in the critical temperature $T_c$ at strong electron-boson coupling $\lambda$. In conventional METh, the strong-coupling regime can be accessed only in the limit that $\lambda_E = \lambda \, \omega_D/\varepsilon_F\ll1$, where $\omega_D$ is the Debye frequency and $\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. Here we go beyond this restriction in the context of the two-dimensional Yukawa-SYK (Y-SYK) model, which is solvable for arbitrary values of $\lambda_E$. We find that $T_c\approx 0.18 \,\omega_D \sqrt{\lambda}$ for large $\lambda$, provided $\lambda_E$ remains small, and crosses over to a universal value of $T_c \approx 0.04\, \varepsilon_F$ for large $\lambda_E$. The saturation of $T_c$ is due to a self-consistent account of the boson dynamics for large $\lambda_E$ and is arguably qualitatively valid beyond the Y-SYK framework. These results demonstrate how the $\sqrt{\lambda}$ growth of $T_c$ in METh saturates to a universal value independent of $\lambda$ and $\omega_D$, providing an upper bound on the critical temperature at strong electron-boson coupling.</p>

Despite its utility in studying ground states, excited states, and dynamical behaviors, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size presents significant computational challenges. We introduce XDiag, an open-source software package designed to combine advanced and efficient algorithms for ED with and without symmetry-adapted bases with user-friendly interfaces. Implemented in C++ for computational efficiency and wrapped in Julia for ease of use, XDiag provides a comprehensive toolkit for ED calculations. Key features of XDiag include the first publicly accessible implementation of sublattice coding algorithms for large-scale spin system diagonalizations, efficient Lin table algorithms for symmetry lookups, and random-hashing techniques for distributed memory parallelization. The library supports various Hilbert space types (e.g., spin-1/2, electron, and t-J models), facilitates symmetry-adapted block calculations, and automates symmetry considerations. The package is complemented by extensive documentation, a user guide, reproducible benchmarks demonstrating near-linear scaling on thousands of CPU cores, and over 20 examples covering ground-state calculations, spectral functions, time evolution, and thermal states. By integrating high-performance computing with accessible scripting capabilities, XDiag allows researchers to perform state-of-the-art ED simulations and explore quantum many-body phenomena with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.</p>

            <p>The visualization of the magnetic responses of a two-dimensional (2D) superconducting material on the nanoscale is a powerful approach to unravel the underlying supercurrent behavior and to investigate critical phenomena in reduced dimensions. In this study, scanning quantum microscopy is utilized to explore the local magnetic response of the 2D superconductor 2H-NbSe2. Our technique enables both static and dynamic sensing of superconducting vortices with high sensitivity and a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, unveiling unexpected phenomena linked to the intrinsic 2D nature of the superconductor, which are challenging to detect with more conventional local probes. Vortices do not arrange in a hexagonal lattice, but form a distorted vortex glass with expanding vortex size. A vortex can exhibit strong local dynamics due to thermal excitation. As the critical temperature is approached, a clear melting of the vortex glass is identified, leading to distinct configurations under different cooling conditions. Vortex fluctuations can also be probed through spin Hahn-echo measurements, which reveal the spin decoherence even well below the critical temperature -- and, intriguingly, enhanced decoherence at lower temperatures. Spatiotemporal microscopy of the magnetic dynamics associated with vortex excitations and fluctuations provides direct evidence of 2D superconducting phenomena at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>A number of highly polar three ring rod-shaped compounds with a terminal thiophene ring have been synthesized and the physical properties of a subset are reported in detail. On cooling from the isotropic fluid, they directly transition to a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) phase that shows the strongest spatial correlations corresponding to 1/3 of the molecular length (L/3). The set of thiophene compounds reported here have ferroelectric polarizations about 20% larger than that of usual ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal materials. Such large polarization values are due to the ~20% larger mass densities of these thiophene compounds compared to most of the NF materials with short terminal chains. These unusual properties are consequences of tighter molecular packing due to the lack of flexible terminal chains. Below the NF phase, compounds with a single nitro or two cyano polar groups on the terminal benzene ring exhibit a so far never observed smectic phase with periodicity ~1/3 the molecular length. Based on our experimental results, we propose a model of this phase featuring antipolar packing of the molecules within the layers.</p>

An interesting recent study [Nature 584, 59-63 (2020)] has numerically solved a 2-band effective Hamiltonian to show the anomalous Landau level (ALL) spreading $\mathit{\Delta}$ of a singular flat band (SFB), such as hosted in a kagome lattice, in relation to the maximal quantum distance $d$ of the SFB, $\mathit{\Delta}(d)$, which enables a direct measure of quantum geometry. Here, we investigate the ALLs of SFB by studying both the 2-band Hamiltonian and a diatomic kagome lattice hosting two SFBs mirrored by particle-hole symmetry. We derive an exact analytical solution of the 2-band Hamiltonian to show there are two branches of $\mathit{\Delta}(d)$. Strikingly, for the diatomic kagome lattice, $\mathit{\Delta}$ depends on not only $d$ but also $r$, the real-space diatomic distance. As $r$ increases, $\mathit{\Delta}$ shrinks toward zero while $d$ remains intact, which can be intuitively understood from the magnetic-field-induced disruption of destructive interference of the SFB compact localized states. Based on semiclassical theory, we derive rigorously the dependence of $\mathit{\Delta}$ on $r$ that originates from the tuning of the non-Abelian orbital moment of the two SFBs by real-space geometry.</p>

            <h2>The unidirectional Seebeck detection of the Néel vector in the two-dimensional tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Ting Xiao, Ying-Li Wu, Jia-Liang Wan, Xiao-Qin Yu</p>
            <p>The efficient detection of the reversal (180$^{\circ}$ rotation) of the Néel vector is one of the crucial tasks in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a thermal approach to detect the reversal of the Néel vector in the tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnetic materials through the unidirectional Seebeck effect (USE). Being different from the previous works in which USE stems from the global Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or asymmetric magnon scattering, we find that the USE originates from the coupling of the hidden Rashba SOC and the Néel vector in the tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnetic materials in the absence of the global Rashba SOC. Using a generic minimal model, we analyse the behaviors of the USE for the two-dimensional tetragonal lattice $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnet. Importantly, It's found that when the Néel vector is reversed, the sign of the USE changes, which can be utilized to detect the reversal of the Néel vector.</p>

            <h2>Scaling of Quantum Geometry Near the Non-Hermitian Topological Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y R Kartik, Jhih-Shih You, H. H. Jen</p>
            <p>The geometry of quantum states can be an indicator of criticality, yet it remains less explored under non-Hermitian topological conditions. In this work, we unveil diverse scalings of the quantum geometry over the ground state manifold close to different topological phase transitions in a non-Hermitian long-range extension of the Kitaev chain. The derivative of the geometric phase, as well as its scaling behavior, shows that systems with different long-range couplings can belong to distinct universality classes. Near certain criticalities, we further find that the Wannier state correlation function associated with extended Berry connection of the ground state exhibits spatially anomalous behaviors. Finally, we analyze the scaling of the quantum geometric tensor near phase transitions across exceptional points, shedding light on the emergence of novel universality classes.</p>

            <h2>Photocurrent generation from spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Hattori, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryotaro Arita</p>
            <p>Using real-time simulations, we explore the photocurrent induced by localized spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals. These materials exhibit strong spin-charge coupling because the energy scales of the electronic and spin systems are of the same order. The photocurrent response exhibits a pronounced peak reflecting the presence of the Dirac point at the resonance frequency of the localized spin system. This contribution plays a crucial role in the photocurrent generation when the electronic filling is set around the Dirac nodes in the Dirac semimetal. We also reveal that the photocurrent response exhibits a low-frequency divergence due to the modulation of the resonance frequency of the localized spin system. Our findings clarify that the photocurrent response arising from the spin dynamics reflects the band topology of the Dirac semimetals, and the localized spin dynamics plays an important role in the photocurrent generation.</p>

            <p>The proximity induced superconducting (S) correlations in ferromagnetic (F) layers of planar S/F hybrids are shown to be responsible for the appearance of a nonlinear interaction between the magnetic moments of the F layers. This interaction originates from the combined influence of the orbital and exchange phenomena and can result in the spontaneous formation of non-collinear magnetic states in these systems. The proposed nonlinear coupling mechanism and resulting changes of magnetic textures are crucial for the design of the superconducting spintronics devices exploiting the long-range spin triplet proximity effect.</p>

            <p>Local charge, spin, or orbital degrees of freedom with intersite interactions are oftentimes sufficient to construct most quantum orders. This is conventionally true for f-electron systems, where the extent of the f-electrons and their associated crystal-electric-field (CEF) states are strongly localized. Here, polarized Raman spectroscopy measurements of a locally non-centrosymmetric compound, CeCoSi, unveil more CEF excitations than expected in the local model. We interpret this as experimental evidence for the entanglement of CEF states between cerium layers. This composite sublattice, spin, and orbital degree of freedom provides an unconsidered means to form novel orders, not only in this system, but in any system exhibiting globally preserved yet locally broken centrosymmetry.</p>

Inelastic X-ray and neutron scattering derived lattice dynamics of RuO$_2$ are compared to density functional theory calculations of varying flavors. Comparisons among theory with experiments indicate that electronic correlations, rather than magnetic order, are key in describing the lattice dynamics.</p>

            <p>Reducing the thickness of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells is a key objective in order to reduce production cost and to improve sustainability. The major challenge for sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 cells is the recombination at the backside. In standard Cu(In,Ga)Se2 backside recombination is suppressed by a bandgap gradient, acting as a back surface field. This gradient is difficult to maintain in sub-micron thick absorbers. In this study, a hole transport layer passivates the back contact and enables efficient sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells without the need of a Ga gradient. The backside passivation by the hole transport layer is as effective as an optimized Ga gradient, resulting in a significant increase in open-circuit voltage by 80 mV in comparison to the reference sample without passivation. Moreover, the hole transport layer exhibits good transport properties, leading to a fill factor as high as 77%. Photoluminescence quantum yield of 0.15% and solar cell efficiency above 18% are demonstrated in sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers.</p>

            <h2>Quasi-bound layer breathing phonons inside perfect dislocations of lattice-relaxed twisted bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. V. Enaldiev</p>
            <p>Using multiscale modelling we investigate layer breathing phonons in MX$_2$ bilayers (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se) containing dislocations specific for lattice-relaxed moiré superlattices. Spatial modulation of interlayer distance, caused by the dislocations, generates effective potentials that promote emergence of one-dimensional quasi-bound bands of layer breathing modes inside perfect dislocations forming in the bilayers with parallel and antiparallel alignment of layers. We show that for parallel MX$_2$ bilayers perfect dislocations host several quasi-bound bands, with frequencies above layer breathing mode in rhombohedral-stacked domains, whereas for antiparallel bilayers only a single quasi-bound band arises near the edge dislocation type, having frequencies above the layer breathing mode in 2H-stacked domains.</p>

            <h2>Parametrically amplified Josephson plasma waves in YBa_2Cu_3O_(6+x): evidence for local superconducting fluctuations up to the pseudogap temperature $T^*$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marios H. Michael, Eugene Demler, Patrick Lee</p>
            <p>A number of experiments have reported evidence for the existence of the lower Josephson plasmon mode in underdoped YBCO up to the pseudogap temperature scale when the sample is subject to intense terahertz pulses. Evidences include the observation of a reflectivity edge that resembles that of the superconducting state, and the second harmonic generation of a probe optical pulse that is modulated at a frequency similar the reflectivity feature. Since the lower Josephson plasmon mode is often associated with coherent oscillations between bilayers in the YBCO structure, these experiments have led to the suggestion that the intense pump has created pair coherence up to 350K. In this paper, we propose an alternative explanation of these experiments based on the model of short ranged superconducting correlations in the equilibrium state and using the Floquet perspective to analyze optical responses of the photoexcited state. Our model only requires local pairing with phase correlations that can be very short ranged when the system is at equilibrium at a temperature above Tc but below the pseudo-gap temperature T*. Within this assumption there is no phase coherence between bilayers. On the other hand the relative phase between members of the bilayer has a longer in-plane correlation which leads locally to a finite Josephson current. We show that the nonlinearity afforded by the local intra-bilayer Josephson current is sufficient to explain both the reflectivity and second harmonic generation data. The key point is that in the lower Josephson plasmon, the coupling between bilayers is mainly capacitive: the Josepson current between bilayers can be set to zero without affecting the parametric amplification process. The implication is that while superconducting coherence may not be created by the pump, the pseudogap phase must possess a local pairing amplitude at equilibrium.</p>

            <p>The controlled functionalization of graphene is critical for tuning and enhancing its properties, thereby expanding its potential applications. Covalent functionalization offers a deeper tuning of the geometric and electronic structure of graphene compared to non-covalent methods; however, the existing techniques involve side reactions and spatially uncontrolled functionalization, pushing research toward more selective and controlled methods. A promising approach is 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, successfully utilized with carbon nanotubes. In the present work, this method has been extended to graphene flakes with low defect concentration. A key innovation is the use of a custom-synthesized ylide with a protected amine group (Boc), facilitating subsequent attachment of functional molecules. Indeed, after Boc cleavage, fluorescent dyes (Atto 425, 465, and 633) were covalently linked via NHS ester derivatization. This approach represents a highly selective method of minimizing structural damage. Successful functionalization was demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy, confirming the effectiveness of the method. This novel approach offers a versatile platform, enabling its use in biological imaging, sensing, and advanced nanodevices. The method paves the way for the development of sensors and devices capable of anchoring a wide range of molecules, including quantum dots and nanoparticles. Therefore, it represents a significant advancement in graphene-based technologies.</p>

            <h2>Effective Field Theory of Superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoonbai Kim, SeungJun Jeon, Hanwool Song</p>
            <p>A field theory of a Schrödinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of gapless acoustic phonon is proposed for superconductivity of s-waves. Presence of the gapless neutral scalar field is justified as low energy residual acoustic phonon degrees in the context of effective field theory. The critical coupling of quartic self-interaction of complex scalar field is computed from a 1-loop level interaction balance between the repulsion mediated by massive degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by massive Higgs degree, in the static limit. The obtained net attraction or repulsion in perturbative regime matches the type I or II superconductivity, respectively. We find the new critical coupling of cubic Yukawa type interaction between the neutral and complex scalar fields from another tree level interaction balance between the Coulomb repulsion mediated by massless degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by the gapless neutral scalar field, in the static limit. Superconducting phase is realized at or in the vicinity of this critical coupling. A huge discrepancy between the propagation speeds of photon and phonon gives a plausible explanation on low critical temperatures in conventional superconductors.</p>

            <p>Deep neural network quantum states have emerged as a leading method for studying the ground states of quantum magnets. Successful architectures exploit translational symmetry, but the root of their effectiveness and differences between architectures remain unclear. Here, we apply the ConvNext architecture, designed to incorporate elements of transformers into convolutional networks, to quantum many-body ground states. We find that it is remarkably similar to the factored vision transformer, which has been employed successfully for several frustrated spin systems, allowing us to relate this architecture to more conventional convolutional networks. Through a series of numerical experiments we design the ConvNext to achieve greatest performance at lowest computational cost, then apply this network to the Shastry-Sutherland and J1-J2 models, obtaining variational energies comparable to the state of the art, providing a blueprint for network design choices of translationally-symmetric architectures to tackle challenging ground-state problems in frustrated magnetism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristof Moors, Gen Yin</p>
            <p>In magnetic topological insulators, a phase transition between quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) and Anderson localization insulating phases can be triggered by the rotation of an applied magnetic field. Without the scattering paths along magnetic domains, this phase transition is governed by scattering induced by nonmagnetic disorder. We show that the QAH phase is strikingly robust in the presence of spatially uncorrelated disorder. The robustness is attributed to a resilience of the topological band gap against disorder, induced by quantum confinement. The critical behavior near the phase transition suggests that the scattering is distinct from quantum percolation. This provides new insights on the robustness of the QAH effect in magnetic topological insulators with atomic defects, impurities, and dopants.</p>

In contrast, for an ideal quantum Bose (Fermi) gas, the thermodynamic curvature is positive (negative), indicating intrinsic attractive (repulsive) interactions. We generalize the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution by employing a generalized form of the exponential function, proposing the Mittag-Leffler Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution within the framework of superstatistics. We demonstrate that the generalization parameter, $\alpha$, quantifies the statistical interaction. When $\alpha = 1$, the distribution coincides with the standard classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, where no statistical interaction is present. For $0 < \alpha < 1$ ($\alpha > 1$), the statistical interaction is repulsive (attractive), corresponding to a negative (positive) thermodynamic curvature of the system.</p>

            <p>The wurtzite structure is one of the most frequently found crystal structures in modern semiconductors and its inherent spontaneous polarization is a defining materials property. Despite this significance, confusion has been rampant in the literature with respect to the orientation of the spontaneous polarization inside the unit cell of the wurtzite structure, especially for the technologically very relevant III-N compounds (AlN, GaN, InN). In particular, the spontaneous polarization has been reported to either point up or down for the same unit cell orientation, depending on the literature source - with important implications for, e.g., the carrier type and density expected at interfaces of heterostructures involving materials with wurtzite-structure. This perspective aims to resolve this ambiguity by reviewing available reports on the direction of the energetically preferred polarization direction in the presence of external electric fields, as well as atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy images. While we use ferroelectric wurtzite AlScN as a key example, our conclusions are generalizable to other compounds with the same crystal structure. We demonstrate that a metal-polar unit cell must be associated with an upward polarization vector - which is contrary to long-standing conventional wisdom.</p>

            <p>In this study, we investigate the ion-irradiation-induced phase transition in gallium oxide (Ga2O3) from the $\beta$ to the $\gamma$ phase, the role of defects during the transformation, and the quality of the resulting crystal structure. Using a multi-method analysis approach including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode (RBS/c), Doppler broadening variable energy positron annihilation spectroscopy (DB-VEPAS) and variable energy positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (VEPALS) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have characterized defects at all the relevant stages before, during, and after the phase transition. Reduction in backscattering yield was observed in RBS/c spectra after the transition to the $\gamma$ phase. This is corroborated by a significant decrease in the positron trapping center density due to generation of embedded vacancies intrinsic for the $\gamma$-Ga2O3 but too shallow in order to trap positrons. A comparison of the observed positron lifetime of $\gamma$-Ga2O3 with different theoretical models shows good agreement with the three-site $\gamma$ phase approach. A characteristic increase in the effective positron diffusion length and the positron lifetime at the transition point from $\beta$-Ga2O3 to $\gamma$-Ga2O3 enables visualization of the phase transition with positrons for the first time. Moreover, a subsequent reduction of these quantities with increasing irradiation fluence was observed, which we attribute to further evolution of the $\gamma$-Ga2O3 and changes in the gallium vacancy density as well as relative occupation in the crystal lattice.</p>

            <p>Ru$_3$Sn$_7$, an intermetallic compound with advanced catalytic properties, exhibits a complex crystal structure and intriguing electronic properties, making it an attractive candidate for investigations under high-pressure (HP). The structural, vibrational and electronic band structure of this compound were investigated at HP up to ~ 20 GPa using synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction, micro-Raman, and density functional theory (DFT), respectively. Despite the local structural changes implied by a discernible reduction in the compressibility and distinct slope changes in the pressure evolution of the symmetric stretching vibrations of the Ru and Sn atoms around 8 GPa, the cubic structure is found to be stable throughout the pressure range. In support, our calculated phonon dispersion relation confirmed the stability of the cubic phase till the highest pressures. A comprehensive analysis of the Raman spectrum reveals the signatures of the pressure induced sudden strengthening of electron-phonon coupling as early as 3 GPa which is backed by a bounce in the phonon and electron density of states (DoS). Electronic structure calculations demonstrate that the metallic nature of Ru$_3$Sn$_7$ is preserved in the studied pressure range with a minor redistribution of electronic DoS across the Fermi level (EF). The band structure calculations predict intriguing changes in the electronic structure, revealing the pressure induced dp hybridization through the high symmetry point of the Brillouin zone which is largely responsible for the observed reduction in the compressibility and enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling in Ru$_3$Sn$_7$.</p>

In this work we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study the properties of the aqueous interfaces of various GaP non-polar (110) and polar (001) terminations. We calculate their band alignment with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode potential and investigate their interfacial structural properties. Based on these properties we assess the capability of the various terminations to catalyze the reactions associated with water splitting and propose approaches for improving the performance of GaP for application in PECs.</p>

            <p>Transition metal aluminum nitrides are a technologically important class of multifunctional ceramics. While the HfAlN system is to a large extent unexplored, we study phase stability, nanostructure design, and mechanical properties of rocksalt cubic (c-) phase and wurtzite-hexagonal (h-) phase Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ thin films grown on MgO(001) substrates using ion-assisted reactive magnetron sputtering. Single-crystal c-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ films were obtained with $x < 0.30$. Spinodal decomposition taking place during film deposition resulted in a three-dimensional checkerboard superstructure of AlN-rich and HfN-rich nanodomains, as opposed to a metastable cubic solid solution. Lattice-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy and x-ray and electron diffraction reveals that the superstructure period is along all three <100> directions and scales almost linearly between 9-13 A with increasing Al content. For $x > 0.41$, however, nanocrystalline h-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ consisting of segregated Hf- and Al-rich nanodomains in a (0001) fiber texture forms. The nanoindentation hardness of these films increases sharply with x, from 26 GPa for HfNy, to 38 GPa for c-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$, due to dislocation pinning at the superstructure strain fields. The hardness drops to 22 GPa for the softer h-Hf1-xAlxNy, still remaining considerably higher than that of a binary AlN. In micropillar compression testing, c-Hf$_{0.93}$Al$_{0.07}$N$_{1.15}$ exhibits a linear elastic response up until strain burst, with brittle fracture occurring at a much higher yield stress compared to HfN$_y$, on {110}<011> slip systems, which is attributed to superstructure inhibited dislocation motion. In contrast, h-Hf$_{0.59}$Al$_{0.41}$N$_{1.23}$ exhibits limited plasticity and a high yield stress followed by strain burst, attributed to the nanocrystalline structure.</p>

            <p>In this study, we report on the spontaneous formation of highly ordered 2D layered domains of intermetallic phase PtSn4 in Sn nanoparticles of dimensions of the order of 10 nm during the gas aggregation process occurring in Supersonic Cluster Beam Deposition. Phase identification is based on High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy and on X-ray emission analysis coupled with Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy. We propose that PtSn4-ordered domains precipitate inside Sn nanoparticles once the temperature drops below 520°C upon collisional cooling with room temperature Argon, while the nanoparticles persist longer in a liquid state. Sn matrix eventually solidifies upon the sudden temperature drop due to the supersonic expansion. 2D-layered PtSn4 domains create interparticle heterostructures that disrupt the spherical symmetry typical of gas aggregation processes and separate the Sn particle into distinct parts. The Dirac nodal arc semimetal character of PtSn4 makes it particularly interesting for studying the transport mechanisms in nanogranular films obtained by the soft-assembling of such nanoparticles, which feature a network of heterostructures showing sequences of alternate PtSn4 2D domains and metallic \b{eta}-Sn necks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lois Smith, Jessica Steele, Hossein Ali Karimi-Varzaneh, Paola Carbone</p>
            <p>Plasticisers (PLs) are small additives commonly incorporated into polymer composites to enhance processability and improve mechanical properties. Their effectiveness depends heavily on their miscibility within the polymer melt, yet isolating the influence of plasticiser properties, such as flexibility and geometry, remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the time consuming nature of experimental work and also from the presence of impurities and inconsistencies that often arise during synthesis and testing. Atomistic simulations face similar difficulties as phase separation can occur over microsecond timescales, which can be computationally expensive. In this work, we use a coarse-grained bead-and-spring model to screen plasticisers of varying flexibilities and geometries to build a pool-based active learning procedure which characterizes their design space and its effect on polymer/plasticiser miscibility. We perform an active learning cycle with a random forest model and an uncertainty/random hybrid query strategy to determine the miscibility behaviour of queried molecules. This is evaluated through computationally expensive, coarse-grained polymer/plasticiser simulations of a cis-(1,4)-polyisoprene melt filled with small hydrocarbon additives of varying sizes and rigidities. Through this, we are able to efficiently improve model performance in order to make predictions on the entire PL design space. Such findings enable us to determine a new set of general plasticiser design rules, suitable for non-polar molecules, which expands on our previous work. To further prove this, we perform atomistic simulations of polyisoprene/plasticiser systems which are approximately back-mapped from their coarse-grained equivalents. Our findings indicate that the polyisoprene/plasticiser phase behaviour, observed using the coarse-grained model for PLs in the absence of side chains, is valid.</p>

            <p>Oxynitrides are used in a variety of applications including photocatalysts, high-k dielectrics or wear-resistant coatings and often show intriguing multi-functionality. To accelerate the co-optimization of the relevant material properties of these compositionally complex oxynitride systems, high-throughput synthesis and characterization methods are desirable. In the present work, three approaches were investigated to obtain orthogonal anion and cation gradients on the same substrate by magnetron sputtering. The different approaches included varying positions of the local reactive gas inlets and different combinations of target materials. The best performing approach was applied to screen a large two-dimensional area of the quaternary phase space within the Al-Si-O-N system. This material system is a promising candidate for transparent protective coatings with variable refractive indices. With only five depositions of combinatorial libraries, an anion composition range of 2-46% O/(N+O) and a cation composition range of 4-44% Si/(Al+Si) is covered. For lower oxygen and silicon contents, a region with hardness of up to 25 GPa is observed, where the material exhibits either wurtzite AlN or a composite microstructure. By increasing the deposition temperature to 400 °C, an extension of this region can be achieved. At higher oxygen and silicon contents, the structure of the samples is X-ray amorphous. In this structural region, an intimate correlation between hardness and refractive index is confirmed. The results of this study introduce a practical approach to perform high-throughput development of mixed anion materials, which is transferable to many materials systems and applications.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging high fluence and low pressure for pulsed laser deposition of high-mobility $γ$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thor Hvid-Olsen, Christina Hoegfeldt, Amit Chanda, Alessandro Palliotto, Dae-Sung Park, Thomas Sand Jespersen, Felix Trier</p>
            <p>High-mobility oxide heterostructures could be applied for high-frequency devices, transparent conductors, and spin-orbit logic devices. SrTiO$_3$ is one of the most studied oxide substrate materials for heterostructures. To date, the highest SrTiO3-based charge carrier mobility at 2 K was measured in the interfacial 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$. The formation mechanism and origin of the high electron mobility are not yet fully understood. This investigation presents a successful growth protocol to synthesise high mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces, and a description of the underlying growth optimisation. Furthermore, indicative features of high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, including the room-temperature sheet resistance, are presented. Signs of epitaxial and crystalline growth are found in a high-mobility sample ($\mu^{10K} = 1.6 \times 10^4 \mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{Vs}$). Outlining the growth mechanisms and comparing 40 samples, indicates that high-fluence ($F > 3\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) and low pressure ($P \approx 1 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{mbar}$) are essential growth parameters for high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Carta, Iurii Timrov, Sophie Beck, Claude Ederer</p>
            <p>The predictive accuracy of popular extensions to density-functional theory (DFT) such as DFT+U and DFT plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) hinges on using realistic values for the screened Coulomb interaction U. Here, we present a systematic comparison of the two most widely used approaches to compute this parameter, linear response theory (LRT) and the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA), using a unified framework based on the use of maximally localized Wannier functions to define the underlying basis sets. We demonstrate good quantitative agreement between LRT and cRPA in cases where the strongly interacting subspace corresponds to an isolated set of bands. Differences can be assigned to neglecting the response of the exchange-correlation potential in cRPA and the presence of additional screening channels in LRT. Moreover, we show that in cases with strong hybridization between interacting and screening subspaces, the application of cRPA becomes ambiguous and can lead to unrealistically small U values, while LRT remains well-behaved. Our work clarifies the relation between both methods, sheds light on their strengths and limitations, and emphasizes the importance of using a consistent set of Wannier orbitals to ensure transferability of U values between different implementations.</p>

            <h2>Large Topological Magnetic Optical Effects and Imaging of Antiferromagnetic Octupole Domains of an Altermagnet-like Weyl Semimetal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingyue Han, Xiaoran Liu, Mikhail Kareev, Jak Chakhalian, Liang Wu</p>
            <p>Pyrochlore iridates have attracted significant interest due to their complex phase behavior arising from the interplay among electron correlations, quantum metric in flat bands, geometrically frustrated lattices, and topology induced by strong spin-orbit coupling. In this study, we focus on Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ thin films oriented along the (111) crystallographic direction. This quantum material, identified as an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal, exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect in transport experiments. Here we employ optical circular dichroism microscopy, to directly image ferroic octupole order and resolve all-in--all-out and all-out--all-in antiferromagnetic domains below the Néel temperature. Remarkably, despite the absence of a detectable net magnetic moment at zero applied magnetic field, we detected a large magnetic circular dichroism signal ($\sim 10^{-4}$) and Kerr effect ($\sim 10^{-4}$ radians) in zero magnetic field attributable to Berry curvature effects from Weyl nodes. Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ is a non-collinear magnet with vanishing net moment and magnetic octupole order, similar to the recently proposed collinear d-wave altermagnets, allowing for magneto-optical responses and anomalous Hall effect. This finding likely represents the first demonstration of magnetic circular dichroism and Kerr effect in a topologically non-trivial quantum antiferromagnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Our work opens up the possibility of ultrafast domain switching in the terahertz frequency and the domain wall dynamics in the magnetic Weyl systems, which establishes the foundation for topological antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the anomalous proximity effect in a ballistic normal metal/diffusive normal metal/superconductor junction based on Rashba semiconductor nanowire model. The system hosts two distinct phases: a trivial helical phase with zero-energy Andreev Bound States and a topological phase with Majorana Bound States. We analyze the local density of states and induced pair correlations at the edge of the normal metal region. We investigate their behavior under scalar onsite disorder and changing the Superconductor and diffusive regions lengths in the trivial helical and topological phases. We find that both phases exhibit a zero-energy peak in the local density of states and spin-triplet pair correlations in the clean limit, which we attribute primarily to odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs. Disorder rapidly splits the zero-energy peak in the trivial helical phase regardless of the lengths of the superconductor and diffusive normal regions. The zero-energy peak in the topological phase show similar fragility when the superconductor region is short. However, for long superconductor regions, the zero-energy peak in the topological phase remain robust against disorder. In contrast, spin-singlet correlations are suppressed near zero energy in both phases. Our results highlight that the robustness of the zero-energy peak against scalar disorder, contingent on the Superconductor region length, serves as a key indicator distinguishing trivial Andreev bound states from topological Majorana bound states.</p>

            <h2>Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luiz Menon, Pablo de Castro, Celia Anteneodo</p>
            <p>The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in deforested regions.</p>

            <h2>Many-Body Quantum Optics in a Bose-Hubbard Waveguide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Roccati</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between quantum emitters and guided photons in one-dimension. When the waveguide hosts interacting photons, it becomes a platform to explore many-body quantum optics. However, the influence of photonic correlations on emitter dynamics remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the collective decay and coherent interactions of quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard waveguide, an array of coupled photonic modes with repulsive on-site interactions that supports superfluid and Mott insulating phases. We show that photon-photon interactions alone can trigger a superradiant burst, independent of emitter spacing and transition frequency. In the off-resonant regime, emitters exhibit two distinct types of mediated interactions: delocalized superfluid excitations yield distance-independent couplings, while Mott-insulator quasiparticles generate short-range interactions mediated by doublons and holons. Our work bridges many-body physics and waveguide QED, revealing how photonic many-body states shape emitter dynamics.</p>

            <p>We consider rigorous consequences of modular invariance for two-dimensional unitary non-rational CFTs with $c > 1$. Simple estimates for the torus partition function can lead to remarkably strong results. We show in particular that the spectral density of spin-$J$ operators must grow like $\exp\left( \pi \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}(c-1) J} \right)/\sqrt{2J}$ in any twist interval at or above $(c-1)/12$, with a known twist-dependent prefactor. This proves that the large $J$ spectrum becomes dense even without averaging over spins. For twists below $(c-1)/12$ we establish that the growth must be strictly slower. Finally, we estimate how fast the maximal gap between two spin-$J$ operators must go to zero as $J$ becomes large.</p>

            <p>Recent advances have defined nontrivial phases of matter in open quantum systems, such as many-body quantum states subject to environmental noise. In this work, we experimentally probe and characterize mixed-state phases on Quantinuum's H1 quantum computer using two measures: Renyi correlators and the coding performance of a quantum error-correcting code associated with the phase. As a concrete example, we probe the low-energy states of the critical transverse field Ising model under different dephasing noise channels. First, we employ shadow tomography to observe a newly proposed Renyi correlator in two distinct phases: one exhibiting power-law decay and the other long-ranged. Second, we investigate the decoding fidelity of the associated quantum error-correcting code using a variational quantum circuit, and we find that a shallow circuit is sufficient to distinguish the above-mentioned two mixed-state phases through the decoding performance quantified by entanglement fidelity. Our work is a proof of concept for the quantum simulation and characterization of mixed-state phases.</p>

This correspondence also enables a sequential generation protocol: the states can be prepared through a series of unitary transformations acting on an auxiliary system. We also discuss the conditions under which these states have local, frustration-free parent Hamiltonians.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer-Accelerated Ground-State Estimation of Quantum Many-Body Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline E. P . Robin</p>
            <p>We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</p>

            <h2>A Data-Driven Method for Modeling Creep-Fatigue Stress-Strain Behavior Using Neural ODEs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Deng, Mark C. Messner</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce a data-driven machine learning approach for modeling one-dimensional stress-strain behavior under cyclic loading, utilizing experimental data from the nickel-based Alloy 617. The study employs uniaxial creep-fatigue test data acquired under various loading histories and compares two distinct neural network-based ODE models. The first model, known as the black-box model, comprehensively describes the strain-stress relationship using a Neural ODE equation. To interpret this black-box model, we apply the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) technique, transforming the black-box model into an equation-based model using symbolic regression. The second model, the Neural flow rule model, incorporates Hooke's Law for the linear elastic component, with the nonlinear part characterized by a Neural ODE. Both models are trained with experimental data to accurately reflect the observed stress-strain behavior. We conduct a detailed comparison with the standard Chaboche model, which includes three back stresses. Our results demonstrate that the neural network-based ODE models precisely capture the experimental creep-fatigue mechanical behavior, exceeding the standard Chaboche model's accuracy. Furthermore, an interpretable model derived from the black-box neural ODE model through symbolic regression achieves accuracy comparable to the Chaboche model, enhancing its interpretability. The results highlight the potential of neural network-based ODE models to depict complex creep-fatigue behavior, eliminating the necessity for experts to define a specific, material-focused model form.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping many aspects of materials science and chemistry research, enabling advances in molecular property prediction, materials design, scientific automation, knowledge extraction, and more. Recent developments demonstrate that the latest class of models are able to integrate structured and unstructured data, assist in hypothesis generation, and streamline research workflows. To explore the frontier of LLM capabilities across the research lifecycle, we review applications of LLMs through 34 total projects developed during the second annual Large Language Model Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, a global hybrid event. These projects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property prediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel interfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data management and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature. Collectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile predictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools, and much more. In particular, improvements in both open source and proprietary LLM performance through the addition of reasoning, additional training data, and new techniques have expanded effectiveness, particularly in low-data environments and interdisciplinary research. As LLMs continue to improve, their integration into scientific workflows presents both new opportunities and new challenges, requiring ongoing exploration, continued refinement, and further research to address reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of $N$-dimensional lattices of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons coupled with a flow of electrical current. We consider both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, homogeneous and heterogeneous neurons, and small and large lattices over a wide range of electrical coupling strengths. As the coupling strength is varied, the neurons exhibit a number of complex dynamical regimes, including unsynchronized chaotic spiking, local quasi-bursting, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical effects arising from the ``destructive interference'' of many connected neurons and miniature ``phase transitions'' from coordinated spiking threshold crossings. In large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent dynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag synchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from coupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how dimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective behavior of neuronal systems.</p>

            <h2>Fabrication-Directed Entanglement for Designing Chiral and Anisotropic Metamaterial Foams</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Revier, Jeffrey Ian Lipton</p>
            <p>Entangled networks are fundamental in various systems, from biological structures to engineered materials. Current techniques for programming entanglement often rely on intricate chemistry or result in statistically homogeneous networks, limiting the ability to create spatially patterned structures with precisely engineered functions. Thus, a key challenge remains in developing approaches to program complex mechanical behaviors, such as anisotropy and chirality, within monolithic entangled structures. This work introduces Fabrication-Directed Entanglement (FDE), a methodology integrating viscous thread printing (VTP) and topology optimization (TO) to program the entanglement of a single homogeneous filament. By spatially adjusting VTP parameters (deposition height, speed), we control local coiling density, creating quasi-two-phase (dense/sparse) regions within a monolithic entangled foam. Topology optimization guides the placement of these regions to achieve target macroscopic mechanical properties. Here we show foam-like mechanical metamaterials with tunable compliance, rigidity, and chirality. Experimental testing and simulation confirm that FDE expands the achievable material property space compared to homogeneous VTP foams, enabling properties like tunable directional stiffness, Poisson's ratios from $\nu\approx0.06~\text{to}~0.56$, and novel significant normal-shear coupling ($\eta_{212}\approx0.72$) from a single base material. This approach offers a viable new pathway for designing complex, functional entangled foam structures with tailored mechanical behaviors.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates absorbing-state phase transitions in opinion dynamics through a master-node network model analyzed using annealing approximation. We develop a theoretical framework examining three fundamental regimes: systems converging to complete disagreement, complete consensus, or both states depending on initial conditions. The phase behavior is governed by two key chiral parameters - R measuring right-oriented influence and L measuring left-oriented influence in the network interactions. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring both continuous and discontinuous transitions between disordered and ordered phases. The discontinuous transition emerges in systems with two absorbing states, where the final configuration depends critically on initial opinion distributions. The annealing approximation provides fundamental insights into how asymmetric social influences (chirality) shape collective opinion formation, acting as a symmetry-breaking element that drives the system toward polarization or consensus.</p>

            <p>Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.</p>

            <p>Poly(vinyl alcohol)/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) blends at mass ratio 3:1 with Nano - Graphene Platelet fillers constitute mechanically and thermally stable systems, which are used for developing piezoelectric devices. Blends host a fraction of water molecules absorbed by the poly(vinyl alcohol) phase. Dc conductivity and dielectric relaxation occur via fluctuation induced tunneling of electrons. Electric charge transport is affected by the glass transition of the polymer matrix and the rotational and translational dynamics of absorbed water molecules. In the present work, absorbed water was subtracted by annealing and pumping and, subsequently, dry blends were characterized by employing Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy at combined temperature and pressure states. Conductivity and relaxation obey fluctuation induced tunneling temperature dependencies. The corresponding activation energies and activation volumes reveal the role of absorbed polar water molecules on the tunneling current for macroscopic or localized electron transport.</p>

            <p>Modern chess engines significantly outperform human players and are essential for evaluating positions and move quality. These engines assign a numerical evaluation $E$ to positions, indicating an advantage for either white or black, but similar evaluations can mask varying levels of move complexity. While some move sequences are straightforward, others demand near-perfect play, limiting the practical value of these evaluations for most players. To quantify this problem, we use entropy to measure the complexity of the principal variation (the sequence of best moves). Variations with forced moves have low entropy, while those with multiple viable alternatives have high entropy. Our results show that, except for experts, most human players struggle with high-entropy variations, especially when $|E|<100$ centipawns, which accounts for about $2/3$ of positions. This underscores the need for AI-generated evaluations to convey the complexity of underlying move sequences, as they often exceed typical human cognitive capabilities, reducing their practical utility.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a significant material for quantum sensing, particularly due to its ability to host spin active defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center). The optical addressability of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center and hBN's 2D structure enable high spatial resolution and integration into various platforms. However, decoherence due to the strong magnetic noise in hBN imposes fundamental limitations on the sensitivity of V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center-based applications. Understanding the phenomena behind decoherence and identifying parameter settings that provide the highest performance are essential for advancing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ sensors. This study employs state-of-the-art computational methods to investigate the decoherence of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide range of magnetic field values from 0 T up to 3 T. The provided in-depth numerical and analytical analysis reveals an intricate interplay of various decoherence mechanisms. This study identifies five distinct magnetic field regions governed by different types of magnetic interactions with and within the abundant nuclear spin bath. In addition to magnetic field, the effects of zero-field splitting, nuclear polarization, and different hyperfine coupling terms are studied, representing an important step forward in utilizing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles in sensing. In particular, this study proposes operation in the moderate $180-350$ mT magnetic field range in chemically pure h$^{11}$B$^{15}$N samples, where the coherence time can reach $1-20$ $\mu$s, significantly exceeding the $\mathcal{O}( 100~\text{ns})$ low-field $T_2$ values.</p>

Such a symmetry enlargement is hindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical point, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term triggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice gauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\oplus$O(3) multicritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible implications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>We perform narrowline cooling of single dysprosium atoms trapped in a 1D optical tweezers array, employing the narrow single-photon transition at 741 nm. At the trapping wavelength of 532 nm, the excited state is less trapped than the ground state. To obtain efficient cooling performances, we chirp the frequency of the cooling beam to subsequently address the red sidebands of different motional states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the cooling protocol through Raman thermometry, which we characterize for our experimental conditions. We obtain an array of 75 atoms close to the motional ground state in the radial direction of the tweezers. Our results demonstrate the possibility to manipulate the motional degree of freedom of dysprosium in optical tweezers arrays, a key ingredient to exploit the potential of lanthanide-based tweezers platforms for quantum science.</p>

            <h2>Barrier induced stalemate-consensus transition of self-propelled participants subject to majority rule</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan-Wen Xiao, Wei-Chen Guo, Bao-Quan Ai, Liang He</p>
            <p>Natural or artificial barriers, such as the Himalayas, the Berlin Wall, or the Korean Demilitarized Zone, can significantly impede human migration. As a consequence, they may also hinder the dissemination of opinions within society, thereby contributing to divergent geopolitical landscapes and cultural developments. This raises a fundamental question: how do such barriers influence the opinion dynamics of mobile agents, such as human beings? In particular, can a barrier induce transitions in collective opinion states among spatially segregated groups? Here, we investigate the opinion dynamics governed by majority rule in a minimal model comprising self-propelled agents with binary opinions performing random walks within a closed space divided by a barrier. We focus on the conditions under which initially segregated clusters of agents with opposing opinions can reach consensus. Our results reveal the existence of a critical barrier size that marks a transition between stalemate and consensus states. Near this critical point, the relaxation time to reach consensus from an initial stalemate exhibits a power-law divergence. This barrier-induced stalemate-consensus transition in a simple agent-based model offers new insights into the role of physical or social barriers in shaping opinion dynamics and social structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Javier Alfaro-Mozaz, Iñigo Liberal</p>
            <p>Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) thin films facilitate strong light-matter interactions with a widespread impact in nonlinear, quantum and thermal photonics. Here, we extend the scope of thin film ENZ modes by elucidating the generalized polaritonic modes emerging from anisotropy and near-zero permittivity. Through a theoretical investigation of generalized ENZ polaritons on silicon carbide (SiC) metasurfaces, we reveal a complex polaritonic landscape, consisting of a seven-region phase diagram. We show that the complex interplay between material properties and geometry changes the nature of the modes, and we clarify when ENZ modes with closed and open isofrequency curves (IFCs) can be observed, and how they coexist with surface phonon-polaritons and hyperbolic modes. The associated photonic topological transitions are accompanied by phase velocity sign reversals and induce dramatic modifications of near-field profiles and Purcell enhancement factors. Our work merges insights from anisotropic and ENZ effects, enabling enhanced control over polariton behavior with broad implications for subwavelength optics, material design, nonlinear effects, thermal emission, and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Camilli, Daria Tieplova, Eleonora Bergamin, Jean Barbier</p>
            <p>We rigorously analyse fully-trained neural networks of arbitrary depth in the Bayesian optimal setting in the so-called proportional scaling regime where the number of training samples and width of the input and all inner layers diverge proportionally. We prove an information-theoretic equivalence between the Bayesian deep neural network model trained from data generated by a teacher with matching architecture, and a simpler model of optimal inference in a generalized linear model. This equivalence enables us to compute the optimal generalization error for deep neural networks in this regime. We thus prove the "deep Gaussian equivalence principle" conjectured in Cui et al. (2023) (arXiv:2302.00375). Our result highlights that in order to escape this "trivialisation" of deep neural networks (in the sense of reduction to a linear model) happening in the strongly overparametrized proportional regime, models trained from much more data have to be considered.</p>

            <p>Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure, and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance, and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance, and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology, and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingdi Xu, Zijun Wei, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan</p>
            <p>We study the thermalization dynamics of a quantum system embedded in an incommensurate potential and coupled to a Markovian thermal reservoir. The dephasing induced by the bath drives the system toward an infinite-temperature steady state, erasing all initial information-including signatures of localization. We find that initially localized states can relax to the homogeneous steady state faster than delocalized states. Moreover, low-temperature initial states thermalize to infinite temperature more rapidly than high-temperature states-a phenomenon reminiscent of the Mpemba effect, where hotter liquids freeze faster than warmer ones. The slowest relaxation mode in the Liouvillian plays critical role in the expedited thermalization for localized or cold initial states. Our results reveal that the combination of disordered structure and environmental dissipation may lead to non-trivial thermalization behavior, which advances both the conceptual framework of the Mpemba effect and the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium processes in dissipative disordered systems.</p>

            <p>Topological phases of matter commonly feature protected states at their boundaries. Transferring this protection to time-metamaterials is extremely challenging, as it requires the generation of an abrupt interface between two topologically distinct bulks. Here, we realize and measure an ultrafast topological non-Hermitian skin mode bound to an interface circulating within the cavity of a fast-gain semiconductor laser. The nonlinear stationary state generated in such devices features a jump in the instantaneous frequency. We show that this discontinuity gives rise to a topological interface for the field fluctuations in the system. Using direct intensity sampling, we experimentally measure the skin modes and their positioning at the frequency jump of the stationary state. Analysis of these isolated modes reveals an ultrashort full-width at half-maximum of 583 $\pm$ 16 fs. Furthermore, we show that we can tune the shape and relative timing shift of the skin modes via external bias modulation. Finally, both numerical and experimental analysis of the noise in the system reveal that field fluctuations are funneled into the topological interface. Our findings reveal a new way to generate topologically protected states of light in time, which paves the way for novel time-varying physics as well as metrological applications.</p>

Such ensembles provide a model for the final states when isolated quantum systems thermalize, as they can reproduce thermal properties locally, while being globally pure. By an analysis using real replicas and the coherent state representation of Gaussian states we show that the average entanglement entropy of a small subsystem is the same as the von Neumann entropy of a mixed Gaussian state with the same marginals, but no correlations. Finally, we discuss how these ensembles provide a model for Hawking radiation assuming unitary evolution, and discuss some of their properties in relations to the Page curve of Hawking radiation.</p>

            <p>Realizing two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets is important for spintronics applications. Here we propose a microscopic template for stabilizing 2D altermagnetism through Van Hove singularities that are coincident in both energy and momentum. These coincident Van Hove singularities are a generic consequence of non-symmorphic symmetries in nine 2D space groups. Due to nontrivial symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian, these coincident Van Hove singularities allow new hopping interactions between the Van Hove singularities that do not appear in analogous Van Hove singularity based patch models for cuprates and graphene. We show these new interactions can give rise to various weak coupling, and BCS-based instabilities, including altermagnetism, nematicity, inter-band d-wave superconductivity, and orbital altermagnetic order. We apply our results to quasi-2D organic $\kappa$-Cl in which altermagnetism is known to appear.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive theoretical and computational model that explores the behavior of a thin hydrated film bonded to a non-hydrated / impermeable soft substrate in the context of surface and bulk elasticity coupled with surface diffusion kinetics. This type of coupling can manifests as an integral aspect in diverse engineering processes encountered in optical interference coatings, tissue engineering, soft electronics, and can prove important in design process for the next generation of sensors and actuators, especially as the focus is shifted to systems in smaller lengthscales. The intricate interplay between solvent diffusion and deformation of the film is governed by surface poroelasticity, and the viscoelastic deformation of the substrate. While existing methodologies offer tools for studying coupled poroelasticity involving solvent diffusion and network deformation, there exists a gap in understanding how coupled poroelastic processes occurring in a film attached to the boundary of a highly deformable solid can influence its response. In this study, we introduce a non-equilibrium thermodynamics formulation encompassing the multiphysical processes of surface poroelasticity and bulk viscoelasticity, complemented by a corresponding finite element implementation. Our approach captures the complex dynamics between the finite deformation of the substrate and solvent diffusion on the surface. This work contributes valuable insights, particularly in scenarios where the coupling of surface diffusion kinetics and substrate elasticity is an important design factor.</p>

            <p>A robust theory of the mechanism of pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity (i.e. where Cooper pairs have nonzero center of mass momentum) remains elusive. Here we explore the triangular lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ model, a low-energy effective theory derived from the strong-coupling limit of the Holstein-Hubbard model, by large-scale variational Monte Carlo simulations. When the electron density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW, consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit. Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in the intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.</p>

            <h2>Recoverable strain in amorphous materials: the role of ongoing plastic events following initial elastic recoil</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry A. Lockwood, Suzanne M. Fielding</p>
            <p>Recoverable strain is the strain recovered once a stress is removed from a body, in the direction opposite to that in which the stress had acted. To date, the phenomenon has been understood as being elastic in origin: polymer chains stretched in the direction of an imposed stress will recoil after the stress is removed, for example. Any unrecoverable strain is instead attributed to irreversible plastic deformations. Here we study theoretically strain recovery within the soft glassy rheology model, aimed at describing the rheology of elastoplastic yield stress fluids and amorphous soft solids. We consider a material subject to the switch-on of a shear stress that is held constant before later being set back to zero, after which the strain recovery is observed. After an initially fast recoil that is indeed elastic in nature, significant further strain recovery then occurs more slowly via the plastic yielding of elements with negative local stresses, opposite to that of the original shear. We elucidate the mechanism that underlies this behaviour, in terms of the evolution of the SGR model's population of elastoplastic elements. In particular, we show that the initial fast elastic recoil brings to a state of negative local stress those elements that had yielded during the forward straining while the load was applied. The subsequent delayed plastic yielding of these elements with negative stress is the origin of the slow ongoing strain recovery. In this way, counterintuitively, elements that had yielded plastically while the load was applied still contribute significantly to strain recovery after the sample is unloaded. This finding has important consequences for constitutive modeling, because such behaviour can only arise in a constitutive model that evolves a full distribution of local stresses (or multiple moments of such a distribution), rather than a single average stress.</p>

            <p>The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</p>

            <p>The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a novel topological structure -- namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a Néel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</p>

            <p>Spin excitations play a fundamental role in understanding magnetic properties of materials, and have significant technological implications for magnonic devices. However, accurately modeling these in transition-metal and rare-earth compounds remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a fully first-principles approach for calculating spin-wave spectra based on time-dependent (TD) density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), using nonempirical Hubbard functionals. This approach is implemented in a general noncollinear formulation, enabling the study of magnons in both collinear and noncollinear magnetic systems. Unlike methods that rely on empirical Hubbard $U$ parameters to describe the ground state, and Heisenberg Hamiltonians for describing magnetic excitations, the methodology developed here probes directly the dynamical spin susceptibility (efficiently evaluated with TDDFPT throught the Liouville-Lanczos approach), and treats the linear variation of the Hubbard augmentation (in itself calculated non-empirically) in full at a self-consistent level. Furthermore, the method satisfies the Goldstone condition without requiring empirical rescaling of the exchange-correlation kernel or explicit enforcement of sum rules, in contrast to existing state-of-the-art techniques. We benchmark the novel computational scheme on prototypical transition-metal monoxides NiO and MnO, showing remarkable agreement with experiments and highlighting the fundamental role of these newly implemented Hubbard corrections. The method holds great promise for describing collective spin excitations in complex materials containing localized electronic states.</p>

And we give applications beyond thermal baths -- such as networks in ecology, biochemistry, vehicle traffic, and other force-flow networks. Beyond past work on inequalities, it gives equalities; and it gives forces, which allows for studies of optimization, conflicts, congestion and network design; and it gives a third Kirchhoff-like relation that applies to networks that have fluctuating flows.</p>

            <p>Charge density wave (CDW) orders in YNiC2 are studied by means of combined experimental and computational techniques. On the experimental side, single crystals grown by the floating-zone method were examined by means of X-ray diffraction, as well as transport and thermal techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations founded on the experimentally determined parent and CDW-modified crystal structures provide details of electronic and phononic structures as well as electron-phonon coupling and resolve changes inflicted upon entering the different CDW phases. Thereby, contrasting effects of subsequently emerging CDW states characterized by incommensurate q_{1ic} and commensurate q_{2c} modulation vectors are revealed. The former state, on-setting below T_{1ic}~ 305 K, weakly modifies the electronic structure by opening an almost isotropic gap on a minor part of the Fermi surface (FS). The latter phase, which takes over below T_{2c}~ 272 K has a more pronounced impact on physical properties via a decomposition of larger parts of the FS. These dissimilar behaviors are directly reflected in the electronic transport anisotropy, which is significantly weakened in the q_{2c}-type CDW state. As revealed by our DFT studies, CDW phases are very close in energy and their origin is directly related to the anisotropy of electron-phonon coupling, which is linked to a specific orbital character of related FS sheets. Specific heat and thermal expansion studies reveal a nearly reversible first-order phase transition at around T_{2c}~ 272 K, where both CDW phases co-exist within a T-interval of about 10 K.</p>

Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</p>

            <p>Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a modular automated virtualization system (MAViS) -- a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multilayer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.</p>

            <h2>Why Grain Growth is Not Curvature Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caihao Qiu, David J. Srolovitz, Gregory S. Rohrer, Jian Han, Marco Salvalaglio</p>
            <p>Grain growth in polycrystals is traditionally considered a capillarity-driven process, where grain boundaries (GBs) migrate toward their centers of curvature (i.e., mean curvature flow) with a velocity proportional to the local curvature (including extensions to account for anisotropic GB energy and mobility). Experimental and simulation evidence shows that this simplistic view is untrue. We demonstrate that the failure of the classical mean curvature flow description of grain growth mainly originates from the shear deformation naturally coupled with GB motion (i.e., shear coupling). Our findings are built on large-scale microstructure evolution simulations incorporating the fundamental (crystallography-respecting) microscopic mechanism of GB migration. The nature of the deviations from curvature flow revealed in our simulations is consistent with observations in recent experimental studies on different materials. This work also demonstrates how to incorporate the mechanical effects that are essential to the accurate prediction of microstructure evolution.</p>

            <h2>Accuracy of time-dependent GGE under weak dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Lumia, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Jérôme Dubail, Mario Collura</p>
            <p>Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.</p>

            <p>Mixed anion halide-chalcogenide materials have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, making them promising candidates for various applications. Among these, CuBiSeCl_2 has recently been experimentally identified with remarkably low lattice thermal conductivity (k_L). In this study, we employ Wigner transport theory combined with neuroevolution machine learning potential (NEP)-assisted self-consistent phonon calculations to unravel the microscopic origins of this low k_L. Our findings reveal that the delocalization and weak bonding of copper atoms are key contributors to the strong phonon anharmonicity and wavelike tunneling (random walk diffusons). These insights deepen our understanding of the relationship between bonding characteristics, anharmonicity, delocalization, and vibrational dynamics, paving the way for the design and optimization of CuBiSeCl_2 and analogous materials for advanced phonon engineering applications.</p>

            <p>Integrating In-Ga-Zn-oxide (IGZO) channel transistors in silicon-based ecosystems requires the resilience of the channel material to hydrogen treatment. Standard IGZO, containing 40% In (metal ratio) suffers from degradation under forming gas anneal (FGA) and hydrogen (H) driven positive bias temperature instability (PBTI). We demonstrate scaled top-gated ALD transistors with an In-poor (In $\le$ 17%) IGZO channel that show superior resilience to hydrogen compared to the In-rich (In=40%) counterpart. The devices, fabricated with a 300-mm FAB process with dimensions down to $W_\mathrm{CH} \times L_\mathrm{TG} = 80 \times 40 \mathrm{nm}^2$, show excellent stability in 2-hour 420$^\circ$C forming gas anneal ($0.06 \le \left| \Delta V_{\mathrm{TH}} \right| \le 0.33\mathrm{V}$) and improved resilience to H in PBTI at 125$^\circ$C (down to no detectable H-induced $V_{\mathrm{TH}}$ shift) compared to In-rich devices. We demonstrate that the device degradation by H in the FGA is different from the H-induced VTH instability in PBTI, namely oxygen scavenging by H and H release from a gate-dielectric into the channel, respectively, and that resilience to H in one process does not automatically translate to resilience to H in the other one. This significant improvement in IGZO resilience to H enables the use of FGA treatments during fabrication needed for silicon technology compatibility, as well as further scaling and 3D integration, bringing IGZO-based technologies closer to mass production.</p>

            <h2>Néel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metal CrSb</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianye Yu, Ijaz Shahid, Peitao Liu, Xing-Qiu Chen, Yan Sun</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the Néel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the Néel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the Néel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the Néel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Mathematical analysis of a flux-jump model in superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Guy Caputo, Nathan Rouxelin</p>
            <p>Type II superconductors can trap a transient magnetic field and become "cryomagnets" that are very useful for applications. During this process, flux jumps i.e. sudden jumps of the total magnetization occur and hinder the properties of these magnets. To understand the electrodynamics of these systems and in particular flux jumps, we analyzed mathematically a model based on Maxwell's equations and temperature in a 1D configuration. When a magnetic pulse is applied to a superconductor, three effects occur, from fastest to slowest: Joule heating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the problem, we obtain a nonlinear diffusion for the magnetic field coupled to a forced diffusion equation for the temperature with only two parameters. Two regimes occur, depending on temperature: for medium temperature the heat capacity of a sample can be assumed constant while for low temperature it depends on temperature causing a nonlinear temperature evolution. Flux jumps can be explained using the fixed points of the equations. We found that they occur for pulses of duration close to the magnetic relaxation time and mostly at low temperature because of the nonlinear dependance. Flux trapping is maximal for medium amplitude long duration pulses and low to medium temperatures, so these conditions are optimal to produce better cryomagnets.</p>

            <p>From nanoscale devices including sensors, electronics, or biocompatible coatings to macroscale structural, automotive or aerospace components, fundamental understanding of plasticity and fracture can guide the realization of materials that ensure safe and durable performance. Identifying the role of atomic-scale plasticity is crucial, especially for applications relying on brittle ceramics. Here, stress-intensity-controlled atomistic simulations of fracture in cubic Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N model systems demonstrate how $\overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$-scale plasticity - manifested as lattice distortions, phase transformation, nucleation and emission of dislocations - substantially affects the macroscale fracture toughness (K$_{Ic}$) and fracture strength (${\sigma}$$_{f}$) of brittle ceramics. The extent of plastic deformation in Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N increases monotonically with the Al content (x), due to a corresponding decrease in cubic $\rightarrow$ hexagonal polymorph transition energies and unstable stacking fault energies. Overall, plasticity positively affects the mechanical properties, resulting in optimal combinations of strength and toughness for x~0.6. However, for x exceeding ~0.7, the benefits of plasticity diminish. The initial rise followed by a decline in K$_{Ic}$(x) and ${\sigma}$$_{f}$(x) is explained based on the interplay between phase transformation, shear-induced faulting, and tensile cleavage on the easiest fracture plane. The results highlight the impact of atomic-scale plasticity on observable properties and point to strategies for toughening ceramics through control of polymorph competition.</p>

            <h2>Reduced Wannier representation for topological bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Trey Cole, David Vanderbilt</p>
            <p>Bands with non-trivial topological indices have a topological obstruction preventing them from being represented by exponentially localized Wannier states. Here, we propose a procedure to construct exponentially localized Wannier functions that span a subspace of topologically obstructed bands through the use of the projection method. These Wannier functions form what we refer to as a "reduced Wannier representation," indicating that the Wannier functions necessarily do not span the full topological manifold. By constructing supercells, we obtain reduced Wannier functions that break the primitive translational symmetry while capturing a substantial portion of the topologically obstructed manifold. This approach effectively decomposes the topological manifold into two subspaces: an itinerant subspace inheriting the topology and a localized trivial subspace represented by reduced Wannier functions. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele tight-binding models as the platforms for our investigation.</p>

            <h2>Universality in the microwave shielding of ultracold polar molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joy Dutta, Bijit Mukherjee, Jeremy M. Hutson</p>
            <p>Microwave shielding is an important technique that can suppress the losses that arise from collisions of ultracold polar molecules. It has been instrumental in achieving molecular Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for NaCs [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We demonstrate that microwave shielding is universal, in the sense that the 2-body collision properties of different molecules are very similar when expressed in suitable reduced units of length and energy. This applies to rate coefficients for inelastic scattering and loss, to scattering lengths, and to the properties of 2-molecule bound states. We also explore the small deviations from universality that arise at very large Rabi frequencies. In general, the collision properties are near-universal except when the Rabi frequency exceeds a few percent of the molecular rotational constant. The universality extends to elliptically polarized microwaves and to combinations of multiple fields. Our results indicate that the methods that have been used to achieve BEC for NaCs can be transferred directly to most other polar molecules.</p>

            <p>Ab initio based accurate simulation of phonon-assisted optical spectra of semiconductors at finite temperatures remains a formidable challenge, as it requires large supercells for phonon sampling and computationally expensive high-accuracy exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. In this work, we present an efficient approach that combines deep learning tight-binding and potential models to address this challenge with ab initio fidelity. By leveraging molecular dynamics for atomic configuration sampling and deep learning-enabled rapid Hamiltonian evaluation, our approach enables large-scale simulations of temperature-dependent optical properties using advanced XC functionals (HSE, SCAN). Demonstrated on silicon and gallium arsenide across temperature 100-400 K, the method accurately captures phonon-induced bandgap renormalization and indirect/direct absorption processes which are in excellent agreement with experimental findings over five orders of magnitude. This work establishes a pathway for high-throughput investigation of electron-phonon coupled phenomena in complex materials, overcoming traditional computational limitations arising from large supercell used with computationally expensive XC-functionals.</p>

            <p>Physical reservoir computing has emerged as a powerful framework for exploiting the inherent nonlinear dynamics of physical systems to perform computational tasks. Recently, we presented the magnon-scattering reservoir, whose internal nodes are given by the fundamental wave-like excitations of ferromagnets called magnons. These excitations can be geometrically-quantized and, in response to an external stimulus, show transient nonlinear scattering dynamics that can be harnessed to perform memory and nonlinear transformation tasks. Here, we test a magnon-scattering reservoir in a single magnetic disk in the vortex state towards two key performance indicators for physical reservoir computing, the short-term memory and parity-check tasks. Using time-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy, we measure the evolution of the reservoir's spectral response to an input sequence consisting of random binary inputs encoded in microwave pulses with two distinct frequencies. Two different output spaces of the reservoir are defined, one based on the time-averaged frequency spectra and another based on temporal multiplexing. Our results demonstrate that the memory and nonlinear transformation capability do not depend on the chosen read-out scheme as long as the dimension of the output space is large enough to capture all nonlinear features provided by the magnon-magnon interactions. This further shows that solely the nonlinear magnons in the physical system, not the read-out, determine the reservoir's capacity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debjani Das Gupta, Santanu K. Maiti</p>
            <p>We propose, for the first time, that an array of diamond plaquettes, each possessing vanishing net magnetization, can achieve complete spin polarization over a broad bias window. Furthermore, this system can be utilized to realize spin-specific semiconducting behavior. We describe the antiferromagnetic diamond network within a tight-binding framework, where spin-dependent scattering arises due to the interaction between itinerant electrons and local magnetic moments at different lattice sites. The mechanism underlying spin filtration relies on the specific arrangement of magnetic moments within individual plaquettes. We systematically investigate the spin polarization phenomenon under various input conditions, examining its dependence on network size, system temperature, and the magnetic flux threading each plaquette. Due to the network's geometry, we identify a sharply localized, highly degenerate energy level coexisting with conducting states. By tuning physical parameters, a small energy gap can be established between these degenerate localized states and the conducting energy band, enabling spin-specific $p$-type and $n$-type semiconducting behavior. Our findings offer a novel approach for designing future spintronic devices based on similar antiferromagnetic networks.</p>

Here, we explore the excitation spectrum of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to an optical cavity and pumped by an optical standing wave, which simulates the famous Dicke-Hepp-Lieb phase transition of the open Dicke model with dissipation arising due to photon leakage from the cavity. For weak dissipation, the excitation spectrum displays two strongly polaritonic modes. Close to the phase boundary, we observe an intriguing regime where the lower-energetic of these modes, instead of showing the expected roton-type mode softening, is found to approach and persist at zero energy, well before the critical pump strength for the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb transition boundary is reached. Hence, a peculiar situation arises, where an excitation is possible at zero energy cost, but nevertheless no instability of the system is created.</p>

Moreover, pyroelectric current measurements show LiNO$_3$ to be ferroelectric with an electric polarization of $P$ = 1,200 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Both $\epsilon$' and $P$ are amongst one of the highest in all known materials.

            <p>Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) are a leading candidate for advanced memory and computing applications. Epitaxial-like growth of chalcogenide thin films at the wafer scale is important to guarantee the homogeneity of the thin film but is challenging with magnetron sputtering, particularly for the growth of phase-change heterostructure (PCH), such as TiTe2/Sb2Te3. In this work, we report how to obtain highly textured TiTe2/Sb2Te3 heterostructure thin films with atomically sharp interfaces on standard silicon substrates. By combining atomic-scale characterization and ab initio simulations, we reveal the critical role of the Sb2Te3 seed layer in forming a continuous Si-Sb-Te mixed transition layer, which provides a wafer-scale flat surface for the subsequent epitaxial-like growth of TiTe2/Sb2Te3 thin film. By gradually reducing the thickness of the seed layer, we determine its critical limit to be ~2 nm. Non-negligible in-plane tensile strain was observed in the TiTe2 slabs due to the lattice mismatch with the adjacent Sb2Te3 ones, suggesting that the chemical interaction across the structural gaps in the heterostructure is stronger than a pure van der Waals interaction. Finally, we outline the potential choices of chalcogenides for atomically flat seed layers on standard silicon substrates, which can be used for wafer-scale synthesis of other high-quality PCM or PCH thin films.</p>

            <p>Recent studies propose Majorana polarization (MP) as a tool for identifying topological Majorana bound states (MBS). We analyze MP in two systems: a one-dimensional (1d) semiconducting nanowire and a quasi-1d system, both with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, proximity-induced superconductivity, and disorder. While MP reflects topological features, it does not always distinguish true MBS from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or quasi-Majorana modes. True MBS are expected to satisfy $\mathcal{P}^*_\mathrm{left} \cdot \mathcal{P}_\mathrm{right} \sim -1$, but two additional criteria - a topological bandgap and edge-localized wavefunctions - are also necessary for their identification and use in topological quantum computation (TQC). We highlight cases where the polarization product condition holds without meeting these extra requirements. Our conclusions remain robust irrespective of the chosen definition of Majorana polarization, whether based on chiral or the particle-hole framework. Robust MBS identification for TQC demands combining MP with energy spectra and wavefunction localization, especially in disordered systems.</p>

            <p>Measurements are fundamental to knowledge creation in science, enabling consistent sharing of findings and serving as the foundation for scientific discovery. As machine learning systems increasingly transform scientific fields, the question of how to effectively evaluate these systems becomes crucial for ensuring reliable progress. In this review, we examine the current state and future directions of evaluation frameworks for machine learning in science. We organize the review around a broadly applicable framework for evaluating machine learning systems through the lens of statistical measurement theory, using materials science as our primary context for examples and case studies. We identify key challenges common across machine learning evaluation such as construct validity, data quality issues, metric design limitations, and benchmark maintenance problems that can lead to phantom progress when evaluation frameworks fail to capture real-world performance needs. By examining both traditional benchmarks and emerging evaluation approaches, we demonstrate how evaluation choices fundamentally shape not only our measurements but also research priorities and scientific progress. These findings reveal the critical need for transparency in evaluation design and reporting, leading us to propose evaluation cards as a structured approach to documenting measurement choices and limitations. Our work highlights the importance of developing a more diverse toolbox of evaluation techniques for machine learning in materials science, while offering insights that can inform evaluation practices in other scientific domains where similar challenges exist.</p>

            <p>We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helical spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helical graphene structures. We model the helical graphene surface as a smooth, continuous, and distortion-free manifold, effectively adopting the continuum approximation. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helical background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helical pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helical graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</p>

            <p>The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in materials has long been a topic of debate. Studies reveal that AHC originates from the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) of Bloch states. Accurate computation of AHC is crucial for predicting material properties and guiding experimental studies in topological and spintronic applications. Traditional approaches often rely on wannier interpolation, which can introduce inaccuracies and computational overhead. Also, reliability of the wannierization technique becomes questionable when the bands are highly entangled and dispersive. This demands the calculation of AHC using the $\textit{first-principle}$ approach. Here, we present $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$, a Python 3 based code that directly computes $\boldsymbol\Omega$ and AHC using WIEN2k output. Since, WIEN2k employs an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method, $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$ provides highly accurate AHC results. The code efficiently handles large $\textbf{k}$-grids by parallelizing $\boldsymbol\Omega$ computations over $\textbf{k}$-points. Also, it stores band-resolved $\boldsymbol\Omega$ in a binary file, thereby greatly reducing the required storage memory and allowing fast post-processing to compute AHC. $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$ has been validated on well-known materials exhibiting AHC. These include- Fe, Fe$_3$Ge & Co$_2$FeAl. At 300 K, the calculated magnitude of $\sigma_{xy}$ for Fe & Fe$_3$Ge is found to be 744 $S/cm$ & 311 $S/cm$, respectively. For Co$_2$FeAl, the magnitude of $\sigma_{xy}$ is obtained to be $\sim$56 $S/cm$ and is found to be constant with the change in temperature from 0-300 K. These results are in good agreement with previously reported theoretical and experimental data. This ensures the accuracy, reliability and efficiency of the code. The code is also provided with a post-processing tool to visualize $\boldsymbol\Omega$.</p>

            <h2>Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Semra Gurtas Dogan, Kobra Hasanirokh, Omar Mustafa, Abdullah Guvendi</p>
            <p>This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bastián Pradenas, Grigor Adamyan, Oleg Tchernyshyov</p>
            <p>We present a detailed investigation of an overlooked symmetry structure in non-collinear antiferromagnets that gives rise to an emergent quantum number for magnons. Focusing on the triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we show that its spin order parameter transforms under an enlarged symmetry group, $\mathrm{SO(3)_L \times SO(2)_R}$, rather than the conventional spin-rotation group $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. Although this larger symmetry is spontaneously broken by the ground state, a residual subgroup survives, leading to conserved Noether charges that, upon quantization, endow magnons with an additional quantum number -- \emph{isospin} -- beyond their energy and momentum. Our results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding symmetry, degeneracy, and quantum numbers in non-collinear magnetic systems, and bridge an unexpected connection between the paradigms of symmetry breaking in non-collinear antiferromagnets and chiral symmetry breaking in particle physics.</p>

            <p>Scaling of transistors has enabled continuous improvements in logic device performance, especially through materials engineering. However, surpassing horizontal limitations in chip manufacturing requires a vertical, third dimension. Three-dimensional integration of high-performance logic demands solving the challenge of low-temperature (less than 450°C) synthesis of high-mobility n-type and p-type semiconductor thin films for back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible transistors. Metal oxides, particularly indium oxides alloyed with gallium and tungsten, are promising n-type channel materials, but suitable p-type materials for BEOL remain scarce. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a wide band-gap semiconductor, shows room-temperature p-type conductivity when doped with copper and crystallizes below 400°C. Here, we report growth of crystalline ZnS thin films by pulsed laser deposition on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces including silicon nitride, thermal silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium dioxide, sapphire, platinum, and titanium nitride. X-ray diffraction reveals out-of-plane texturing across all surfaces, while grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering probes in-plane crystalline quality. Surface and interface properties are assessed using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Electrical characterization via J-V measurements (ZnS on Pt) and metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (ZnS on silicon dioxide) measurements show low leakage current ($10^{-5} A/cm^2$ at 0.40 MV/cm) and bilayer capacitor behavior, suggesting ZnS is highly intrinsic with minimal electrically active defects. Further work on doping ZnS with copper or other p-type elements is needed to realize ZnS as a dopable wide band-gap semiconductor for BEOL integration. This work demonstrates a novel thin-film growth method for sulfide semiconductors under BEOL-compatible conditions.</p>

            <p>We investigate emergent superconductivity and non-reciprocal transport (magnetochiral anisotropy, superconducting diode effect) at the heterointerface of two non-superconducting van der Waals (vdW) materials, the Dirac semimetal ZrTe$_2$ and the antiferromagnetic iron chalcogenide FeTe, grown using molecular beam epitaxy. We show from electrical transport measurements that two dimensional (2D) superconductivity arises at the heterointerface below temperature $T \sim 12$~K. When capped with a 2D ferromagnet (CrTe$_2$), these heterostructures show a superconducting diode effect with efficiency of about 30\%. With strong spin-orbit coupling in ZrTe$_2$, these epitaxial heterostructures provide an attractive epitaxial vdW platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity in Dirac semimetals and for developing non-reciprocal devices for superconducting electronics.</p>

            <h2>Effect of interatomic repulsion on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clara Palacios, Armando A. Aligia</p>
            <p>We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a "sweet spot" hosting "poor man's Majorana" states can still be achieved in the presence of $V$ by appropriately tuning the system parameters. This adjustment allows the extension of previous results to the case of finite Coulomb repulsion $V \neq 0$. However, we observe modifications in the microwave spectrum, due to the presence of previously overlooked states. Additionally, we find that at the sweet spot of both DQDs, all eigenstates of the transmon system exhibit exact double degeneracy.</p>

            <p>The ionic conductivity of a nanofluidic channel is one of its most basic properties, which is systematically characterized in experiments. While most studies to date have focused on the DC conductivity, there has recently been a surge of interest in the behavior of nanochannels under AC voltages. Here, we show that in nanochannels with electrically conducting walls, electrons can contribute to transporting ionic current through the channel. We identify a critical frequency and lengthscale above which electrons in the channel walls become the main charge carriers, resulting in a strongly increased conductivity. Our findings open the way to the engineering of nanofluidic functionalities based on ion-electron coupling.</p>

            <p>The charged exotic mesons Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) observed by the Belle collaboration in 2011 are very close to the B* Bbar and B* Bbar* thresholds, respectively. This suggests their interpretation as shallow hadronic molecules of B and B* mesons. Using the masses of the Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) as input, we rule out the possibility for universal bound states of three B and B* mesons arising from the Efimov effect based on their spin-isospin structure. As a consequence, we can predict the phase shifts for the scattering of B and B* mesons off the exotic mesons Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) to leading order in a non-relativistic effective field theory with contact interactions based on two-body information alone.</p>

            <h2>Universal Acceleration of Quantum Relaxation by Reset-Induced Mpemba Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruicheng Bao, Zhonghuai Hou</p>
            <p>Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a universal quantum reset protocol that enables exponential acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems. The protocol induces a quantum Mpemba effect, wherein systems initialized farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to it, and crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol eliminates multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling quantum relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.</p>

            <h2>Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johann Ostmeyer, Pavel Buividovich</p>
            <p>The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</p>

            <p>We calculate the correlation functions of strings of spin operators for integrable quantum circuits exactly. These observables can be used for calibration of quantum simulation platforms. We use algebraic Bethe Ansatz, in combination with computational algebraic geometry to obtain analytic results for medium-size (around 10-20 qubits) quantum circuits. The results are rational functions of the quantum circuit parameters. We obtain analytic results for such correlation functions both in the real space and Fourier space. In the real space, we analyze the short time and long time limit of the correlation functions. In Fourier space, we obtain analytic results in different parameter regimes, which exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. Using these analytic results, one can easily generate numerical data to arbitrary precision.</p>

            <p>Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes scattered optical field and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.</p>

            <p>We develop a theoretical framework to describe how zero-photon detection may be utilized to enhance laser cooling via the anti-Stokes interaction and, somewhat surprisingly, enable cooling via the Stokes interaction commonly associated with heating. Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous-measurement-induced dynamics, contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, we explore the interplay between cooling and heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, and we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D. Major, et al., arXiv:2408.01734 (2024)], which demonstrated enhanced laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes signal. The framework developed here provides new approaches for cooling mechanical resonators that can be applied to a wide range of areas including nonclassical state preparation, quantum thermodynamics, and avoiding the often unwanted heating effects of parametric amplification.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matija Medvidović, Jaylyn C. Umana, Iman Ahmadabadi, Domenico Di Sante, Johannes Flick, Angel Rubio</p>
            <p>Density functional theory (DFT) offers a desirable balance between quantitative accuracy and computational efficiency in practical many-electron calculations. Its central component, the exchange-correlation energy functional, has been approximated with increasing levels of complexity ranging from strictly local approximations to nonlocal and orbital-dependent expressions with many tuned parameters. In this paper, we formulate a general way of rewriting complex density functionals using deep neural networks in a way that allows for simplified computation of Kohn-Sham potentials as well as higher functional derivatives through automatic differentiation, enabling access to highly nonlinear response functions and forces. These goals are achieved by using a recently developed class of robust neural network models capable of modeling functionals, as opposed to functions, with explicitly enforced spatial symmetries. Functionals treated in this way are then called global density approximations and can be seamlessly integrated with existing DFT workflows. Tests are performed for a dataset featuring a large variety of molecular structures and popular meta-generalized gradient approximation density functionals, where we successfully eliminate orbital dependencies coming from the kinetic energy density, and discover a high degree of transferability to a variety of physical systems. The presented framework is general and could be extended to more complex orbital and energy dependent functionals as well as refined with specialized datasets.</p>

            <p>A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schrödinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range.

            <p>Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by Lüscher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</p>

We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information.

            <p>In financial market microstructure, there are two enigmatic empirical laws: (i) the market-order flow has predictable persistence due to metaorder splitters by institutional investors, well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. However, this phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii) the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. Here we theoretically reveal why price dynamics follows Brownian motion despite predictable order flow by unifying these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable Lévy-walk model. Our exact solution shows that the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under persistent order flow. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in mitigating large price movements by large metaorders, thereby leading to the Brownian price dynamics, consistently with the efficient market hypothesis over long timescales.</p>

Next, we demonstrate that the scheme can accurately recover the density of states, which in turn allows for calculating expectation values in the conjugate ensemble, e.g., at a fixed temperature. The method can thus be used to advance the state-of-the-art characterization of physical systems that admit a QUBO-based representation and that are otherwise intractable with real-space sampling methods. A case in point are space-filling melts of lattice ring polymers, recently mapped in QUBO form, for which our method reveals that the ring catenation probability is non-monotonic with the bending rigidity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin Falls</p>
            <p>For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.</p>

This step is hindered by the lack of an experiment that can directly interrogate the interactions and the specific quasiparticles involved in the interaction simultaneously. We introduce correlation-ARPES (C-ARPES) as a new experimental method that overcomes this difficulty and directly measures the interactions between specific, chosen quasiparticles by measuring the correlations between two electrons photoemitted from the same pulse (but not the same photon). We illustrate how this technique can extract the underlying interactions, and demonstrate this with an example of phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions, such as those that give rise to charge density waves through the Kohn anomaly mechanism.</p>

            <p>Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states - fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states realized without an external magnetic field - in twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers represents a significant development in condensed matter physics. Notably, these states were first observed via photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Surprisingly, a general theoretical understanding of PL is not available even for the standard FQH states. For an ideal two-dimensional system, the energy of the emitted photon is predicted to be independent of the correlations, but we show that the PL intensity contains valuable information. Specifically, we predict that at finite temperatures, the PL intensity peaks at the Jain fillings \nu = n/(2n \pm 1), and away from these fillings, the binding energies of the composite-fermion excitons and trions can be deduced from the temperature dependence of the intensity. We discuss implications for PL experiments in semiconductor quantum wells and twisted TMD bilayers.</p>

            <h2>Polarization-Driven Charge Frustration and Emergent Phases in the One-Dimensional Extended Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourabh Saha, Jeroen van den Brink, Manoranjan Kumar, Satoshi Nishimoto</p>
            <p>Frustration is a key driver of exotic quantum phases, yet its role in charge dynamics remains largely unexplored. We show that charge frustration - induced by electronic polarization effects - stabilizes unconventional insulating states in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model. Using exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group, we uncover a charge-disordered phase that remains insulating despite lacking long-range order and possessing an effectively attractive on-site interaction - a behavior reminiscent of gapful spin liquids in frustrated spin systems. We also identify a fragile ferroelectric phase and a charge-density-wave state with emergent eight-site periodicity. These findings establish charge frustration, driven by charge-dipole interactions, as a robust mechanism for realizing exotic phases in low-dimensional correlated systems, with implications for organic conductors, transition-metal oxides, and ultracold polar molecules.</p>

            <h2>Ferroelectrically Switchable Chirality in Topological Superconductivity: Bilayer-MnBi2Te4/Fe(Se,Te) Heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-Zhi Bai, Bo Fu, Shun-Qing Shen</p>
            <p>The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi2Te4 coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi2Te4. This sliding mechanism breaks the MzT and PT symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin-polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pardis Adams, Jan Bühler, Angel Labordet Alvarez, David Tilley, and Mirjana Dimitrievska</p>
            <p>Molybdenum sulfide clusters, [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, have emerged as key molecular models for understanding active sites in Mo-S-based catalysts and as promising candidates for energy conversion applications. Despite their importance, comprehensive vibrational characterization of these clusters remains limited. Here, we present a detailed Raman and infrared spectroscopic analysis of both clusters, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. High-quality crystalline samples were synthesized and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to confirm morphology and stoichiometry. Raman spectra, acquired using 488 nm and 532 nm laser excitation, were deconvoluted using Lorentzian fitting. Vibrational mode assignments were made through direct comparison with DFT predictions. For [Mo3S4]4+, major Raman bands appear near 200 cm^-1, 350 cm^-1, and 450 cm^-1, corresponding to Mo-S-Mo bending, Mo-S stretching, and terminal sulfur vibrations. [Mo3S13]2- shows two distinct spectral regions: 100-400 cm^-1 for Mo-S and S-S bending and stretching, and 450-550 cm^-1 for terminal disulfide (S-S) stretching. Complementary IR spectra calculations reveal additional vibrational features, yielding a more complete fingerprint for each cluster. Finally, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy offers greater sensitivity than X-ray diffraction (XRD) in detecting these clusters on supporting materials. This work provides a detailed vibrational reference for [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, establishing Raman and IR spectroscopy as powerful tools for characterizing Mo-S molecular clusters in both fundamental and applied contexts.</p>

            <h2>Learning simple heuristic rules for classifying materials based on chemical composition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Ma, Marin Soljačić</p>
            <p>In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table. For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks, we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of test accuracy.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Theory of Unusual Anisotropic Magnetoresistance and Unidirectional Magnetoresistance in Nanoscale Bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> X. R. Wang</p>
            <p>Nanoscale bilayers containing at least one magnetic layer exhibit universal unusual anisotropic magnetoresistance (UAMR) and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR). They are currently understood through various mechanisms related to the interconversion of charge current and spin current, giant magnetoresistance, thermal magnonic effects, thermoelectric effects, and diverse spindependent scattering processes. This raises a fundamental question: do the universal behaviors observed in a wide range of systems stem from underlying general principles? We demonstrate here that both UAMR and UMR arise from electron transport influenced by the magnetization vector present in the magnetic material and the interfacial potential inherent in heterostructures. Specifically, UAMR represents current-independent resistance (resistivity) of bilayers. UMR is the resistance proportional to the current although electron transports of the bilayers are the linear response to high current densities and their induced thermal gradients. Our theory introduces a novel approach that considers the interplay between the magnetization vector, thermal gradients, and the effective internal electric field at the interface. This framework provides a unified explanation for both UMR and UAMR, effectively capturing key experimental features such as dependence on current direction, magnetization orientation, film thickness, and magnetic field strength. Furthermore, it offers a universal perspective that bridges UMR and UAMR effects, enhancing our understanding of spin-dependent transport phenomena in bilayers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Zhang, Houssem Rezgui, Meng Lian, Hong Liang</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium transport and phonon branch-resolved size effects in single-layer graphene materials are studied under a multi-temperature kinetic model, which is developed for capturing the branch-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Compared with typical macroscopic multi-temperature models, the assumption of diffusive phonon transport is abandoned in this model and replaced by the free migration and scattering of particles. The phonon branch- and size-dependent effective thermal conductivity is predicted in nanosized graphene as well as the temperature slips near the boundaries. Compared with other phonon branches, the ZA branch contributes the most to thermal conduction regardless of system sizes. Furthermore, in nanosized homogeneous graphene with a hotspot at the center, the branch-dependent thermal conductivity increases from the inside to the outside even if the system size is fixed. The thermal conductivity of ZA branch is even higher than the lattice thermal conductivity when the system size is hundreds of nanometers.</p>

            <h2>Molecular-sized bubbles in a liquid: free energy of formation beyond the capillarity approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Puibasset</p>
            <p>We investigate the transient bubbles that spontaneously appear in a simple liquid using molecular simulations. The objective is to deduce the free-energy of formation of the bubbles $W(s)$ from the bubble size distribution $p(s)$ through the hypothesis of a Boltzmann distribution: $W(s) = -kT \ln p(s)$. The bubbles are detected and characterized using a method based on a grid superimposed on the liquid, efficient for bubbles larger than the grid mesh. We first investigate how the results are affected by the mesh choice, and show that using several mesh values allows to detect bubbles in a wide range of sizes with minimal computing cost. The free-energy of formation of a bubble can then be deduced for a large range of sizes, with particular emphasis in the region of vanishing bubbles scarcely investigated in previous works. We first show that the usual Boltzmann relation has to be modified when the bubble size is characterized by its volume. In particular, the bubble volume distribution diverges for a vanishing bubble, which should be taken into account before calculating its free-energy of formation from the above formula. An analytical expansion, valid for any interacting spherical molecules, confirms this observation. We then show that the capillarity approximation fails for small bubbles: an extra contribution, linear with the bubble radius, has to be added to the usual quadratic (surface) and cubic (volume) contributions to the free-energy. This extra term most probably relates to the irregular shape of the tiny bubbles.</p>

In particular, enhancements of the gating times by two orders of magnitude are obtained in slightly elongated quantum dots. We show that, depending on the confinement anisotropy, such an enhancement is driven either by the occupation of excited spin-orbitals (Pauli principle), or by a Coulomb-induced charge rearrangement.</p>

This approach offers a unified framework for investigating phase transitions in such complex systems. The associated critical exponents are estimated via finite-size scaling analysis and show good agreement with established values.</p>

            <p>The integration of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with ferroelectric substrates is a powerful strategy to modulate their electronic and optical properties. However, the use of relaxor ferroelectrics for this purpose remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a reversible photoluminescence (PL) and charge density modulation of monolayer $MoS_{2}$ on a $Sr_{0.61}Ba_{0.39}Nb_{2}O_{6}$ (SBN) substrate, a prototypical relaxor ferroelectric. The smearing of the phase transition in SBN enables continuous tuning of $MoS_{2}$ electronic properties over a broad temperature range ($30-90°C$). A pronounced PL enhancement occurs as the substrate transitions from ferro-to-paraelectric phase due to the vanishing spontaneous polarization and the consequent change in charge balance at the $MoS_{2}-SBN$ interface. Moreover, thermal hysteresis in the electron density modulation is observed during heating and cooling cycles. These findings highlight the potential of relaxor ferroelectrics as reconfigurable platforms for electron doping and light-emission control in 2D materials, opening avenues for temperature-responsive optoelectronic and nanophotonic applications.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Driven Intervalley Coherence with Emergent Kekulé Orbitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua Chen</p>
            <p>The $p$-orbital doublet in a honeycomb lattice is concretely studied with interacting spinless fermions at half filling. The Dirac fermions with linear dispersion at $\pm K$ valleys govern the non-interacting low-energy physics. In the weak-coupling regime, the Dirac fermions are gaped due to the spontaneous generation of mass terms through a uniform axial orbital ordering, rendering the system into the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase with a nonzero Chern number. Surprisingly, the intermediate many-particle interaction produces the intervalley coherence between $\pm K$ valleys by developing complex polar orbital orderings in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell. This phase is shown to have a deep connection with the low-energy physical behavior described by the orbital exchange model in the Mott insulating phase. The classical ground-state manifold in the Mott regime enjoys a continuous symmetry characterized by the intervalley coherent phase. Finally, the quantum fluctuation selects a unique ground state with emergent Kekulé orbitons through the order-by-disorder mechanism. Our findings provide insights for a direction of searching for Kekulé distortion in correlated multi-orbital systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas Leimeroth, Linus C. Erhard, Karsten Albe, Jochen Rohrer</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have massively changed the field of atomistic modeling. They enable the accuracy of density functional theory in large-scale simulations while being nearly as fast as classical interatomic potentials. Over the last few years, a wide range of different types of MLIPs have been developed, but it is often difficult to judge which approach is the best for a given problem setting. For the case of structurally and chemically complex solids, namely Al-Cu-Zr and Si-O, we benchmark a range of machine learning interatomic potential approaches, in particular, the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP), high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNP), moment tensor potentials (MTP), the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) in its linear and nonlinear version, neural equivariant interatomic potentials (NequIP), Allegro, and MACE. We find that nonlinear ACE and the equivariant, message-passing graph neural networks NequIP and MACE form the Pareto front in the accuracy vs. computational cost trade-off. In case of the Al-Cu-Zr system we find that MACE and Allegro offer the highest accuracy, while NequIP outperforms them for Si-O. Furthermore, GPUs can massively accelerate the MLIPs, bringing them on par with and even ahead of non-accelerated classical interatomic potentials (IPs) with regards to accessible timescales. Finally, we explore the extrapolation behavior of the corresponding potentials, probe the smoothness of the potential energy surfaces, and finally estimate the user friendliness of the corresponding fitting codes and molecular dynamics interfaces.</p>

Rather than focusing on specific parameter choices, we study ensembles of systems where the inter-species interaction coefficients and average densities are sampled from probability distributions. We show that non-reciprocity stabilizes the homogeneous mixed state even in the presence of compositional disorder. Using random matrix theory, we derive a general condition for the onset of spinodal instability, which we verify through simulations. Finally, we illustrate the connection between the statistics of the most unstable eigenvalue and the emergent nonlinear dynamics.</p>

            <p>We introduce a computationally efficient screening for the Coulomb potential that also allows calculating approximated long-range exact exchange contributions with an accuracy similar to an explicit full-range evaluation of the exact exchange. Starting from the screening function of the HSE functional, i.e., the complementary error function, as zeroth order, a first-order Taylor expansion in terms of the screening parameter {\omega} is proposed as an approximation of the long-range Coulomb potential. The resulting extended screening function has a similar spatial extend as the complementary error function leading to a computational speed comparable to screened hybrid functionals such as HSE06, but with long-range exact exchange contributions included. The approach is tested and demonstrated for prototypical semiconductors and organic crystals using the PBE0 functional. Predicted energy band gaps, total energies, cohesive energies, and lattice energies from the first-order approximated PBE0 functional are close to those from the unmodified PBE0 functional, but are obtained at significantly reduced computational cost.</p>

            <p>Here, we have studied the temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient (S) of the NaCo$_2$O$_4$ (NCO) by using experimental and computational methods. The range of experimentally obtained S is $\sim$55 to 103 $\mu$V/K in the temperature range of 300-600 K, which confirms the p-type behaviour of NCO. The electronic structure of this compound is obtained via DFT+U formalism. The band dispersion and partial density of states confirms the magnetic and half metallic nature. Furthermore, in the transport properties, the obtained S using a U = 4 eV gives the best match with experimental data. The temperature and chemical potential dependent S$^{2}$$\sigma$$/$$\tau$ is calculated using the obtained electronic transport properties, in which the maximum value obtained for p(n)-type doping is $\sim$22(61)$\times$10$^1$$^4$ $\mu$WK$^{-2}$cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. The possibility of enhancing the ZT is identified, and it is calculated in temperature range 300-1200 K. The maximum calculated value of ZT is 0.64 for p-type and 1.8 for n-type doping at 1200 K. The calculated carrier concentration obtained for p(n) type doping at 1200 K is $\sim$1.17 (1.6)$\times$10$^2$$^2$ cm$^-$$^3$. This study suggests that the careful doping of p and n type can enhance the applicability of this compound in thermoelectric for high temperature application.</p>

Along with that it has been one of the promising candidates for a quantum spin liquid state as the spins reside on a triangular lattice and it does not show any signature of magnetic ordering. We performed a thickness dependent Raman measurement in a regime of completely commensurate charge density wave (C-CDW) to a nearly commensurate charge density wave (NC-CDW) with varying temperature (4K-330K) and polarization direction of the incident light. We observed the signature of CDW transition and in addition to that we have also found the signature of a well sought hidden quantum CDW state at low temperature around TH ~ 80K. The emergence of CDW, both normal and hidden one, is marked by the emergence of new phonon modes and distinct renormalized phonon self-energy parameters for the most prominent modes. A transition from metallic to the Mott insulating state is gauged via the Raman response using low frequency slope , reflected in the renormalized slope below TCDW and TH.</p>

By studying the effect of biaxial strain on monolayer CrSi$\rm{_2}$P$\rm{_4}$ under various on-site Coulomb interactions, we reveal that this magnetic insulating state, sandwiched between the itinerant $120^{\circ}$ coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, originates from the competition between antiferromagnetic exchange and double exchange interactions of Cr 3$d$ electrons which can also be applied to account for the ground states in other chromium-based materials. Remarkably, anomalous valley Hall effect with giant valley splitting is discovered in the magnetic states of these inversion-asymmetric systems without requiring spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Our findings open a new avenue towards exploring monolayer materials for valleytronics.</p>

            <p>We report a statistical simulation of the UV-visible absorption spectrum of trans-azobenzene in ethanol solution. Due to intermolecular interactions, the used explicit solvent environment necessitates accounting for numerous transitions for a spectrum covering the two energetically lowest lines, S1 and S2. Furthermore, the spectrum manifests vast variation as a function of the underlying local structure, in conjunction with previous observations for spectra of liquids in the X-ray regime. We disentangle the complex structure-spectrum relationship using a machine learning-based method known as the emulator-based component analysis. This structural decomposition outperforms commonly used principal component analysis in explained spectral variation and reveals a small subset of latent structural variables responsible for the total spectral variance. Among other structural characteristics, blueshifting of the S2 line occurs with fewer hydrogen bonds with the ethanol solvent, and a contracted N-N bond within the C-N=N-C bridge. The observed structural dependence of the absorption spectrum thus implies an overrepresentation of certain structural classes after a photoexcitation, potentially significant for the subsequent nuclear dynamics, photophysics, and photochemistry.</p>

            <h2>Ferroelectric Properties and Topological Textures in PbTiO$_\mathrm{3}$ from a Second-Principles Open-Source interatomic potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis Bastogne, Philippe Ghosez</p>
            <p>We introduce an open-source, fully atomistic second-principles interatomic potential for lead titanate (PbTiO3), a benchmark ferroelectric material known for its strong polarization and high temperature phase transitions. While density functional theory excels at capturing atomic-scale behavior, it remains computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations required to explore complex phenomena. Our model addresses this limitation by accurately reproducing key properties of PbTiO3, including domain wall dynamics and skyrmion formation, which are known as key features to next-generation memory and energy-efficient technologies. Validated against DFT data, the model remains predictive across a wide range of conditions. It offers an accessible and efficient framework for high-accuracy large-scale simulations, allowing deeper insights into PbTiO3 and its potential applications.</p>

            <h2>Giant Gate Response of the Charge in an Electron-Lattice Condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maedeh Taheri, Jordan Teeter, Topojit Debnath, Nicholas Sesing, Tina Salguero, Roger K. Lake, Alexander A. Balandin</p>
            <p>Efficient electrical capacitive control is important for the next generation of ultra-low-power and ultra-fast electronics and energy-storage devices. Correlated electronic phases offer a powerful route to enhancing field-effect control beyond the limits of conventional capacitive gating. In such systems, modest gate voltages can couple to an order parameter, producing responses far larger than expected from the electrostatics of non-interacting carriers. It was demonstrated that electron-electron interactions, in which the exchange and correlation energies among electrons lower the chemical potential of an electron system as the electron density increases, can significantly increase the effective capacitance over its geometric capacitance value. Here, we show that the electron-lattice or electron-phonon correlations in charge density wave (CDW) condensate can lead to a giant gate response with the corresponding capacitance enhancement. This unusual phenomenon is demonstrated in the quasi-one-dimensional CDW material, where the gate-induced change in CDW charge density exceeds predictions based on geometrical gate capacitance by one to two orders of magnitude. This "giant gating" effect arises from the coupling of the electric field to the CDW electron-lattice condensate, demonstrating a mechanism for massively amplifying gate response via collective electronic behavior. We quantify the effect by determining the quantum capacitance of the CDW charge and by constructing a band diagram for the gated CDW device. The obtained results can lead to an alternative strategy for continuing the downscaling of the transistor feature size in electronic technology.</p>

            <h2>Role of Noise on Defect Formation and Correlations in a Long-Range Ising Model Under Adiabatic Driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Santanu Dhara, Suhas Gangadharaiah</p>
            <p>We study an exactly solvable long-range (LR) transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with a power-law decaying interaction characterized by a decay exponent {\alpha}. In the thermodynamic limit, the system is adiabatically driven in the presence of noise, from a paramagnetic phase with all spins down to one with all spins up. Our study examines the role of long-range interactions on the defect density, its distribution, and spin correlations, comparing noisy and noiseless scenarios. In the noiseless case, within the long-range regime, the steady-state properties are primarily influenced by modes near the k = {\pi} region. However, in the presence of noise, the dominant contributions shift to the modes near k = 0. This differs from the SR model, where previous studies have shown that modes around k = {\pi}/2 play a significant role under noisy conditions. In the absence of noise, defect density scales as $n\propto \tau_Q^{-1/2}$, implying scaling exponent independent of decay exponent. However, we find that decreasing the value of {\alpha} (i.e., increasing the range) enhances the defect density, whereas in the presence of noise, it is suppressed. In the LR regime, two-point fermionic correlators initially exhibit Gaussian decay, followed by quadratic suppression instead of power-law decay for both noisy and noiseless scenarios. Meanwhile, spin correlators, expressed as a string of fermionic operators, undergo purely exponential decay with no crossover behavior. Furthermore, our analysis of defect formation reveals the influence of LR interaction on the kink-number distribution and its cumulants.</p>

            <h2>Escaping the Krylov space during finite precision Lanczos</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Eckseler, M. Pieper, J. Schnack (Bielefeld University)</p>
            <p>The Lanczos algorithm, introduced by Cornelius Lanczos, has been known for a long time and is widely used in computational physics. While often employed to approximate extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectores of an operator, recently interest in the sequence of basis vectors produced by the algorithm rose in the context of Krylov complexity. Although it is generally accepted and partially proven that the procedure is numerically stable for approximating the eigenvalues, there are numerical problems when investigating the Krylov basis constructed via the Lanczos procedure. In this paper, we show that loss of orthogonality and the attempt of reorthoganalization fall short of understanding and addressing the problem. Instead, the numerical sequence of eigenvectors in finite precision arithmetic escapes the true vector space spanned by the exact Lanczos vectors. This poses the real threat to an interpretation in view of the operator growth hypothesis.</p>

            <p>The Gutzwiller projection of fermionic wave functions is a well-established method for generating variational wave functions describing exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We investigate the conditions under which a projected wave function constructed from fermionic partons can be rigorously shown to possess topological order. We demonstrate that these conditions can be precisely determined in the case of projected Majorana stabilizer codes. We then use matrix product states to study states that interpolate between two distinct Majorana fermion codes, one yielding a $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquid and the other a trivial polarized state upon projection. While the free-fermion states are adiabatically connected, we find that the projected states undergo a phase transition detected by the topological entanglement entropy. Our work underscores the profound impact of the Gutzwiller projection and cautions against inferring properties of quantum spin liquids solely from their unprojected counterparts.</p>

            <p>Magnetic shape-memory (MSM) Heuslers show a strong coupling between magnetic and structural characteristics, evidencing a correlation between magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties through a magnetostructural martensitic transformation. This functional aspect makes MSM Heuslers promising for integration into smart micro/nanodevices, including sensors, energy harvesters, and actuators. Controlling the martensitic microstructure, which determines the magnetic characteristics, is among the key points for optimization of the magnetic functional properties of these materials at different length scales. Here, we report a strategy for manipulating the magnetic properties of spatially confined epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films grown on Cr(001)//MgO(001) by twinning configuration engineering in the low-temperature ferromagnetic (martensitic) phase. We show how the twinning configurations in the continuous films and the micropatterned structures can be switched from Y-type (showing negligible magnetic stray field) into X-type (presenting significant magnetic stray field) by a post-annealing process. Advanced characterization techniques enable us to analyze the atomic structure and the surface quality of the annealed samples and to disentangle the twin-switching phenomenon. The martensitic microstructure engineering reported in this study introduces a simple method for promoting the magnetic stray-field contribution at the surface of Ni-Mn-Ga epitaxial thin films and micropatterns initially showing a negligible magnetic stray field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carmen Rubio-Verdú, Katharina J. Franke</p>
            <p>Fe$_2$GeTe$_3$ is a paradigmatic van der Waals magnet with the full microscopic picture of magnetic interactions still under debate. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 1.1 K to map out the low-energy physics on the surface. In agreement with previous works, we observe a spatially varying Fano lineshape that has been ascribed to a Kondo resonance. In addition, we identify a small gap of $\approx$ 5 meV width on top of the larger-energy Fano resonance. We suggest that this gap is the signature of a coherent Kondo lattice that has been proposed to originate from hybridization of a strongly dispersing and a flat band both derived from $d$ electrons of the Fe atoms in the lattice. Adding magnetic adatoms on the surface hardly influences the magnetic signatures of the substrate, indicating the robustness of the intralayer Kondo correlations against magnetic adsorbates.</p>

            <p>Noncollinear magnets with near-zero net magnetization and nontrivial bulk electronic topology hold significant promise for spintronic applications, though their scarcity necessitates purposeful design strategies. In this work, we report a topologically nontrivial electronic structure in metallic Mn_2PdIn, which crystallizes in the inverse Heusler structure and exhibits a spin-glassy ground state with quenched magnetization. The system features Weyl-type band crossings near the Fermi level and reveals a novel interplay among momentum-space nesting, orbital hybridization, and spin-orbit coupling. Comprehensive transport measurements uncover a pronounced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in Mn_2PdIn. The observed quadratic relationship between the longitudinal and anomalous Hall resistivities highlights the intrinsic Berry curvature contribution to AHE. These findings establish inverse Heusler alloys as compelling platforms for realizing noncollinear magnets that host Weyl-type semimetallic or metallic phases-combining suppressed magnetization with robust electronic transport-thereby offering a promising route toward their seamless integration into next-generation spintronic devices.</p>

Our model, stabilized by local dissipation and operating in the continuum limit, reveals exceptional points that spawn a tilted diabolical line in the dispersion. Local dissipation prevents instabilities, while a bulk anomaly signals unscreened current response. Upon opening the boundaries, we observe a non-Hermitian skin effect with localized edge modes. Through bulk winding indices and non-Bloch theory, we establish a robust bulk-boundary correspondence, highlighting parametric drives as a scalable route to non-Hermitian topology in bosonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Santos Bravo Yuste, Rubén Gómez González, Vicente Garzó</p>
            <p>We study the mean-square displacement (MSD) of a tracer particle diffusing in a granular gas of inelastic hard spheres under homogeneous cooling state (HCS). Tracer and granular gas particles are in general mechanically different. Our approach uses a series representation of the MSD where the $k$-th term is given in terms of the mean scalar product $\langle \mathbf{r}_1\cdot\mathbf{r}_k \rangle$, with $\mathbf{r}_i$ denoting the displacements of the tracer between successive collisions. We find that this series approximates a geometric series with the ratio $\Omega$. We derive an explicit analytical expression of $\Omega$ for granular gases in three dimensions, and validate it through a comparison with the numerical results obtained from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Our comparison covers a wide range of masses, sizes, and inelasticities. From the geometric series, we find that the MSD per collision is simply given by the mean-square free path of the particle divided by $1-\Omega$. The analytical expression for the MSD derived here is compared with DSMC data and with the first- and second-Sonine approximations to the MSD obtained from the Chapman-Enskog solution of the Boltzmann equation. Surprisingly, despite their simplicity, our results outperforms the predictions of the first-Sonine approximation to the MSD, achieving accuracy comparable to the second-Sonine approximation.</p>

            <h2>Van-Hove singularities and competing instabilities in an altermagnetic metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Rao, Johannes Knolle, Laura Classen</p>
            <p>Van-Hove (VH) singularities in the single-particle band spectrum are important for interaction-driven quantum phases. Whereas VH points are usually spin-degenerate, in newly proposed altermagnets VH singularities can become spin-dependent, due to momentum-dependent spin polarization of the Fermi surfaces arising from combined rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We consider two altermagnetic models ($d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave) on a square lattice with spin-polarized VH points, and study their stable fixed-point solutions indicating interaction-induced instabilities using parquet renormalization group. In particular, for the $d_{xy}$-wave model, we find new stable fixed-point solutions of the renormalization group equations which are not connected to the solution in the spin-degenerate limit. This implies that on the square lattice, the system with VH singularities is unstable with respect to altermagnetic perturbations. The leading instability for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-model is real transverse spin density wave. For the $d_{xy}$-wave model, it is found to be real transverse spin density wave at large altermagnetic splitting. At small altermagnetic splitting both imaginary charge density wave and real longitudinal spin density waves are dominant.</p>

            <p>Majorana fermions, a fundamental idea to fault-tolerant quantum computing, can emerge in systems where superconductivity coexists with nontrivial band topology. One promising route to realizing such topological superconductors (TSCs) involves inducing superconductivity in topological materials, particularly in systems lacking inversion symmetry. In this study, we report the synthesis and detailed characterization of Sn-intercalated NbSe2, forming a new polytype, 6R-SnNbSe2. This compound crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group R3m and exhibits bulk superconductivity below Tc around 4 K. Structural, electronic, and magnetic measurements confirm the emergence of a superconducting phase derived from Sn intercalation into the non-superconducting 3R-NbSe2. Temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth and superfluid density measurements down to 1.5 K are performed using the tunnel diode oscillator technique. The findings suggest the mixing of nodal and nodeless superconductivity in 6R-SnNbSe2. Given the non-centrosymmetric nature of the crystal structure and the theoretical prediction of topological nodal-line features in SnNbSe2, it is an interesting candidate to investigate unconventional pairing mechanisms. Our findings highlight the potential of this material to host nontrivial superconducting states among the transition-metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p>Pauli crystals are unique geometric structures of non-interacting fermions, resembling crystals, that emerge solely from Fermi statistics and confinement. Unlike genuine quantum crystals that arise from interparticle interactions, Pauli crystals do not break translation symmetry but nonetheless exhibit nontrivial many-body correlations. In this Letter, we explore Pauli crystal formation in a cavity-fermion setup. We analytically show that when coupled to a cavity, degeneracy in Pauli crystals can trigger zero-threshold transitions to superradiance. This superradiance is accompanied by the emergence of a genuine quantum crystalline state, wherein the atomic density is periodically modulated. We substantiate our findings using state-of-the-art numerical simulations. The combined interplay between statistics, confinement geometry and interactions mediated by light thus facilitates a novel pathway to quantum crystallization.</p>

            <h2>Global Stress Generation and Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator under Dynamic Loading for Two-Phase Random Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tengfei Xing, Xiaodan Ren, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and performance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in materials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in two-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often associated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key locations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering applications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data and its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for deep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress fields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In this study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and spatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress Diffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data. This framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically investigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy. Next, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal super-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning method. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights on model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based constraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during training and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to arbitrary magnifications.</p>

We focus on the efficiency of the heat-to-coherence work conversion and show that the Carnot cycle achieves the classical Carnot efficiency, while the performance of the Otto cycle is upper-bounded by the Carnot efficiency corresponding to the extreme temperatures of the cycle. We identify entropy generation during the isochoric stages as the key source of irreversibility limiting the Otto cycle's efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Calvert, Frank den Hollander, Dana Randall</p>
            <p>The stationary distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain is generally a complicated function of its transition rates. However, we show that if the transition rates are i.i.d. random variables with a common distribution satisfying certain tail conditions, then the resulting stationary distribution is close in total variation distance to the distribution that is proportional to the inverse of the exit rates of the states. This result, which generalizes and makes a precise prediction of Chvykov et al. (2021), constitutes the first rigorous validation of an emerging physical theory of order in non-equilibrium systems. The proof entails showing that the stationary distribution of the corresponding "jump chain," i.e., the discrete-time Markov chain with transition probabilities given by the normalized transition rates, is asymptotically uniform as the number of states grows, which settles a question raised by Bordenave, Caputo, and Chafaï (2012) under certain assumptions.</p>

Although the discovery of novel molecules that extend the boundaries of known chemistry requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, ML models often struggle to generalize OOD. Furthermore, there are currently no systematic benchmarks for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present BOOM, $\boldsymbol{b}$enchmarks for $\boldsymbol{o}$ut-$\boldsymbol{o}$f-distribution $\boldsymbol{m}$olecular property predictions -- a benchmark study of property-based out-of-distribution models for common molecular property prediction models. We evaluate more than 140 combinations of models and property prediction tasks to benchmark deep learning models on their OOD performance. Overall, we do not find any existing models that achieve strong OOD generalization across all tasks: even the top performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x larger than in-distribution. We find that deep learning models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. Although chemical foundation models with transfer and in-context learning offer a promising solution for limited training data scenarios, we find that current foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation capabilities. We perform extensive ablation experiments to highlight how OOD performance is impacted by data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation. We propose that developing ML models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML model development. This open-source benchmark will be made available on Github.</p>

            <p>Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, because these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks, with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned scientific applications.</p>

            <p>Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, it is commonly held that deterministic preparation of mechanical Wigner negativity in the unresolved-sideband regime is not possible, as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this, by accounting for the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.</p>

In this study, we investigate some non-trivial mixed states and phase transitions between them by using the second Rényi conditional mutual information (CMI). The CMI can measure mixed state ``gap'', estimated by the exponential decay rate of the second Rényi CMI under a tripartition of system, which provides the second Rényi version of the Markov length. We introduce an efficient numerical scheme for the calculation of the second Rényi CMI based on the doubled Hilbert space formalism, and study the classification of non-trivial mixed states and the emergence of mixed state phase transitions for (i) the cluster model under odd-site local $Z$ decoherence and (ii) transverse field Ising model under both $ZZ$ and $X$ decoherence. The second Rényi CMI is a powerful measure to study non-trivial mixed ``gapped" quantum matters and mixed phase transitions. In addition to this, the present study shows that the second Rényi CMI exhibits specific behavior for the transition to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking mixed phase.</p>

            <h2>Emergent scattering regimes in disordered metasurfaces near critical packing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Chen, Adrian Agreda, Tong Wu, Franck Carcenac, Kevin Vynck, Philippe Lalanne</p>
            <p>Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include color shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies -- for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.</p>

            <h2>Heterosynaptic Circuits Are Universal Gradient Machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liu Ziyin, Isaac Chuang, Tomaso Poggio</p>
            <p>We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics, thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in nature.</p>

            <h2>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Thakur, Prabhat Prakash, Raghavan Ranganathan</p>
            <p>Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex decreases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Random Energy Model is the Limit of Quantum $ p $-Spin Glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anouar Kouraich, Chokri Manai, Simone Warzel</p>
            <p>We consider the free energy of a class of spin glass models with $ p$-spin interactions in a transverse magnetic field. As $ p \to \infty $, the infinite system-size free energy is proven to converge to that of the quantum random energy model. This is accomplished by combining existing analytical techniques addressing the non-commutative properties of such quantum glasses, with the description of the typical geometry of extreme negative deviations of the classical $ p $-spin glass. We also review properties of the corresponding classical free energy and conjectures addressing $ 1/p $-corrections in the quantum case.</p>
