            <h2>Proper Theory of Magnon Orbital Angular Momentum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyu Tang, Ran Cheng</p>
            <p>The orbital motion of chargeless bosons, unlike that of electrons, does not generate a magnetic moment and thus cannot directly interact with magnetic fields. Utilizing the Aharonov-Casher effect and perturbation theory, we formulate a proper theory for the magnon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at finite temperatures, explicitly identifying both self-rotation and topological contributions, analogous to the electronic counterpart but with correct bosonic statistics. Comparing with previous studies on magnon OAM, the magnon spin Nernst effect can only be correctly reproduced using the proper theory for magnon OAM. In a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, we show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces a large magnon OAM in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states. Our formulation provides a foundation for studying orbital dynamics of chargeless bosons with intrinsic spin.</p>

            <h2>Coherent matter wave emission from an atomtronic transistor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sasanka Dowarah, Mengxin Du, Alan Zanders, Shengwang Du, Michael Kolodrubetz, Chuanwei Zhang</p>
            <p>The atomtronic matter-wave triple-well transistor is theoretically predicted to exhibit current gain and act as a coherent matter-wave emitter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of an atomtronic transistor composed of a triple-well potential -- source, gate, and drain -- modeled by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We systematically explore the dependence of the drain population and the current on the source bias potential and the strength of the interatomic interaction. Our simulations reveal signatures of resonant tunneling when the source chemical potential aligns with discrete energy levels in the gate well, leading to coherent matter-wave emission in the drain. Contrary to previous many-body studies that predicted interaction-induced current gain via coupling to gate well modes, our results suggest that coherence in the drain is primarily governed by single-particle resonances, with no evident broadening from nonlinear coupling.</p>

            <h2>Pure many-body interactions in colloidal systems by artificial random light fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Augustin Muster, Luis S. Froufe-PÃ©rez</p>
            <p>We propose a method to generate pure many-body interactions in colloidal systems by using optical forces induced by random optical fields with an optimized spectral energy density. To assess the feasibility in general settings, we develop a simple model for Lorentzian electric and magnetic dipole response. An optimization procedure is then introduced to design the spectral energy density of the random field that minimizes pair interactions at constant electromagnetic energy density. We conclude that, under rather general circumstances, it is possible to effectively cancel pair interactions within a range of distance. Hence a colloid can be driven to interact exclusively through many-body interactions</p>

            <h2>Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Transitions in Flat-Band Lattices with Quadratic and Linear Band Touchings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenhaoyue Wang, Carlos J. Garcia-Cervera, Amartya S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>Bloch oscillations (BOs) describe the coherent oscillatory motion of electrons in a periodic lattice under a constant external electric field. Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling.</p>

            <h2>High-spin magnetic ground states of neutral dopant clusters in semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rhine Samajdar, Haonan Zhou, R. N. Bhatt</p>
            <p>High-spin states hold significant promise for classical and quantum information storage and emerging magnetic memory technologies. Here, we present a systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant clusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In single-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are hydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations, except in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit oscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled suppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum arsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin that scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the tight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging from finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two dimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net spin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic limit, including one which achieves over $70\%$ polarization. Our results provide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in semiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for their experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Fraunhofer patterns in Cd$_3$As$_2$ Josephson Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rak-Hee Kim, Yeongmin Jang, Bob M. Wang, Dong Yu, Yong-Joo Doh</p>
            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors are promising for quantum computing, yet their unambiguous detection remains challenging. We fabricated Josephson junctions (JJs) using Cd$_3$As$_2$ Dirac semimetal nanoribbons with NbTi superconducting electrodes to investigate topological supercurrents through Fraunhofer pattern analysis. The JJs exhibited excellent quality with high transparency ($\tau$ = 0.77) and large induced superconducting gap ($\Delta$ = 1.10 meV), confirmed by multiple Andreev reflection features. While node lifting at the third minimum of the Fraunhofer pattern was observed as a predicted signature of 4{$\pi$}-periodic topological supercurrents, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that asymmetric supercurrent distributions can reproduce this behavior without invoking MZMs. These findings reveal that anomalous Fraunhofer patterns alone cannot reliably confirm topological superconductivity, necessitating complementary experimental approaches for conclusive Majorana detection</p>

            <h2>Electro-optic effects in some sliding ferroelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xueqing Wan, Zhenlong Zhang, Charles Paillard, Jinyang Ni, Lei Zhang, Zhijun Jiang, Laurent Bellaiche</p>
            <p>Sliding ferroelectrics, which exhibit out-of-plane polarization arising from specific stacking rather than conventional ionic displacements, are new types of ferroelectrics whose underdeveloped physics needs to be explored. Here, we investigate for the first time the electro-optic (EO) response of these materials using first-principles calculations, focusing on ZrI$_{2}$ as a prototype. We reveal that, contrary to conventional ferroelectrics, the EO effect in ZrI$_{2}$ is dominated by its electronic contribution rather than the ionic one, which promises faster EO responses. Furthermore, both biaxial and uniaxial strains significantly enhance this response, and a novel, universal-like linear relationship between the band gap and such response is discovered. We also report a large elasto-optic coefficient that is independent of biaxial strain. Similar large linear EO coefficients and properties are found in other sliding ferroelectrics, including different zirconium dihalides, as well as BN and BP bilayers. These findings highlight sliding ferroelectrics as highly promising candidates for ultrafast nonlinear optical devices and reveal novel EO mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Quantized Piezospintronic Effect in MoirÃ© Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mario Castro, BenjamÃ­n Mancilla, Fabian Wolff, Alvaro S. Nunez</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel approach for generating and controlling spin currents in an antiferromagnetic twisted honeycomb bilayer in response to an elastic deformation. Utilizing a continuum model, closely based upon the seminal Bistritzer-MacDonald model, that captures the essential physics of low-energy moirÃ© bands, we calculate the spin current response to the deformation in terms of the familiar Berry phase formalism. The resulting moirÃ© superlattice potential modulates the electronic band structure, leading to emergent topological phases and novel transport properties such as quantized piezo responses both for spin and charge transport. This approach allows us to tune the system across different topological regimes and to explore the piezo-spintronic responses as a function of the band topology. When inversion symmetry is broken either by a sublattice potential $V$, alignment with an hBN substrate, uniaxial strain, or structural asymmetry present in the moirÃ© superlattice, the system acquires a finite Berry curvature that is opposite in the $K$ and $K'$ valleys (protected by valley time reversal symmetry). In contrast, for strain, the valley-contrasting nature of the pseudo-gauge field ensures that the quantized response is robust and proportional to the sum of the valley Chern numbers. These notable physical properties make these systems promising candidates for groundbreaking spintronic and valleytronic devices.</p>

            <h2>A van der Waals material exhibiting room temperature broken inversion symmetry with ferroelectricity</h2>

            <p>Since the initial synthesis of van der Waals two-dimensional indium selenide was first documented in 1957, five distinct polymorphs and their corresponding polytypes have been identified. In this study, we report a unique phase of indium selenide via Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis in the synthesized large-area films -- which we have named the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase. The quintuple layers of the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase, characterized by a unique zigzag atomic configuration with unequal indium-selenium bond lengths from the middle selenium atom, are distinct from any other previously reported phase of indium selenide. Cross-sectional STEM analysis has revealed that the $\beta^\text{p}$ layers exhibit intralayer shifting. We found that indium selenide films with $\beta^\text{p}$ layers display electric-field-induced switchable polarization characteristic of ferroelectric materials, suggesting the breaking of the inversion symmetry. Experimental observations of nonlinear optical phenomena -- Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) responses further support this conclusion. This study reports a $\beta^\text{p}$ phase of indium selenide showing ferroelectricity over large areas at room temperature in a low-dimensional limit.</p>

            <h2>Fractional quantum Hall state at $Î½= 1/2$ with energy gap up to 6 K, and possible transition from one- to two-component state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddharth Kumar Singh, Chengyu Wang, Adbhut Gupta, Kirk W. Baldwin, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Mansour Shayegan</p>
            <p>The fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS) observed in the lowest Landau level at filling factor $\nu=1/2$ in wide quantum wells has been enigmatic for decades because the two-dimensional electron system (2DES) has a bilayer charge distribution but with significant interlayer tunneling. Of particular interest is whether the 1/2 FQHS in this system has a one-component (1C) or two-component (2C) origin; these are typically identified as the Pfaffian (non-Abelian) or the $\Psi_{331}$ (Abelian) FQHSs, respectively. We report here our experimental study of the evolution of the correlated states of an ultrahigh-quality 2DES confined to a 72.5-nm-wide GaAs quantum well. At the lowest densities, the 2DES displays only odd-denominator FQHSs, and the ground state at $\nu = 1/2$ is a composite fermion Fermi sea. As the density is increased, a FQHS emerges at $\nu = 1/2$, and becomes very strong. In a finite density range where the 1/2 FQHS is strongest, we also observe its daughter FQHSs at $\nu = 8/17$ and 7/13, consistent with the theoretically expected daughter states of a Pfaffian 1/2 FQHS. At the highest densities, the 2DES becomes 2C, signaled by the emergence of a bilayer Wigner crystal state and the transitions of FQHSs flanking $\nu=1/2$. The 1/2 FQHS remains robust near this transition and, notably, its charge transport energy gap exhibits an \textit{upward} cusp with a maximum value of about 6 K on the 1C side of the transition; this is the largest gap reported for any even-denominator FQHS. Our observation of the transition of the 2DES ground states near $\nu=1/2$ to 2C states at high densities, and our measurements of the robustness of the 1/2 FQHS against charge distribution asymmetry, suggest that the 1/2 FQHS also makes a transition from 1C to 2C. Such a transition from a non-Abelian to Abelian state can open avenues for topological quantum information and quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>Magnetoresistance is a powerful probe for characterizing the intrinsic physics embedded in materials. Among its various manifestations, linear magnetoresistance has a long history and continues attracting research interest. In contemporary studies, a clear understanding of the magnetoresistance character of quantum origin is more crucial than ever for the study of emerging materials. In this perspective, we examine the linear magnetoresistance of quantum mechanism, from its theoretical basis to experimental studies, and discuss open questions and promising future research directions in this field.</p>

            <h2>Variation Monte Carlo Study on the bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Chen, Yu-Bo Liu, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has aroused significant interest in exploring the pairing mechanism. Previous studies have proposed an effective d$_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model, in which the electrons of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are charge carriers, which are subject to the intralayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange $J_{\parallel}$ and the large interlayer AFM superexchange $J_{\perp}\approx 2J_{\parallel}$, with the latter transferred from the nearly half-filled and hence localized $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the strong Hund's rule coupling. Here we study this model by the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulation and find a dominant interlayer s-wave pairing, in which the SC order parameters have a drastic improvement compared with those of the mean field (MF) type of theories. In real materials, the Hund's coupling is finite, leading to reduced $J_{\perp}$, dictating that the MF-type theories have difficulty explaining the HTSC. However, our VMC calculations find that even for effective $J_{\perp}$ as weak as $J_{\perp}=J_{\parallel}$, the interlayer pairing is still considerably large and can be compared with the $T_c$ observed in experiments, which is very weak in MF-type theories. This result indicates the important role of the Gutzwiller projection in improving the $T_c$, which is ignored in the MF-type theories. In addition, our results show that suppressed interlayer hopping can promote interlayer pairing, which is consistent with the fact that the interlayer hopping of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is very weak. Our research offers a new perspective for understanding the pairing mechanism of bilayer nickelates and provides a reference for recent ultra-cold atom experiments in mixed-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>Novel family of near-room-temperature compensated itinerant pyrochlore ferrimagnets, $R{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{Co}}_{4}$ ($R=$ Dy-Tm)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Shiotani, T. Waki, Y. Tabata, I. KÃ©zsmÃ¡rki, H. Nakamura</p>
            <p>We successfully synthesized single crystals of a series of C15b Laves phase compounds, $R{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{Co}}_{4}$ ($R=$ Dy-Tm), with Co-pyrochlore and $R$-fcc sublattices, and systematically studied their magnetic properties via magnetometry measurements. These itinerant cubic compounds, with Curie temperatures above room temperature, show compensated ferrimagnetism featuring an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two sublattices. From this series, ${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$ exhibits the highest $T_{\rm C}$ (= 368 K) and a near-room-temperature compensation point $T_{\rm cp}$ (= 295 K). $T_{\rm C}$ does not change drastically with the $R$ atom, whereas $T_{\rm cp}$ depends on the de Gennes factor of $R^{3+}$. Another magnetization anomaly is observed in all the compounds at low temperatures, which may be indicative of changes in the lattice or magnetic structure. The easy axis the ferrimagnetic moment of ${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$, ${\mathrm{ErInCo}}_{4}$, and ${\mathrm{TmInCo}}_{4}$ is found at $T =$ 5 K to be along the [001], [111] and [110] directions, respectively. However, the simple easy-axis or easy-plane ferrimagnetic picture cannot be applied to ${\mathrm{HoInCo}}_{4}$. These observations suggest that the $R$ sublattice determines magnetic anisotropy and compensation, while the Co sublattice plays a role in strong magnetic ordering. The high Curie temperature, together with the magnetization compensation point near room temperature, renders these itinerant pyrochlore magnets interesting for spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Mixing of a binary passive particle system using smart active particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Jacob, Siddhant Mohapatra, Rajalingam A, Sam Mathew, Pallab Sinha Mahapatra</p>
            <p>Controlled activity of active entities interacting with a passive environment can generate emergent system-level phenomena, positioning such systems as promising platforms for potential downstream applications in targeted drug delivery, adaptive and reconfigurable materials, microfluidic transport and related fields. The present work aims to realise an optimal mixing of two segregated species of passive particles by introducing a small fraction of active particles (2% by composition) with adaptive and intelligent behaviour, directed by a trained Artificial Neural Network-based agent. While conventional run-and-tumble particles can induce mixing in the system, the smart active particles demonstrate superior performance, achieving faster and more efficient mixing. Interestingly, an optimal mixing strategy doesn't involve a uniform dispersion of active particles in the domain, but rather limiting their motion to an eccentrically placed zone of activity, inducing a global rotational motion of the passive particles about the system centre. A transition in the directionality of the passive particles' motion is observed along the radius towards the centre, likening the active particles' motion to an ellipse-shaped void with a defined surface speed. Situated at the intersection of active matter and machine learning, this work highlights the potential of integrating adaptive learning frameworks into traditional active matter models.</p>

            <h2>Braids and Beams: Exploring Fractional Statistics with Mesoscopic Anyon Colliders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernd Rosenow, Bertrand I. Halperin</p>
            <p>Anyon colliders -- quantum Hall devices where dilute quasiparticle beams collide at a quantum point contact -- provide an interferometer-free probe of anyonic exchange phases through current cross correlations. Within a non-equilibrium bosonization framework, the normalized cross-correlations take a universal form depending only on the exchange phase and the dynamical exponent, enabling experimental demonstration of anyonic statistics. This result can be interpreted as time-domain interference -- braiding in time rather than spatial exclusion or real-space interferometry. Extension to hierarchical states shows that the semiclassical step-function description of quasiparticles fails at large statistical angles. Introducing a finite soliton width resolves this issue and enables quantitative modeling of charge-$e/5$ quasiparticle collisions.</p>

            <h2>Integrable Floquet Time Crystals in One Dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Chandra, Mahbub Rahaman, Soumyabroto Majumder, Analabha Roy, Sujit Sarkar</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics. We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them. Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal fragility of disordered realizations.</p>

            <h2>Spin-wave propagation at low temperatures in YIG thin films on YSGG substrates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> JosÃ© Elias AbrÃ£o, Daan Weltens, Rhodri Mansell, Sebastiaan van Dijken, LukÃ¡Å¡ FlajÅ¡man</p>
            <p>The use of spin waves in magnetic thin films at cryogenic temperatures has long been hindered by the lack of a suitable material platform. Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is the leading candidate, yet it is typically grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates, which develop a large paramagnetic moment at low temperatures. This substrate effect limits spin-wave propagation. In this work, we demonstrate that thin YIG films grown on yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG) substrates support robust spin-wave propagation in the Damon-Eshbach geometry, measurable down to 2 K under applied magnetic fields up to 150 mT. Compared with YIG/GGG, YIG/YSGG films exhibit narrower ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidths at low temperatures and are free from the atomic interdiffusion effects that degrade the performance of YIG/GGG systems. These results establish YIG/YSGG thin films as a promising low-temperature platform, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of YIG/GGG and opening new opportunities for scalable magnonic and hybrid quantum devices operating under cryogenic conditions.</p>

Until recently, a handful of defects in a small selection of host materials have been possible candidates. Recent developments have revealed that hexagonal boron nitride, a wide-bandgap two-dimensional material, hosts single-photon-emitting atomic defects with access to optically addressable electronic and nuclear spins at room temperature. Now, atomically thin quantum devices that operate at ambient conditions are a possibility. In this perspective, we discuss the recent progress, and challenges, in understanding the fundamental photophysics of defects in hBN, as well as specific opportunities they present for the development of quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Magnetic hyperthermia with metallic nanoparticles is a therapeutic strategy that relies on heating cancer cells to levels sufficient to damage or destroy them. After injection, the nanoparticles accumulate in tumor tissues, where they transfer energy from the applied time-dependent magnetic field to the surrounding medium, thereby increasing the local temperature. This heating effect can be spatially focused (superlocalized) by combining AC and DC magnetic fields. Heat generation arises either from the rotation of the particle or from the rotation of its magnetic moment. The theoretical framework is provided by the Martsenyuk-Raikher-Shliomis (MRSh) equation for the former and the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (sLLG) equation for the latter. However, by using the concept of magnetic and ordinary viscosity, the results of these approaches can be directly compared, which is our goal in this work, with special emphasis on their ability to achieve spatial localization. On the basis of this comparison, we propose the use of perpendicular AC and DC magnetic fields for image-guided thermal therapy with magnetic particle imaging.</p>

Temperature-dependent Hall measurements, in conjunction with a charge balance model, revealed that the carrier loss was due to a drastic reduction in acceptor concentration ($N_A$), suggesting that a significant fraction of Mg atoms incorporated in an electrically neutral configuration. A quantitative semi-empirical model based on the grand canonical formalism pointed to the formation of $(V_N-3Mg_{Ga})^0$ complexes as the primary cause for the observed carrier loss.</p>

A further power-less augmentation to the angular momentum of the theory with classical kinetic energy density is also considered, which allows for plausible approaches to model the Einstein-de Haas and Barnett effects within continuum mechanics, as well as hard magnetic soft materials treated as constrained polar materials within the overall framework.</p>

            <h2>Twist dominates bending in the liquid crystal organization of bacteriophage DNA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei Liu, Tamara Christiani, Zhijie Wang, Fei Guo, Mariel Vazquez, M. Carme Calderer, Javier Arsuaga</p>
            <p>DNA frequently adopts liquid-crystalline conformations in both cells and viruses. The Oseen--Frank framework provides a powerful continuum description of these phases through three elastic moduli: splay ($K_1$), twist or cholesteric ($K_2$), and bending ($K_3$). While $K_1$ is typically assumed to dominate, the relative magnitude of $K_2$ and $K_3$ in confined DNA remains poorly understood. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy, liquid-crystal modeling, and knot theory to quantify this relationship in bacteriophage P4, whose genome is partially organized in a spool-like liquid-crystalline phase. We first show experimentally that the ordered DNA occupies three concentric layers within the capsid. We then formulate an Oseen--Frank model for this geometry and use it, together with the measured layer radii, to estimate the elastic ratio $\alpha = K_3/K_2$. We find $\alpha \approx 0.0064$, indicating that twist elasticity overwhelmingly dominates bending. To validate this result, we perform Langevin dynamics simulations of DNA trajectories and classify the resulting knots. The predicted knot distribution agrees with experimental data from P4, demonstrating consistency between elasticity, topology, and observed genome organization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomas Basile, Natascha Leijnse, Malte Slot Lauridsen, Younes Farhangi Barooji, Amin Doostmohammadi, Karel Proesmans</p>
            <p>Distinguishing active from passive dynamics is a fundamental challenge in understanding the motion of living cells and other active matter systems. Here, we introduce a framework that combines physical modeling, analytical theory, and machine learning to identify and characterize active fluctuations from trajectory data. We train a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network on synthetic trajectories generated from well-defined stochastic models of active particles, enabling it to classify motion as passive or active and to infer the underlying active process. Applied to experimental trajectories of a tracer in the cytoplasm of a living cell, the method robustly identifies actively driven motion and selects an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck active noise model as the best description. Crucially, the classifier's performance on simulated data approaches the theoretical optimum that we derive, and it also yields accurate estimates of the active diffusion coefficient. This integrated approach opens a powerful route to quantify non-equilibrium fluctuations in complex biological systems from limited data.</p>

            <h2>Equilibrium properties of strongly confined fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ana M. Montero</p>
            <p>The statistical-mechanical study of the equilibrium properties of fluids, starting from the knowledge of the interparticle interaction potential, is essential to understand the role that microscopic interaction between individual particles play in the properties of the fluid. The study of these properties from a fundamental point of view is therefore a central goal in condensed matter physics. These properties, however, might vary greatly when a fluid is confined to extremely narrow channels and, therefore, must be examined separately. This thesis investigates fluids in narrow pores, where particles are forced to stay in single-file formation and cannot pass one another. The resulting systems are highly anisotropic: motion is free along the channel axis but strongly restricted transversely. To quantify these effects, equilibrium properties of the confined fluids are compared with their bulk counterparts, exposing the role of dimensionality. We also develop a novel theoretical framework based on a mapping approach that converts single-file fluids with nearest-neighbor interactions into an equivalent one-dimensional mixture. This exact isomorphism delivers closed expressions for thermodynamic and structural quantities. It allows us to compute the anisotropic pressure tensor and revises definitions of spatial correlations to take into account spatial anisotropy. The theory is applied to hard-core, square-well, square-shoulder, and anisotropic hard-body models, revealing phenomena such as zigzag ordering and structural crossovers of spatial correlations. Analytical predictions are extensively validated against Monte Carlo and molecular dynamic simulations (both original and from the literature), showing excellent agreement across the studied parameter ranges.</p>

            <h2>Learning Linear Regression with Low-Rank Tasks in-Context</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Takanami, Takashi Takahashi, Yoshiyuki Kabashima</p>
            <p>In-context learning (ICL) is a key building block of modern large language models, yet its theoretical mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is particularly mysterious how ICL operates in real-world applications where tasks have a common structure. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing a linear attention model trained on low-rank regression tasks. Within this setting, we precisely characterize the distribution of predictions and the generalization error in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we find that statistical fluctuations in finite pre-training data induce an implicit regularization. Finally, we identify a sharp phase transition of the generalization error governed by task structure. These results provide a framework for understanding how transformers learn to learn the task structure.</p>

            <p>The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated predictions of critical currents and switching times.</p>

            <p>We numerically study the collective dynamics of dense particle assemblies driven by non-reciprocal pairwise forces of amplitude $\kappa$. At a critical value $\kappa_{\rm c}$, the system undergoes a dynamical phase transition from an absorbing state ($\kappa < \kappa_{\rm c}$) to a chaotic steady state ($\kappa > \kappa_{\rm c}$). The chaotic phase is marked by nontrivial spatiotemporal velocity correlations and mixing, reminiscent of active turbulence in self-propelled systems. The sharp onset of chaos shows critical scaling consistent with the universality class of directed percolation. We argue that this transition is generic to a broad class of locally-driven, dense disordered materials.</p>

            <h2>Investigating into mechanisms of high temperature strength of refractory high-entropy alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sai Anandhi Seetharaman, Soumyadipta Maiti, Ambesh Gupta, Beena Rai</p>
            <p>The yield strength plateau of two BCC refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) - MoNbTaVW and MoNbTaW was examined through hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations. By analyzing atomic diffusivities derived from vacancy formation and migration energies around the edge dislocation cores, the number of critical atomic swaps were calculated at different temperatures. Using hybrid MC/MD simulations of these critical swaps, we demonstrate that above 1400K, the stress required to move the dislocations gets saturated, indicating the effect of Dynamic Strain Ageing (DSA) via cross core motion. Further simulations on random solid solutions (0 MC swaps) revealed a similar plateau effect at the intermediate temperatures. This was attributed to the additional athermal stress arising from lattice distortions due to solid solution strengthening. Our findings suggest that the yield strength plateau results from an interplay between the DSA-driven diffusion process and athermal stress. Specifically, the plateau emerges from DSA mechanisms in the presence of atomic diffusion, whereas in the absence of diffusion, it is governed by athermal statistical lattice distortions. This dual mechanism framework provides a comprehensive explanation for the experimentally observed Yield strength behavior in RHEAs at intermediate temperatures.</p>

We identify a set of symmetries of the interaction potential, which generate degeneracies among the interaction parameters, and use these to classify the resulting spatial symmetries and equilibrium shapes of the gases. Exploiting these symmetries we analyze solutions including beyond-meanfield quantum fluctuations, and develop complementary variational results.

            <h2>Robust Kirkwood-Buff inversion in complex mixtures via reciprocal-space methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> RÃ©mi Busselez</p>
            <p>Understanding the relationship between microscopic structure and macroscopic thermodynamic properties is a central challenge in the study of complex fluids. The Kirkwood-Buff (KB) theory offers an elegant and powerful framework for bridging this gap by relating integrals over pair correlation functions to measurable thermodynamic quantities. In multicomponent systems, KB integrals connect directly to derivatives of thermodynamic potentials, including chemical potentials derivatives, partial molar volumes, and isothermal compressibility. While several computational methods exist to estimate KB integrals from molecular simulations, their application often demands careful treatment of finite-size effects and explicit extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Recently, alternative strategies based on the analysis of partial structure factors in reciprocal space have been proposed. Unlike real-space approaches, reciprocal-space methods avoid the additional truncation artifacts associated with direct integration or fluctuations in subensemble. They evaluate density fluctuations across the entire simulation box, fully accounting for periodic boundary conditions rather than relying on subdomains. As a result, these methods offer a compelling alternative, providing enhanced numerical stability for estimating KB integrals in complex mixtures. In this work, we extend, compare and validate these methods using binary and quaternary Lennard-Jones mixtures, as well as realistic molecular systems such as hexane-ethanol, water-urea, and aqueous NaCl mixtures. Our results provide practical guidelines for computing KB integrals and associated thermodynamic properties from canonical ensemble simulations, including recommendations on reciprocal-space extrapolation, uncertainty estimation, and linear algebra formulations of thermodynamic derivatives.</p>

            <p>Orbital-selective many-body effects, in which electrons occupying different orbitals experience distinct interaction strengths, play a crucial role in correlated multiorbital materials. However, these effects usually manifest in a complex manner, obscuring their microscopic origins. Here, by combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements with theoretical calculations, we reveal pronounced orbital selectivity in both electron-electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling in the van der Waals material V2Se2O. Electron correlation induces distinct bandwidth renormalization exclusively in the V d_xy-derived band, while the bands mainly composed of the other d orbitals remain essentially unrenormalized. Orbital-resolved analyses identify that the filling number and the bandwidth are decisive factors governing orbital-dependent correlation. Simultaneously, the d_(xz/yz)-derived band exhibits a sharp kink anomaly, arising from enhanced coupling to high-energy phonon modes dominated by oxygen vibrations. Such pronounced orbital selectivity positions V2Se2O as a rare and prototypical platform for unravelling the microscopic mechanisms of orbital-selective electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and offers guiding principles for the design of correlated multiorbital materials.</p>

In this work, we realize a monolithic Tamm-plasmon microcavity embedding a thin film of two-dimensional halide perovskites with a tunable polymer spacer that controls the exciton-photon detuning. Angle-resolved optical spectroscopy at room temperature reveals the lower polariton branch dispersions in the linear regime for several detunings. Under circularly polarized, non-resonant laser excitation, the spin injection of high-energy excitons and their relaxation towards the lower polariton branch demonstrates its preservation, in contrast to the bare exciton case. The spin-polarized emission survives due to the fast decay of polaritons. Our results provide promising insights into the non-resonant spin control of polaritonic devices, including chiral lasers and switches.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the high stability of simulated graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under large externally imposed deformations and high temperature annealing. Hyperbolic pseudospheres are produced in a two-step Molecular Dynamics simulation process. First, carbon atoms are forced down a thin three-dimensional volume of a chosen shape. During this extrusion process the carbon atoms form a precursor to graphene that is unrealistically less stable than graphite or diamond. Then the unstable carbon structure is annealed inside the thin volume at high temperature, turning the carbon into realistic polycrystalline, curved graphene. Point defects naturally appear in numbers and places that stabilize the graphene in the desired shape, without high residual stresses. We applied this new methodology to the creation of graphene hyperbolic pseudosphere surfaces, which reproduce analogs to some aspects of classical or quantum gravity. The free edges of the pseudosphere cause bending of the graphene. When these free edges are removed from the simulations by attaching periodic flat graphene sheets to the pseudosphere edges, the carbon atoms assume positions just some tenths of Ã from the mathematical hyperbolic pseudosphere surface. In demanding tests of their stability, the hyperbolic pseudospheres proved stable against $20^\circ$ shearing or $20\%$ elongation and then being released, which eventually raised their temperatures by $\sim 300 \ \text{K}$. Our methodology is relatively easy to use and offers a practical way to create simulated curved graphene surfaces of almost any shape. It allows for thorough testing in advance of the stability of graphene shapes that are to be produced experimentally.</p>

            <p>A two-dimensional topologically nontrivial state of noninteracting electrons, such as the surface state of a three-dimensional topological insulator, is predicted to realize a topological superconductor when proximity-coupled to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor. In contrast, noninteracting electrons partially occupying a Landau level, with Rashba spin-orbit coupling that lifts the spin degeneracy, fail to develop topological superconductivity under similar proximity coupling in the presence of the conventional Abrikosov vortex lattice. We demonstrate through exact diagonalization that, at half-filled Landau level, introducing a repulsive interaction between electrons induces topological superconductivity for a range of parameters. This appears rather surprising because a repulsive interaction is expected to inhibit, not promote, pairing, but suggests an appealing principle for realizing topological superconductivity: proximity-coupling a composite Fermi liquid to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</p>

            <p>Biotite crystals are phyllosilicate trioctahedral micas with the general chemical formula K(Mg,Fe)3AlSi3O10(OH)2 that form a solid-solution series with iron-poor phlogopite and iron-rich annite endmembers. With a wide band gap energy and a layered structure with free surface charges, biotite nanosheets can be readily obtained by cleavage methods and used as dielectrics in nanodevice fabrication for the next generation of electronics and energy harvesting. Here, a comprehensive study of biotite samples with different iron concentrations and oxidation states is presented. Structural, optical, magneto-optical, and magnetic characterizations were performed using several experimental techniques, including state-of-the-art synchrotron-based techniques, to correlate the iron chemistry (content and oxidation state) with the macroscopic properties of both minerals. The study reveals a nanoscale-homogeneous Fe distribution via synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping, defect-mediated optical transitions modulated by Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios, and temperature-dependent magnetic transitions from paramagnetism to competing ferro-/antiferromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, the use of these biotite crystals as substrates for ultrathin heterostructures incorporating monolayer (ML) MoSe2 is explored by magneto photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures. The results show that the presence of iron impurities in different oxidation states significantly impacts the valley properties for ML-MoSe2. Overall, these findings offer a comprehensive interpretation of the physical properties of bulk biotites in a correlative approach, serving as a robust reference for future studies aiming to explore biotites in their ultrathin form.</p>

            <p>Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p>

The conduction tail states exhibit larger phonon-induced fluctuations than the valence tail states.

            <p>The frustrated magnet Bi2Fe4O9 has been reported to exhibit complex spin dynamics coexisting with conventional spin wave excitations. The magnetic Fe3+ (S = 5/2) ions are arranged into a distorted two-dimensional Cairo pentagonal lattice with weak couplings between the layers, developing long-ranged non-collinear antiferromagnetic order below 245 K. In order to enable studies and modelling of the complex dynamics close to TN, we have reexamined the magnetic excitations across the complete energy scale (0 < E < 90 meV) at 10 K. We discover two distinct gaps, which can be explained by introducing, respectively, easy axis and easy plane anisotropy on the two unequivalent Fe-sites. We develop a refined spin Hamiltonian that accurately accounts for the dispersion of essentially all spin-wave branches across the full spectral range, except around 40 meV, where a splitting and dispersion are observed. We propose that this mode is derived from phonon hybridization. Polarisation analysis shows that the system has magnetic anisotropic fluctuations, consistent with our model. A continuum of scattering is observed above the spin wave branches and is found to principally be explained by an instrumental resolution effect. The full experimental mapping of the excitation spectrum and the refined spin Hamiltonian provides a foundation for future quantitative studies of spin waves coexisting with unconventional magnetic fluctuations in this frustrated magnet found at higher temperatures.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interplay between screening, electronic correlations, and collective excitations is essential for the design of two-dimensional quantum materials. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles study of more than 60 MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers, encompassing semiconducting, metallic, cold-metallic, magnetic, and topological phases. Using the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), we compute material-specific effective Coulomb interaction parameters $U$, $U'$, and $J$, including their spatial dependence across distinct correlated subspaces defined by local coordination and crystal symmetry. In semiconducting compounds, long-range nonlocal interactions persist, revealing unconventional screening and suggesting strong excitonic effects beyond simple dielectric models. In cold-metallic systems, sizable long-range Coulomb interactions remain despite the presence of free carriers, highlighting their atypical metallic screening. Among 33-valence-electron compounds, we find $U_{\mathrm{eff}} > W$ in the $\beta_2$ phase, indicating proximity to charge-density-wave or Mott instabilities. Several V- and Nb-based systems exhibit intermediate-to-strong correlation strength, with $U/W > 1 $ in multiple cases. Using cRPA-derived Stoner parameters, we identify magnetic instabilities in various V-, Nb-, Cr-, and Mn-based compounds. Finally, selected cold-metallic systems display plasmon dispersions that deviate from the conventional $\sqrt{q}$ behavior, revealing nearly non-dispersive low-energy modes. These results position MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers as a versatile platform for investigating correlation-driven instabilities and emergent collective behavior in two dimensions.</p>

            <p>Thin surfaces are ubiquitous in nature, from leaves to cell membranes, and in technology, from paper to corrugated containers. Structural thinness imbues them with flexibility, the ability to easily bend under light loads, even as their much higher stretching stiffness can bear substantial stresses. When surfaces have periodic patterns of either smooth hills and valleys or sharp origami-like creases this can substantially modify their mechanical response. We show that for any such surface, there is a duality between the surface rotations of an isometric deformation and the in-plane stresses of a force-balanced configuration. This duality means that of the six possible combinations of global in-plane strain and out-of-plane bending, exactly three must be isometries. We show further that stressed configurations can be expressed in terms of both the applied deformation and the isometric deformation that is dual to the pattern of stress that arises. We identify constraints rooted in symplectic geometry on the three isometries that a single surface can generate. This framework sheds new light on the fundamental limits of the mechanical response of thin periodic surfaces, while also highlighting the role that continuum differential geometry plays in even sharply creased origami surfaces.</p>

            <p>Frustration in Kondo spin lattice systems has led to the emergence of both spin liquids that could be chiral and strange metals that deviate from Fermi liquid behaviour when not in their antiferromagnetic ground state. In two dimensions (2D), where deviations from bulk systems are expected, Kondo spin lattice emergence have recently been observed in van der Waals systems. Metallo-molecular interfaces of supramolecular lattices have also been suggested as an alternative 2D Kondo spin lattice system where a single-ion Kondo effect as well as an inter spin-site Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling has been demonstrated in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) studies. Here, going beyond ultrahigh vacuum STS studies on metallo-molecular interfaces, we report a metastable frustrated antiferromagnetic state, with ultra-high spin freezing temperatures (T_f), ranging from 240 K to 300 K on the interfaces of highly textured Pt(111) and Pt(111)/Co films with organic molecules grown in ultra-high vacuum 10^(-10) mbar. In the vicinity of the spin-freezing transition, we measure a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in the Pt/Co/molecular heterostructure, with a Nernst coefficient of at least 3 microV per K. Our results suggest a 2D metallo-molecular Kondo spin lattice with high temperature quantum correlations where an ANE beyond magnetisation is manifested around room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Anyon interactions in the Chern--Simons--Landau--Ginzburg model of the fractional quantum Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Leask</p>
            <p>The interactions of anyonic quasi-particles (vortices) in the Chern--Simons extension of the Ginzburg--Landau model is investigated and we show that it manifestly realizes a hybridization of type I/II superconductivity. Through Gauss' law, each vortex simultaneously carries a flux quantum and a proportional Noether charge, thereby realizing an anyonic excitation. The Chern--Simons coupling also modifies the screening structure of the gauge fields, producing complex-conjugate masses that yield a common penetration depth with an oscillatory phase. This altered asymptotic behavior breaks the conventional type-I/type-II dichotomy of the Ginzburg--Landau model. As a result, vortex anyons experience short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, enabling the formation of separated multi-vortex bound states with non-monotonic interaction energy.</p>

            <h2>Chasing Anharmonicities in Polarization-Orientation Raman Spectra of Acene Crystals with Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Lazzaroni, Shubham Sharma, Mariana Rossi</p>
            <p>We present a first-principles machine-learning computational framework to investigate anharmonic effects in polarization-orientation (PO) Raman spectra of molecular crystals, focusing on anthracene and naphthalene. By combining machine learning models for interatomic potentials and polarizability tensors, we enable efficient, large-scale simulations that capture temperature-dependent vibrational dynamics beyond the harmonic approximation. Our approach reproduces key qualitative features observed experimentally. We show, systematically, what are the fingerprints of anharmonic lattice dynamics, thermal expansion, and Raman tensor symmetries on PO-Raman intensities. However, we find that the simulated polarization dependence of Raman intensities shows only subtle deviations from quasi-harmonic predictions, failing to capture the pronounced temperature-dependent changes that have been reported experimentally in anthracene. We propose that part of these inconsistencies stem from the impossibility to deconvolute certain vibrational peaks when only experimental data is available. This work therefore provides a foundation to improve the interpretation of PO-Raman experiments in complex molecular crystals with the aid of theoretical simulations.</p>

            <p>We report single crystal neutron spectroscopy and bulk characterization on hydrothermally grown $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$, revealing magnetic moment fragmentation embedded within the all-in-all-out ordered state. The spectra reveal a nearly flat band with pinch-point momentum dependence accompanied by dispersive branches that produce half-moon features across multiple Brillouin zones. These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{\mu SR}$ studies, while the lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario. Our results extend moment fragmentation to $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$ and identify it as a clean, tractable platform for quantitative exploration of emergent gauge field physics in frustrated magnets.</p>

            <h2>A network-based approach to measure granule size distribution for discrete element modeling of granulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubham Jain, Anurag Tripathi, Jayanta Chakraborty, Jitendra Kumar</p>
            <p>Drum granulation is a size enlargement process where granular material is agitated with a liquid binder to form larger size granules. Discrete element modeling is increasingly being used to better understand and investigate the granulation process. However, unlike experiments the measurement of granule size within a DEM framework often necessitates an explicit quantitative definition of a granule and a corresponding granule identification method. In this work, we show that the existing definitions and the associated methods in literature are ineffective at identifying granules for dense flows such as during drum granulation. We propose an improved definition and granule identification method based on community-detection used in network science literature. The proposed method better identifies granules in a drum granulator as benchmarked against liquid-settling. We also vary granulation process parameters like liquid content and fill level and study their effect on the cumulative granule size distribution attained after drum granulation. We find that the existing granule-identification methods fail to reproduce the well-known effects of process parameters on the cumulative granule size distribution. The proposed method, based on community detection, reproduces the effects with better accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Effect of ice nucleating proteins on the structure-property relationships of ice: A molecular dynamics study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. K. Shargh, C. D. Stiles, J. A. El-Awady</p>
            <p>Ice-nucleating proteins (INPs) are a unique class of biological macromolecules that catalyze the freezing of supercooled water far more efficiently than homogeneous nucleation. Their remarkable efficiency has motivated applications across diverse sectors, including agricultural frost protection, food processing and packaging, biomedical cryopreservation, and even strategies for mitigating glacier ice loss. The ice-nucleation performance of INPs and the mechanical behavior of the ice they produce depend strongly on their structural and biochemical characteristics. However, the links between INP properties, the resulting ice microstructure, and their mechanical behavior have yet to be systematically established. In this study, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations using the machine-learned ML-BOP potential are employed to investigate how varying INP densities influence the ice nucleation temperature, the resulting ice microstructure, and the mechanical behavior of the formed ice under creep tensile loading. We find that, depending on their density, INPs can significantly raise the ice nucleation rate while altering the grain structure of ice. Our simulations reveal that INP-assisted nucleation leads to faster stabilization of the resulting polycrystalline ice composed of hexagonal ice (ice Ih) and cubic ice (ice Ic) as compared to nucleation in pure water. Moreover, higher INP densities and smaller ice grain sizes reduce the overall yield stress, while promoting diffusion-accommodated grain boundary sliding creep. These findings provide molecular-level insight into how INPs influence both the nucleation process and the mechanical behavior of ice, highlighting a pathway to engineer ice with tailored stability for real-world settings, including human activities and infrastructure in polar and icy environments.</p>

            <h2>Variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Naumann, Jens Eisert, Philipp Schmoll</p>
            <p>We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies.</p>

            <h2>Atomistic Insights into the Degradation of Metal Phthalocyanine Catalysts during Oxygen Reduction Reaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huanhuan Yang, Guangfu Luo</p>
            <p>Oxygen reduction catalysts frequently suffer from degradation under harsh operating conditions, and the limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms hampers the development of effective mitigation strategies. In this study, we integrate first-principles calculations with a time-dependent microkinetic model to investigate the deactivation pathways of six highly active metal phthalocyanines (MPc, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Rh, and Ir) during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We quantitatively assess the ORR processes, hydrogen peroxide generation, radical generation, and three primary degradation mechanisms, namely carbon oxidation, nitrogen protonation, and demetallation, through a reaction network involving 40 chemical species and 75 elementary reactions. Our findings reveal that the dominant degradation mechanism varies significantly across the MPcs. Under typical alkaline conditions, the primary byproducts arise from carbon oxidation, driven by .OH radical attack and structural reorganization of surface adsorbates, and from protonation at either the metal center or nitrogen sites. In the kinetics-controlled region, the ORR activity follows the order of RhPc > IrPc > FePc > MnPc > RuPc > CrPc. Notably, RhPc and IrPc demonstrate both higher ORR activity and greater stability than the widely studied FePc under elevated potentials.</p>

            <p>We report the electronic structure of monolayer CrSBr exfoliated onto mica template-stripped gold substrates. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals charge transfer from the substrate, populating the conduction band of monolayer CrSBr, accompanied by a pronounced reduction in the quasiparticle band gap. Furthermore, we observe two separate conduction bands that exhibit a splitting at the X point. This indicates a breaking of glide-mirror symmetry, which in the bulk or in a free-standing monolayer protects the band degeneracies at the Brillouin zone boundary. Our results demonstrate that ultraflat gold substrates do more than modify carrier densities and screening: they can lift symmetry-protected degeneracies and thus fundamentally reshape the band topology of 2D materials.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the study of Majorana signatures in quantum transport has become a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a rigorous and systematic derivation of the fermionic superoperator describing the open quantum dynamics of electron transport through Majorana zero modes, building on the techniques introduced in Phys. Rev. B 105, 035121 (2022). The numerical implementation of this superoperator is to construct its differential equivalence, the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The HEOM approach describes the system-bath correlated dynamics. Furthermore, we also develop a functional derivative scheme that provides exact expressions for the transport observables in terms of the auxiliary density operators introduced in the HEOM formulation. The superoperator formalism establishes a solid theoretical foundation for analyzing key transport signatures that may uncover the unique characteristics of Majorana physics in mesoscopic systems.</p>

            <p>The interplay of charge and spin orders lies at the heart of correlated electron physics and plays a critical role in the emergence of unconventional quantum phases. Kagome magnets provide a particularly promising platform to investigate these phenomena, owing to their geometrically frustrated lattice structure. However, resolving spin and charge orders microscopically and establishing ways to control them remain fundamental challenges. Here, we demonstrate magnetic field control of an altermagnetic spin density wave order intertwined with charge density wave order in kagome magnet CsCr3Sb5. Scanning tunneling microscopy down to deep cryogenic temperature of 50 mK reveals two previously unreported charge density wave orders in the Sb surface. Density functional theory confirms that one of them is coupled to a spin density wave with an altermagnetic ground state. The charge density waves can be tuned in both amplitude and phase by an external magnetic field, reflected in domain switching and stripe sliding of the charge density wave. Our findings deepen the understanding of symmetry-breaking in kagome systems, providing a tunable platform to explore the interplay of electronic correlation with emergent quantum magnetism.</p>

The resulting model introduces a parameter that quantifies the strain modulation, thereby providing a transparent approach to analyze the role of dislocation strain in leading to flat band formation.</p>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are transforming materials science and engineering by enabling the study of complex phenomena, such as those critical to battery operation. In this work, we benchmark the MACE machine learning model against a well-trained DeePMD potential for predicting interstitial lithium diffusivity in LiF, a key component in the solid electrolyte interphase in Li ion batteries. Our results demonstrate that the MACE-MPA-0 foundational model achieves comparable accuracy to well-trained DeePMD, in predicting key diffusion properties based on molecular dynamics simulation, while requiring minimal or no training data. For instance, the MACE-MPA-0 predicts an activation energy Ea of 0.22 eV, the fine-tuned model with only 300 data points predicts Ea = 0.20 eV, both of which show good agreement with the DeePMD model reference value of Ea = 0.24 eV. In this work, we provide a solid test case where fine-tuning approaches - whether using data generated for DeePMD or data produced by the foundational MACE model itself - yield similar robust performance to the DeePMD potential trained with over 40,000 actively learned data, albeit requiring only a fraction of the training data.</p>

            <p>Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) can potentially offer exceptional material properties, but their complex, costly manufacturing limits their scalability. Chemical complexity and complex manufacturing processes lead to the formation of some secondary phases, which have a significant impact on the final properties. In this work, chromium compound dispersoid enhancements (Cr- oxides and carbides) were formed in CoCrFeNi MPEAs to enhance their microstructural and high-temperature mechanical properties. A single FCC phase was observed in the arc melted (AM) samples, chromium oxides were detected in the gas-atomized (GA) samples, and Cr2O3 with Cr23C6 or Cr7C3 was found in the mechanically alloyed (MA)samples depending on the sintering temperature. Mechanical tests at room temperature and 575Â°C, where no phase evolution is expected, showed that the GA samples with oxides achieved enhanced mechanical properties at 575Â°C. This was co-induced by precipitation strengthening, recrystallization suppression, and twinning-induced plasticity. The MA samples with carbides exhibited high strength but low ductility, with Cr7C3 outperforming Cr23C6 because of its lower hardness and twinning effects. This work links chromium compound evolution to mechanical performance of MPEAs, offering insights to optimize HEA production for high-temperature applications through controlled phase formation.</p>

            <p>The formulation of a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory for interacting particles is a crucial step in the theoretical description of liquids. The microscopic mappings proposed decades ago by Dean and Kawasaki have played a central role in the analytical treatment of such problems. However, the singular mathematical nature of the density distributions used in these derivations raises concerns about the validity and practical utility of the resulting stochastic partial differential equations, particularly for direct numerical simulations. Recent efforts have centered on establishing a rigorous coarse-graining procedure to regularize the effective Dean-Kawasaki equation. Building on this foundation, we numerically investigate weakly interacting fluids within such a regularized framework for the first time. Our work reveals, at the level of structural correlations, the effects of regularization on the Dean-Kawasaki formalism and paves the way for improved numerical approaches to simulate fluctuating hydrodynamics in liquids.</p>

            <p>Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.</p>

Further experiments on binary hydrogen isotope mixtures validated numerical predictions of the separation efficiency for T2. Specifically, the high selectivity for tritium over protium of 38.2 makes the Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite an excellent candidate for energy-efficient isotope separation at liquid-nitrogen temperature.</p>

            <p>Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is recognized as a readily available, mechanically sufficient construction and demolition waste product that is suitable as a base course substitute for natural, virgin aggregate in pavement construction. Environmentally responsible applications of RCA must consider the high alkalinity, high pH leachate, and heavy metal leaching risks reported in the literature. The existing body of literature does not address discrepancies between field and laboratory measurements of RCA leachate pH, nor are there any existing studies of aged RCA leachate composition as a function of time. To consider the influence of contact time on RCA leachate, the present study evaluates recovered RCA base course samples from the Minnesota Road Research highway construction study site using modified batch test methodology. Leachate pH, alkalinity, and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration were monitored for 24 hours to understand RCA leachate chemistry during the initial contact period. Leachate pH is high upon initial contact with water (pH > 10) and decreases over time as it reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Calcium ion concentration increases rapidly in the initial contact period, then more gradually as calcium saturation is reached. Alkalinity stabilizes (50-65 mg CaCO3/L) after a dramatic increase during the initial contact period.</p>

            <p>Aluminum is a widely used alloy, which is susceptible to fatigue failure. Characterizing fatigue performance for materials is extremely time and cost demanding, especially for high cycle data. To help mitigate this, a transfer learning based framework has been developed using Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) in which a source LSTM model is trained based on pure axial fatigue data for Aluminum 7075-T6 alloy which is then transferred to predict high cycle torsional S-N curves. The framework was able to accurately predict Al torsional S-N curves for a much higher cycle range. It is the belief that this framework will help to drastically mitigate the cost of gathering fatigue characteristics for different materials and help prioritize tests with better cost and time constraints.</p>

The both of these events are tightly related to the Bogoliubov theory of superfluidity (1947). The existence of condensate in the system of interacting bosons is the key ansatz of this theory. Therefore, the experiments started in JINR in 1975 confirmed this prediction of the Bogoliubov theory that superfluidity of the liquid 4He (He II) should emerge at the same time as the Bose-Einstein condensation.</p>

            <p>We provide a holographic prescription to compute real-time thermal correlators with arbitrary operator ordering. In field theory, these correlation functions are captured by a multi-fold Schwinger-Keldysh time contour. We propose a holographic dual for these contours, which generalizes the gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh geometry previously advocated in the literature. Our geometry consists of multiple AdS-black holes glued together at the future and past horizons, with matching conditions determined by unitarity and the KMS condition. As a proof of concept, we solve for a probe scalar field in this geometry and compute bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary propagators, in terms of which we evaluate the 4-point functions at tree-level. We show that in perturbation theory, the lowest-order diagrams that contribute non-trivially to the out-of-time order four-point function are exchange diagrams which explore the full four-fold geometry. Furthermore, these diagrams reduce to a simple factorized expression. We propose a conjecture on the structure of higher order observables and provide a partial proof by studying a subset of the contributing diagrams.</p>

            <p>A successful deep learning network is highly dependent not only on the training dataset, but the training algorithm used to condition the network for a given task. The loss function, dataset, and tuning of hyperparameters all play an essential role in training a network, yet there is not much discussion on the reliability or reproducibility of a training algorithm. With the rise in popularity of physics-informed loss functions, this raises the question of how reliable one's loss function is in conditioning a network to enforce a particular boundary condition. Reporting the model variation is needed to assess a loss function's ability to consistently train a network to obey a given boundary condition, and provides a fairer comparison among different methods. In this work, a Pix2Pix network predicting the stress fields of high elastic contrast composites is used as a case study. Several different loss functions enforcing stress equilibrium are implemented, with each displaying different levels of variation in convergence, accuracy, and enforcing stress equilibrium across many training sessions. Suggested practices in reporting model variation are also shared.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Hutchcroft</p>
            <p>Statistical mechanical systems at and near their points of phase transition are expected to exhibit rich, fractal-like behaviour that is independent of the small-scale details of the system but depends strongly on the dimension in which the model is defined. Moreover, many models are conjectured to have an upper critical dimension with important quantitative and qualitative differences between critical behaviour at, above, and below the upper critical dimension. For models with long-range interactions, one expects additional transitions between effectively long-range and effectively short-range regimes, with further marginal effects on the boundary of these two regimes, leading to (at least) eight qualitatively distinct forms of critical behaviour in total for each given model. We give a broad overview of these conjectures aimed at a general mathematical audience before surveying the significant recent progress that has been made towards understanding them in the context of long-range percolation.</p>

We present an efficient solution that helps to achieve the scaling limit, e.g., of the current decay with lattice length. As an example, we study the super--diffusive--to--diffusive transition in a lattice with long--range hopping and dephasing. The approach enables calculations with up to $10^4$ sites, representing an increase of $10$ to $40$ times over prior studies. This enables a more precise extraction of the diffusion exponent, enhances agreement with theoretical results, and supports the presence of a phase transition. There is a wide range of problems that have Markovian relaxation, noise, and driving. They include quantum networks for machine--learning--based classification and extended reservoir approaches (ERAs) for transport. The results here will be useful for these classes of problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atis Yosprakob, Wei-Lin Tu, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Kouichi Okunishi, Donghoon Kim</p>
            <p>Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor network (TN) states have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can significantly reduce entanglement, mitigating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, imposing the natural Grassmann-evenness constraint on the Clifford circuits significantly reduces the number of disentangling gates, from 720 to just 32, yielding a far more efficient implementation. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>Localized quantum emitters in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as solid-state candidates for on-demand sources of single photons. Due to the role of strain in the site-selective creation of TMD emitters, their hybrid integration into photonic structures such as cavities and waveguides is possible using pick-and-place methods. Here we investigate quantum emission from a hybrid structure consisting of a monolayer of WSe2 interfaced with horizontally aligned InP nanowires (NWs). Our experiments reveal multiple narrow and bright emission peaks in the 715-785 nm spectral range and g(2)(0) as low as 0.049, indicating strong antibunching and good single photon purity. The faceted nature of III-V NWs provides unique opportunities for strain engineering, including the potential for placement of emitters on the top surface for optimal coupling. Our findings pave the way for realizing hybrid quantum light sources for integrated quantum photonics that could combine III-V quantum dots with TMD emitters into a single platform.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeongwoo Jae, Junghee Ryu, Hoon Ryu</p>
            <p>We employ the operational quasiprobability (OQ) as a work distribution, which reproduces the Jarzynski equality and yields the average work consistent with the classical definition. The OQ distribution can be experimentally implemented through the end-point measurement and the two-point measurement scheme. Using this framework, we demonstrate the explicit contribution of coherence to the fluctuation, the average, and the second moment of work. In a two-level system, we show that non-joint measurability, a generalized notion of measurement incompatibility, can increase the amount of extractable work beyond the classical bound imposed by jointly measurable measurements. We further prove that the real part of Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) and the OQ are equivalent in two-level systems, and they are nonnegative for binary unbiased measurements if and only if the measurements are jointly measurable. In a three-level Nitrogen-vacancy center system, the OQ and the KDQ exhibit different amounts of negativities while enabling the same work extraction, implying that the magnitude of negativity is not a faithful indicator of nonclassical work. These results highlight that coherence and non-joint measurability play fundamental roles in the enhancement of work.</p>

            <h2>Probing Geometry of Next Token Prediction Using Cumulant Expansion of the Softmax Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karthik Viswanathan, Sang Eon Park</p>
            <p>We introduce a cumulant-expansion framework for quantifying how large language models (LLMs) internalize higher-order statistical structure during next-token prediction. By treating the softmax entropy of each layer's logit distribution as a perturbation around its "center" distribution, we derive closed-form cumulant observables that isolate successively higher-order correlations. Empirically, we track these cumulants in GPT-2 and Pythia models on Pile-10K prompts. (i) Structured prompts exhibit a characteristic rise-and-plateau profile across layers, whereas token-shuffled prompts remain flat, revealing the dependence of the cumulant profile on meaningful context. (ii) During training, all cumulants increase monotonically before saturating, directly visualizing the model's progression from capturing variance to learning skew, kurtosis, and higher-order statistical structures. (iii) Mathematical prompts show distinct cumulant signatures compared to general text, quantifying how models employ fundamentally different processing mechanisms for mathematical versus linguistic content. Together, these results establish cumulant analysis as a lightweight, mathematically grounded probe of feature-learning dynamics in high-dimensional neural networks.</p>

            <p>Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.</p>

            <p>The ability to precisely control and predict the evolution of quantum states is a fundamental requirement for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we develop tunable atomic routing protocols based on an integrable model of dipolar bosons confined in a four-well potential with a star-shaped configuration. By adjusting the system parameters, we identify a harmonic dynamical regime of the atomic population that can be treated analytically, providing a complete description of the system's behaviour for precise manipulation. We demonstrate three independent modes of control over the atomic population dynamics under the action of an external field: frequency tuning via variation in the field intensity, directional switching via spatial displacement of the field, and amplitude modulation by varying its duration. These modes operate under two distinct configurations: one source and two drains, and, in reverse order, two sources and one drain. These cases emulate an atomic 1:2 demultiplexer and 2:1 multiplexer, respectively. Our results may contribute to the development of control mechanisms in the design of quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) provides a versatile framework for both quantum information processing and probing many-body entanglement. We reveal a fundamental tension between the error-correcting power of an AQEC and the hardness of code state preparation.

These results offer a powerful tool for exploring quantum circuit complexity across diverse settings. As applications, we derive stronger constraints on the complexity of AQEC codes with transversal logical gates and establish strong complexity lower bounds for W state preparation. Our framework also provides a novel perspective for systems with Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type constraints.</p>

            <p>Isospectrally patterned lattices (IPL) have recently been shown to exhibit a rich band structure comprising both regimes of localized as well as extended states. The localized states show a single center localization behaviour with a characteristic localization length. We derive a continuum analogue of the IPL which allows us to determine analytically its eigenvalue spectrum and eigenstates thereby obtaining an expression for the localization length which involves the ratio of the coupling among the cells of the lattice and the phase gradient across the lattice. This continuum model breaks chiral symmetry but still shows a pairing of partner states with positive and negative energies except for the ground state. We perform a corresponding symmetry analysis which illuminates the continuum models structure as compared to a corresponding chirally symmetric Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Noncommutativity of observables is a central feature of quantum physics. It plays a fundamental role in the formulation of the uncertainty principle for complementary variables and strongly affects the laws of thermodynamics for systems with noncommuting, that is, non-Abelian, conserved quantities. We here derive nonequilibrium generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics in the form of fluctuation relations, both for mechanically and thermally driven quantum systems. We identify a non-Abelian contribution to the energy and entropy balances, without which these relations would be violated. The latter term can be controlled to enhance both work extraction and nonequilibrium currents compared to what is obtained in commuting thermodynamics. These findings demonstrate that noncommutativity maybe a useful thermodynamic resource.</p>

We also show that, due to its variational nature, DMRG provides an ideal tool to benchmark accuracy domains, as well as the performance of new hardware developments and related numerical libraries. Detailed numerical error analysis and performance assessment are also presented for subcomponents of the DMRG algebra by systematically interpolating between double- and pseudo-half-precision. Our analyis represents the first quantum chemistry evaluation of FP64 emulation for correlated calculations capable of achieving chemical accuracy and emulation based on fixed-point arithmetic, and it paves the way for the utilization of state-of-the-art Blackwell technology in tree-like tensor network state electronic structure calculations, opening new research directions in materials sciences and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Information-thermodynamic bounds on precision in interacting quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Honma, Tan Van Vu</p>
            <p>The thermodynamic uncertainty relation quantifies a trade-off between the relative fluctuations of trajectory currents and the thermodynamic cost, indicating that the current precision is fundamentally constrained by entropy production. In classical bipartite systems, it has been shown that information flow between subsystems can enhance the current precision alongside thermodynamic dissipation. In this study, we investigate how information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects jointly constrain current fluctuations within a subsystem of interacting quantum systems. Unlike classical bipartite systems, quantum subsystems can exhibit simultaneous state changes and maintain quantum coherence, which fundamentally alters the precision-dissipation trade-off. For this general setting, we derive a quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation for interacting multipartite systems, establishing a thermodynamic trade-off between current fluctuations, information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects. Our analysis shows that, in addition to local dissipation, both information exchange and quantum coherence play essential roles in suppressing current fluctuations. These results have important implications for the performance of quantum thermal machines, such as information-thermodynamic engines and quantum clocks. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations on two representative models: an autonomous quantum Maxwell's demon and a quantum clock. These results extend uncertainty relations to multipartite open quantum systems and elucidate the functional role of information flow in fluctuation suppression.</p>

Additionally, the integration of machine learning is discussed as a transformative tool for signal decoding, environmental compensation, and adaptive calibration. We also identify key challenges, cross sensitivity, signal drift, material degradation, and deployment at the edge and review recent strategies to address them.

            <p>The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>The spin-polarized surface states in topological insulators offer unique transport characteristics that make them distinguishable from trivial conductors. Here, we detect the impact of these surface states in the topological insulator BiSbTeSe$_{2}$ by electrical means using a non-local transport configuration with ferromagnetic Co/Al$_2$O$_3$ electrodes. We show that the non-local measurement allows to probe the surface currents flowing along the whole surface, i.e.~from the top along the side to the bottom surface and back to the top surface along the opposite side. Increasing the temperature increases the interaction between bulk and surface states, which shortens this non-local current path along the surface and hence leads to a complete disappearance of the non-local signal at around 20K. Interestingly, we observe that the ratio between spin signal to background signal is much larger in the non-local geometry compared to the local one. Given that the observed ratio in the non-local geometry aligns well with expectations for spin-polarized surface states, our findings suggest that an as-yet unresolved mechanism diminishes the spin signal in the local geometry.</p>

            <p>The spectral form factor is a dynamical probe for level statistics of quantum systems. The early-time behaviour is commonly interpreted as a characterization of two-point correlations at large separation. We argue that this interpretation can be too restrictive by indicating that the self-correlation imposes a constraint on the spectral form factor integrated over time. More generally, we indicate that each expansion coefficient of the two-point correlation function imposes a constraint on the properly weighted time-integrated spectral form factor. We discuss how these constraints can affect the interpretation of the spectral form factor as a probe for ergodicity. We propose a new probe, which eliminates the effect of the constraint imposed by the self-correlation. The use of this probe is demonstrated for a model of randomly incomplete spectra and a Floquet model supporting many-body localization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hideaki Maebashi, Chandra M. Varma</p>
            <p>We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum xy model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in MoirÃ© twisted bi-layer graphene and bi-layer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear in temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those due to Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln \omega_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi-surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi-surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</p>

            <p>The interplay among Coulomb interaction, electron-phonon coupling, and phonon-phonon coupling has a significant impact on the low-energy behavior of three-dimensional type-I tilted Dirac semimetals. To investigate this phenomenon, we construct an effective theory, calculate one-loop corrections arising from all these interactions, and establish the coupled energy-dependent flows of all associated interaction parameters by adopting the renormalization-group approach. Deciphering such coupled evolutions allows us to determine a series of low-energy critical properties for these materials. At first, we present the low-energy tendencies of all interaction parameters. The tilting parameter exhibits distinct tendencies that depend heavily upon the initial anisotropy of fermion velocities. In comparison, the latter is mainly dominated by its initial value but is less sensitive to the former. Variations in these two quantities drive certain interaction parameters toward the strong anisotropy in the low-energy regime, indicating the screened interaction in specific directions, and others toward an approximate isotropy. Additionally, we observe that the tendencies of interaction parameters can be qualitatively clustered into three distinct types of fixed points, accompanied by the potential instabilities that induce an interaction-driven phase transition to a certain superconducting state. Furthermore, approaching these fixed points leads to the critical behavior of physical quantities, such as the density of states, compressibility, and specific heat, which exhibit quite different from their noninteracting counterparts and even deviate slightly from Fermi-liquid behavior. Our investigation sheds light on the intricate relationship between different types of interactions in these semimetals and provides useful insights into their fundamental properties.</p>

            <p>This study focuses on amorphous boron nitride ($\rm \alpha$-BN) as a novel diffusion barrier for advanced semiconductor technology, particularly addressing the critical challenge of copper diffusion in back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnects. Owing to its ultralow dielectric constant and robust barrier properties, $\rm \alpha$-BN is examined as an alternative to conventional low-k dielectrics. The investigation primarily employs theoretical modelling, using a Gaussian Approximation Potential, to simulate and understand the atomic-level interactions. This machine learning-based approach allows the performance of realistic simulations of amorphous structure of $\rm \alpha$-BN, enabling the exploration of the impact of different film morphologies on barrier efficacy. Furthermore, we studied the electronic and optical properties of the films using a simple Tight-Binding model. In addition to the theoretical studies, we performed diffusion studies of copper through PECVD $\rm \alpha$-BN on Si. The results from both the theoretical and experimental investigations highlight the potential of $\rm \alpha$-BN as a highly effective diffusion barrier, suitable for integration in nanoelectronics. This research shows that $\rm \alpha$-BN is a promising candidate for BEOL interconnects but also demonstrates the synergy of advanced computational models and experimental methods in material innovation for semiconductor applications.</p>

            <h2>Active pattern formation emergent from single-species nonreciprocity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Feng Huang, Michael te Vrugt, Jonas Mayer Martins, Raphael Wittkowski, Hartmut LÃ¶wen</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocal interactions violating Newton's third law are common in a plethora of nonequilibrium situations ranging from predator-prey systems to the swarming of birds and effective colloidal interactions under flow. While many recent studies have focused on two species with nonreciprocal coupling, less is examined for the basic single-component system breaking the actio and reactio equality of force within the same species. Here, we systematically derive a field theory for the case of single-species nonreciprocal interactions from the microscopic particle dynamics, leading to a generic continuum model termed Active Model N (N denoting nonreciprocity). We explore the rich dynamics of pattern formation in this nonreciprocal system and the emergence of self-traveling states with persistent variation and flowing of active branched patterns. One particular new characteristic pattern is an interwoven self-knitting "yarn" structure with a unique feature of simultaneous development of micro- and bulk phase separations. The growth dynamics of a "ball-of-wool" active droplet towards these self-knitted yarn or branched states exhibits a crossover between different scaling behaviors. The mechanism underlying this distinct class of active phase separation is attributed to the interplay between nonreciprocity and competition of interparticle forces. Our predictions can be applied to various biological and artificial active matter systems controlled by single-species nonreciprocity.</p>

            <p>We present Ir $4f$ core-level hard-x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) experiments conducted across antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering transition in Ruddlesden-Popper iridates Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. The Ir $4f$ spectra exhibit distinct changes between the AFM and paramagnetic (PM) phases, with the spectral difference $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ showing a contrasting behavior in the two compounds. By employing computational simulations using the local-density approximation combined with the dynamical mean-field theory method, we elucidate that $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ primary reflects the Slater or Mott-Hubbard character of the AFM insulating state rather than material specific details. This sensitivity to fine low-energy electronic structure arises from the dependence of charge-transfer responses to the sudden creation of a localized core hole on both metal-insulator transitions and long-range AFM ordering. Our result broadens the applications of core-level HAXPES as a tool for characterization of electronic structure.</p>

Here, we show that this symmetry breaks down in curved (non-Euclidean) 1D circuits defined on spherical 2DEGs. We demonstrate that this is a consequence of parallel spin transport and holonomy on the surface of the sphere, and that a symmetric response can be recovered when considering the parallel transport condition as an offset shifting the AC pattern. We discuss 1D triangular circuits defined along geodesic arcs on the sphere as a case study, and generalize it to regular polygons and parallel curves of given latitude.</p>

            <p>Developing tailored semiconductor heterostructures on demand represents a critical capability for addressing the escalating performance demands in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, traditional fabrication methods remain constrained by simulation-based design and iterative trial-and-error optimization. Here, we introduce SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to perform multi-step semiconductor heterostructure growth through in-situ monitoring and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard MBE reactors, physics-informed machine learning (ML) models, and parameter initialization, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the optimization of high-density InAs quantum dot (QD) growth with a target emission wavelength of 1240 nm, showcasing the power of SemiEpi. We achieve a QD density of 5 x 10^10 cm^-2, a 1.6-fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and a reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV, leveraging in-situ reflective high-energy electron diffraction monitoring with feedback control for adjusting growth temperatures. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step heterostructure growth, facilitate the development of a hardware-independent framework, and enhance process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</p>

            <p>Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via strong, exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions perturbatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. Our findings are confirmed here via the first detailed analysis of a 4-cylinder vdW model. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Our results suggest that a non-perturbative calculation will be required for reliable prediction of dispersion interactions in these ubiquitous systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anastasiya Lebedeva, MatÃºÅ¡ HladkÃ½, Marcel PolÃ¡k, FrantiÅ¡ek Herman</p>
            <p>Nowadays Nb-based superconducting radio-frequency cavities represent fundamental tools used for (Standard Model) particle acceleration, (beyond Standard Model) particle probing, and long-lifetime photon preservation. We study the SRF frequency shift in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$ and the quality factor mainly at low temperatures within the Dynes superconductor model. We scrutinize and use the local limit response to the external electromagnetic field. Our approach allows for a finer analysis of the peculiar behavior of the resonant frequency shift immensely close to $T_c$, observed in recent experiments. In several regimes, we analytically elaborate on the width and depth of the resulting dip. Studying the sign of the slope of the resonant frequency shift at $T_c$ in the moderately clean regime clarifies the role of the pair-breaking and pair-conserving disorder. Next, to find the relevance of our description, we compare and also fit our results with the recent experimental data from the N-doped Nb sample presented by Zarea {\it et al.} [Front. Supercond. Mater. 3, 1 (2023), arXiv:2307.07905]. Our analysis complies with the experimental findings, especially concerning the dip width. We offer a straightforward, homogeneous-disorder-based interpretation within the moderately clean regime. Comparative analysis for three other cavities with different resonant frequencies reported by Ueki {\it et al.} [Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 5, 053I02 (2025), arXiv:2207.14236] points toward a similar regime. Assuming the same regime at low temperatures, we address details of the high-quality plateaus. Summing all up, this work presents (and studies the limits of) the simple, effective description of the complex problem corresponding to the electromagnetic response in the superconductors, combining homogeneous conventional pairing and two different kinds of disorder scattering.</p>

The results also serve to quantify the limitations of existing analyses, wherein viscous effects and the actual geometries of the pre-existing cracks and the specimens are neglected.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Faulconnier, S. Job, J. Brocail, N. Peyret, J.-L. Dion</p>
            <p>This article explores the hysteretic behavior and the damping features of sheared granular media using discrete element method (DEM) simulations. We consider polydisperse non-cohesive frictional spherical particles, enclosed in a container with rigid but moving walls, submitted to a cyclic simple shear superimposed to a confining pressure. The mechanical response of the grains is analyzed in the permanent regime, by fitting the macroscopic stress-strain relation applied to the box with a Dahl-like elasto-frictional model. The influence of several parameters such as the amplitude of the strain, the confining pressure, the elasticity, the friction coefficient, the size and the number of particles are explored. We find that the fitted parameters of our macroscopic Ansatz qualitatively rely on both a well-established effective medium theory of confined granular media and a well-documented rheology of granular flow. Quantitatively, we demonstrate that the single degree-of-freedom elasto-frictional reduced model reliably describes the nonlinear response of the granular layer over a wide range of operating conditions. In particular, we show that the mechanical response of a granular slab under simple shear depends on an unique dimensionless parameter, akin to an effective Coulomb threshold, at low shear/high pressure. Further, exploring higher shear/lower pressure, we evidence an optimal damping at the crossover between a loose unjammed regime and a dense elastic regime.</p>

            <p>Models of coupled binary elements capture memory effects in complex dissipative materials, such as transient responses or sequential computing, when their interactions are chosen appropriately. However, for random interactions, self-loops - cyclic transition sequences incompatible with dissipative dynamics - dominate the response and undermine statistical approaches. Here we reveal that self-loops originate from energy injection and limit cycles in the underlying physical system. We furthermore introduce interaction ensembles that strongly suppress or completely eliminate self-loops, allowing statistical studies of memory in large dissipative systems. Our work opens a route towards a unified description of passive and active multistable materials using hysteron models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harsimranjit Kaur, Kuldeep Suthar</p>
            <p>The ultracold atoms are an ideal platform to implement atomtronics and Josephson junctions analogous to superconducting circuits. The collective modes of a Bose gas split by a potential barrier have been known. However, the role of barriers on the collective excitation spectra of ultracold atomic mixtures has not been examined. Here, we examine the low-lying collective modes of (an)harmonically trapped quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in a Josephson barrier by employing the variational approach and Bogoliubov theory. We first show that the anharmonicity of the external potential leads to an increase in the critical barrier strength of mode softening in a single-species condensate. The Josephson barrier drives the softening of in-phase and out-of-phase dipole modes of two-species Bose-Einstein condensates, and consequently leads to two additional zero-energy Goldstone modes in the miscible phase, in agreement with the variational approach. Furthermore, the sandwich immiscible state results in an additional Goldstone mode due to the barrier, in contrast to the spatially symmetry-broken side-by-side profile. Our results unveil the distinct collective response of the Josephson barrier in binary mixtures owing to interspecies atomic correlations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianghua Su, Xiping Fu, Yang He, Ying Shang, Kaiyuan Ji, Linghua Wen</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the crucial factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength. This is in stark contrast to the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction and the Raman-induced SOC. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, Rydberg interactions, and nonlinear contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures, including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system.</p>

            <h2>Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow that maximizes the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action calculated between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</p>

            <h2>Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Semsi Coskun, Davood Damircheli, Robert Lipton</p>
            <p>A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with thermodynamics. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> RubÃ©n GÃ³mez GonzÃ¡lez, Vicente GarzÃ³</p>
            <p>The Boltzmann kinetic equation is considered to compute the transport coefficients associated with the mass flux of intruders in a granular gas. Intruders and granular gas are immersed in a gas of elastic hard spheres (molecular gas). We assume that the granular particles are sufficiently rarefied so that the state of the molecular gas is not affected by the presence of the granular gas. Thus, the gas of elastic hard spheres can be considered as a thermostat (or bath) at a fixed temperature $T_g$. In the absence of spatial gradients, the system achieves a steady state where the temperature of the granular gas $T$ differs from that of the intruders $T_0$ (energy nonequipartition). Approximate theoretical predictions for the temperature ratio $T_0/T_g$ and the kurtosis $c_0$ associated with the intruders compare very well with Monte Carlo simulations for conditions of practical interest. For states close to the steady homogeneous state, the Boltzmann equation for the intruders is solved by means of the Chapman--Enskog method to first order in the spatial gradients. As expected, the diffusion transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations which are approximately solved by considering the first-Sonine approximation. In dimensionless form, the transport coefficients are nonlinear functions of the mass and diameter ratios, the coefficients of restitution, and the (reduced) bath temperature. Interestingly, previous results derived from a suspension model based on an effective fluid-solid interaction force are recovered when $m/m_g\to \infty$ and $m_0/m_g\to \infty$, where $m$, $m_0$, and $m_g$ are the masses of the granular, intruders, and molecular gas particle, respectively. Finally, as an application of our results, thermal diffusion segregation is exhaustively analysed.</p>

            <p>Non-equilibrium transport and phonon branch-resolved size effects in single-layer graphene materials are studied under a multi-temperature kinetic model, which is developed for capturing the branch-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Compared with typical macroscopic multi-temperature models, the assumption of diffusive phonon transport is abandoned in this model and replaced by the free migration and scattering of particles. The phonon branch- and size-dependent effective thermal conductivity is predicted in nanosized graphene as well as the temperature slips near the boundaries. Compared with other phonon branches, the ZA branch contributes the most to thermal conduction regardless of system sizes. Furthermore, in nanosized homogeneous graphene with a hotspot at the center, the branch-dependent thermal conductivity increases from the inside to the outside even if the system size is fixed. The thermal conductivity of ZA branch is even higher than the lattice thermal conductivity when the system size is hundreds of nanometers.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study the noncollinear magnetic texture effect on second-order topological superconductor (SOTSC) phase generated in unconventional $d$-wave superconductors and two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI). While the interplay of the $d$-wave superconductor and QSHI has been studied as a platform to realize Majorana corner modes (MCMs), we show that the addition of the spin texture enables the tunability of these MCMs. Each corner of this hybrid system can host one or two Majorana modes depending on the system parameters, in particular, exchange strength and pitch vector of the spin texture. To characterize the higher order bulk topology, we compute the quadrupolar winding number, which directly corresponds to the number of MCMs acquiring a value of one for four corner modes and two for eight corner modes. We investigate and show the close resemblance in the topological phase diagrams obtained from the low energy effective Hamiltonian that reveals an emergent in-plane Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling induced by the spin texture, and the real space tight binding lattice model. The microscopic pairing mechanism responsible for the appearance of SOTSC phase is investigated via an effective bulk pairing analysis, while a low-energy edge theory captures the mechanism behind tunability of MCMs. Our result paves the way for realizing SOTC with multiple MCMs which can be tuned via system parameters.</p>

We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical experiments.</p>

While originally attributed to the spin Hall effect and spin Rashba-Edelstein effect, recent discoveries related to orbital moments induced by the orbital Hall effect and the orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect have added complexity to the comprehension of the switching process in non-magnet/ferromagnet bilayers. Addressing this challenge, we present a quantitative investigation of a Pt/Co bilayer by employing atomistic spin dynamics simulations, incorporating the proximity-induced moments of Pt, as well as electrically induced spin and orbital moments obtained from first-principles calculations. Our layer-resolved model elucidates the damping-like and field-like nature of the induced moments by separating them according to their even and odd magnetization dependence. In addition to demonstrating that a larger field-like spin-orbit torque contribution comes from previously disregarded induced orbital moments, our work highlights the necessity of considering interactions with Pt induced moments at the interface, as they contribute significantly to the switching dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Emergent curved space and gravitational lensing in quantum materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yugo Onishi, Nisarga Paul, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>We show that an effective gravitational field naturally emerges in quantum materials with long-wavelength spin (or pseudospin) textures. When the itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation. The emergent curved space gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of the gravitational lensing. The lensing effect can appear in systems without (emergent) magnetic fields, such as those with coplanar spin textures. Our work shows that novel ``gravitational'' phenomena generically appear in quantum systems due to nonadiabaticity, opening new research directions in quantum physics.</p>

            <p>We numerically investigate the steady shear rheology of mixtures of active and passive Brownian particles, with varying fractions of active components. We find that even a small fraction of active dopants triggers fluidization with comparable efficiency to fully active systems. A combined parameter, active energy, given by dopant fraction multiplied by propulsion speed squared controls the steady shear rheology and glass transition of the active-passive mixtures. These results together provide a quantitative strategy for fine-tuning the mechanical properties of a soft material with small amounts of active dopants.</p>

            <h2>Beyond characteristic equations: A unified one-dimensional non-Bloch band theory via wavefunction data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoshu Li</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems play a central role in nonequilibrium physics, where determining the energy spectrum under open boundary conditions is a fundamental problem. Non-Bloch band theory, based on the characteristic equation $\text{det}[E - H(\beta)] = 0$, has emerged as a key tool for this task. However, we show that this framework becomes insufficient in systems with certain symmetries, where identical characteristic equations can yield different spectra. To resolve this, we develop a unified theory that incorporates additional wavefunction information beyond the characteristic equation. Our framework accurately captures spectral properties such as the energy spectrum and the end-to-end signal response in a broad class of systems, particularly those with high symmetry. It reveals the essential role of wavefunction information and symmetry in shaping non-Hermitian band theory.</p>

            <h2>Giant orbital magnetization in two-dimensional materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Ovesen, Thomas Olsen</p>
            <p>Orbital magnetization typically plays a minor role in compounds where the magnetic properties are governed by transition metal elements. However, in some cases, the orbital magnetization may be fully unquenched, which can have dramatic consequences for magnetic anisotropy and various magnetic response properties. In the present work, we start by summarizing how unquenched orbital moments arise from particular combinations of crystal field splitting and orbital filling. We exemplify this for the cases of two-dimensional (2D) VI$_3$ and FePS$_3$, and show that Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling are crucial ingredients for predicting correct orbital moments from first principles calculations. We then search the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) for monolayers having tetrahedral or octahedral crystal field splitting of transition metal $d$-states and orbital occupancy that is expected to lead to large orbital moments. We identify 112 monolayers with octahedral crystal field splitting and 62 monolayers with tetrahedral crystal field splitting and for materials with partially filled $t_{2g}$ bands, we verify that inclusion of Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling typically increases the magnitude of predicted orbital moments by an order of magnitude.</p>

            <p>Triple-fold or pseudospin-1 semimetals belong to a class of multi-fold materials in which linearly dispersive bands and flat bands intersect at the same point, forming triple-fold crossing points. We conduct an analytical investigation of topologically protected Fermi arc surface states and finite-size effects in three-dimensional (3D) triple-fold and doubly degenerate triple-fold semimetals in continuum low-energy models. Higher topological charge of the triple-fold crossing points leads to two Fermi arcs connecting the nodes. For a single triple-fold crossing point, we found that no term in the Hamiltonian with momentum-independent elements can open a gap, prompting us to consider doubly-degenerate triple-fold fermions, where the gap can be opened by mixing the degenerate copies. Thin films of triple-fold semimetals allow for mixing between the surface and bulk states in addition to the discretization of energy levels of the latter.</p>

            <p>Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors such as \b{eta}-Ga2O3 are ideal materials for next-generation power electronic devices. Electronic and mechanical properties of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 can be tuned by alloying with other sesquioxides, notably Al2O3 and In2O3. Moreover, by tuning the In content of a (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloy, its lattice constants can be matched to those of Ga2O3, while preserving a large conduction-band offset. In view of potential applications to \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.</p>

            <p>Nanostructuring materials at small scales enables control over their physical properties, revealing behaviors not observed at larger dimensions. This strategy is particularly effective in two-dimensional (2D) materials, where surface effects dominate, and has been applied in the thermoelectric field. Here, we use multilayer graphene (4-6 nm thick) as a test platform to study the effect of nanomeshing on its thermoelectric properties. The nanomesh consists of a hexagonal array of holes, with a measured diameter and neck-width of ~360 nm and ~160 nm, respectively. The multilayer graphene is integrated into field-effect transistor-like devices supported by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), allowing simultaneous electric and thermoelectric measurements, with nanomeshing applied to only part of the material. We use modulated thermoreflectance to investigate thermal transport in equivalent nanomeshed and pristine graphene flakes, extracting key parameters that affect thermoelectric performance. The nanomesh geometry suppresses thermal transport without significantly impacting charge transport, highlighting the different scattering lengths of phonons and electrons while enhancing the thermopower response. We observe a twofold improvement in the device power factor, PF = S^2 sigma (with S the Seebeck coefficient and sigma the electrical conductivity), at room temperature, along with a nearly threefold reduction in thermal conductivity k. The results show that nanomeshing can significantly improve the thermoelectric performance of multilayer graphene, paving the way for novel energy conversion strategies using 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Zeeman-activated Berry curvature magnetotransport from the bulk of non-magnetic metals with inversion symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rhonald Burgos Atencia, Antonio Vecchione, Denys Makarov, Carmine Ortix</p>
            <p>The Berry curvature (BC), a quantity encoding the geometry of electronic wavefunctions, governs various electronic transport effects in quantum materials. In magnetic systems, the BC is reponsible for the intrinsic part of the anomalous Hall conductivity. Local concentrations of BC in non-centrosymmetric materials can lead instead to the quantum nonlinear Hall effect. Here, we argue that the bulk of non-magnetic metals with inversion symmetry, systems where the BC is forced to vanish at any momentum, can be endowed with substantial concentrations of BC even with an infinitesimally small Zeeman coupling. This Zeeman-activated BC, independent of the magnetic field strength and instead related to the degree of non-parabolicity of the electronic bands, couples to the electronic orbital motion to generate a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance that scales with the relaxation time as the Drude resistivity. We show that the Zeeman-actived BC and the related intrinsic negative magnetoresistivity are generic: they appear in all centrosymmetric point groups and can occur both in topological and conventional conductors.</p>

            <p>In the presence of a laminar shear flow, the diffusion of passive colloidal particles is enhanced in the direction parallel to the flow. This classical phenomenon is known as Taylor-Aris dispersion. Besides, microorganisms, such as active microswimmers, exhibit an effective diffusive behavior at long times. Combining the two ingredients above, a natural question then emerges on how the effective diffusion of active microswimmers is altered in shear flows -- a widespread situation in natural environments with practical implications, \textit{e.g.} regarding biofilm formation. In this Letter, we investigate the motility and dispersion of \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} microalgae, within a rectangular microfluidic channel subjected to a sinusoidal Poiseuille flow. Using high-resolution optical microscopy and a particle-tracking algorithm, we reconstruct individual trajectories in various flow conditions and statistically analyze them through moment theory and sliding windowed demodulation. We find that the velocity fluctuations and the dispersion coefficient increase as the flow amplitude is increased, with only weak dependencies on the flow periodicity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the generalization of Taylor-Aris law to active particles is valid.</p>

            <p>Exciton mobility in two-dimensional semiconductors is a key ingredient in materials-based design of optoelectronic functionalities. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) set a good test case, with tightly bound excitons and designable flexibility that offer an ideal platform for realizing strain effects on exciton energy transfer. Here, we present an ab initio study to construct strain-induced exciton energy profiles and model exciton dynamics on top of these potential surfaces. We focus on inhomogeneously-strained monolayer WS$_2$, combining excitonic band structures derived from many-body perturbation theory for a large variety of strain profiles and calculate the change in mobility characteristics using a semiclassical ballistic transport model. We connect a wealth of strain patterns to exciton drift, diffusion, and confinement. Our results point to strain-induced regimes of super-ballistic propagation and an anomalous effective diffusion, governed entirely by the strain landscape. Our results provide structure-specific understanding of ballistic strain-tunable exciton behavior, offering design principles for engineering exciton dynamics in two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <h2>Local Potential Functional Embedding Theory of Molecular Systems: Localized Orbital-Based Embedding from an Exact Density-Functional Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. Makhlouf, B. Senjean, E. Fromager</p>
            <p>Localized orbital-based quantum embedding, as originally formulated in the context of density matrix embedding theory (DMET), is revisited from the perspective of lattice density functional theory (DFT). An in-principle exact (in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory, where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density, is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS) lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of such an ansatz to improve substantially the description of density profiles (localized orbitals occupation numbers in this context) in strongly correlated systems.</p>

The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.</p>

            <p>We investigate the localization of electronic states in the integer quantum Hall effect using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By studying a continuum SchrÃ¶dinger model with disordered electrostatic potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effect of polydispersity on fluctuation-induced interactions between colloids trapped at a fluid interface. Using the scattering-matrix formalism, we calculate the interaction energy in two- and three-body systems under three mechanical boundary conditions. We find that size asymmetry can either suppress or enhance the many-body interaction compared to a monodisperse system, with the outcome depending on colloids mobility and separation. For fixed colloids, the interaction is suppressed at short separations but enhanced at large separations. In contrast, for mobile colloids, the interaction is predominantly enhanced at large distances but exhibits a competitive behavior in the near-field. This culminates in a large, multi-order-of-magnitude amplified sensitivity {to size asymmetry} for bobbing and tilting colloids at long range, highlighting a complex interplay between geometry and colloids mobility with significant implications for self-assembly.</p>

We develop a linear response theory that treats all types of noise on the same footing and generalizes a concept of transport coefficients for charge and heat currents, as well as relations between them, to equilibrium noise power. Within this theory, we find characteristic scaling of the noise coefficients with temperature in all regimes that can be relevant for experimental realizations of the SYK dots, find a set of universal constants, with their values being unique to the SYK physics, that connect these coefficients, and characterize noise manifestations of the Coulomb blockade. Beyond SYK systems, these results may serve as a general framework for identification of non-Fermi-liquid signatures in mesoscopic transport and provide additional observables for experiments on thermoelectric phenomena.</p>

The Fermi surface becomes coordinate dependent, it may be defined as the position of the singularity in momentum space of the Wigner transformed Green function. Then the topological invariant responsible for the stability of this Fermi surface is given by the same expression as for the homogeneous case, in which the Green function is replaced by its Wigner transformation while the ordinary products are replaced by the Moyal products. We illustrate the proposed construction by the examples of the systems, in which the given topological invariant is nontrivial and may be calculated explicitly.</p>

            <p>Using extensive Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigate how spatial confinement affects molecular organization within thin films of the nematic twist-bend ($\mathrm{N_{TB}}$) phase. Our simulations show that confinement markedly amplifies the otherwise elusive splay-bend order, primarily by suppressing the intrinsic three-dimensional heliconical structure characteristic of bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$. Remarkably, when the $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase is confined between parallel walls imposing planar anchoring, and the bulk wave vector is oriented parallel to the walls, a smectic splay-bend ($\mathrm{S_{SB}}$) phase spontaneously emerges near the confining surfaces. This intermediate structure subsequently transforms into the bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase either directly via a smectic splay-bend-twist ($\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$) phase or through a sequence involving both the $\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$ and the nematic splay-bend-twist ($\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$) phases. Notably, the $\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$ phase becomes particularly pronounced as the molecular bend angle approaches its maximum attainable value in bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$; this regime occurs in close proximity to the $\mathrm{N}\text{--}\mathrm{S_{A}}\text{--}\mathrm{S_{SB}}$ triple point on the bulk phase diagram. Our findings reveal a compelling and intricate interplay among chirality, confinement, and molecular ordering, further evidenced by the calculated elementary director distortions. Crucially, this study opens promising avenues for experimental exploration: confined thin-film geometries serve as powerful model systems for revealing and characterizing novel nematic and smectic liquid-crystal phases that remain elusive in, or currently inaccessible to, bulk experiments.</p>

            <p>Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy-efficient and climate-friendly alternative to traditional vapor-compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials were minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit-cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3/Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. Our approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.</p>

            <p>The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.</p>

We analytically determine the degree and percolation properties of such networks with exactly two types of link probability, demonstrating that whether the networks are structured such that the nodes are not statistically indistinguishable has profound effects on these measures, both quantitively and in how such networks need to be approached. In particular, we develop a technique for solving the percolation problem which can be applied to both structured and unstructured networks. The method entails writing self-consistent integral and differential equations for the probability that each node will belong to the network's giant component. Exact solutions to these equations are obtained and simulations which confirm our analytic predictions are presented.</p>

Such phenomena can occur in various interacting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on previous observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as an exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \(N_c\), becomes infinite. We identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated with the conformal manifolds. By considering \(N_c\) as finite but large, we show that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that results in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG) flow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed points into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an emergent \(SO(\mathcal{N})\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \(N_c \rightarrow \infty\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction of the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement entropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum fluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where interaction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space. Our studies provide an effective framework for addressing topological quantum critical points with high-dimensional interaction parameter spaces, potentially housing many fixed points of various stabilities. They also highlight the central role of entangled conformal operators and their entropy in shaping universality classes of surface topological quantum phase transitions. We conclude with open questions and possible future directions.</p>

            <h2>Variational Gaussian Approximation in Replica Analysis of Parametric Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takashi Takahashi</p>
            <p>We revisit the replica method for analyzing inference and learning in parametric models, considering situations where the data-generating distribution is unknown or analytically intractable. Instead of assuming idealized distributions to carry out quenched averages analytically, we use a variational Gaussian approximation for the replicated system in grand canonical formalism in which the data average can be deferred and replaced by empirical averages, leading to stationarity conditions that adaptively determine the parameters of the trial Hamiltonian for each dataset. This approach clarifies how fluctuations affect information extraction and connects directly with the results of mathematical statistics or learning theory such as information criteria. As a concrete application, we analyze linear regression and derive learning curves. This includes cases with real-world datasets, where exact replica calculations are not feasible.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, representative datasets designed to capture the full spectrum of data quality encountered in practice, with both high- and low-quality data for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features of the device state. Collating such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability, slow measurement bandwidths, and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to simulate charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With an extensive set of parameters that can be varied and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.</p>

            <p>Acetic acid, an important industrial chemical, is a key target product for CO2 reduction due to its dual role in carbon utilization and chemical feedstock supply. Although photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCCR) can generate acetic acid alongside other multicarbon products, its yield is typically low, limited by competing reactions and inefficient C-C coupling. Herein, we report a chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4 (CMZI) photocatalyst that achieves a remarkable acetic acid yield of 962 {umol g-1 h-1 with a high selectivity of 97.3 %. This yield is ten times higher than the current highest reported value, while attaining state-of-the-art selectivity10. The remarkable productivity arises from synergistic effect between chiral structure and sulfur (S) sites of CMZI. Chirality-induced spin polarization in CMZI stabilizes the key triplet OCCO intermediate, significantly promoting C-C coupling efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S sites on {102} crystal facets of ZnIn2S4 exhibit thermodynamic and kinetic preferences for acetic acid formation. This work offers critical insights into catalytic strategies for CO2 reduction toward the efficient and scalable synthesis of various multicarbon products.</p>

            <p>Despite extensive experimental and theoretical work over several decades, Schmid-Bulgadaev quantum phase transition remains a subject of debate. Here we revisit this problem by performing systematic experiments on low-frequency current-voltage characteristics of Josephson junctions over a wide range of parameters. The experiments are conducted in a true resistive environment formed by a metallic on-chip resistor located near the junction. Over the parameter range of the experiment, we find that the transition occurs when the resistance crosses the quantum value $h/(4e^2)\simeq 6.5$ k$\Omega$ for Cooper pairs, as originally predicted. The temperature $T$ of the experiment is naturally non-zero, but our basic theoretical modeling corroborates that the observations under these conditions can serve as the basis for the conclusions made, in particular, the crossover resistance from superconducting to insulating regime is the same as that at $T=0$.</p>

The Raman spectra indicate the decisive role of surface defects, presumably oxygen vacancies, for all studied x = 1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 and significant degree "y" of oxygen deficiency. At the same time elemental analysis did not reveal any noticeable concentration of magnetic impurities in theHf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders, and the X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the dominant presence (from 87 to 96 wt. %) of the orthorhombic phase. Therefore, the superparamagnetic response of the nanoparticles is explained by the appearance of magnetic state of oxygen vacancies accumulated near their surface. The Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, density functional theory calculations and dielectric measurements reveal that the studied ultra-small Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles may have ferroelectric-like properties and giant dielectric permittivity (> 10^3 - 10^5) in the frequency range 4 Hz - 10 kHz.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Aguilar, Miguel A. MuÃ±oz, Sandro Azaele</p>
            <p>Robust inference for stochastic dynamical systems is often hampered by sparse sampling and the absence of closed-form likelihoods. We introduce a Monte Carlo path-inference framework that leverages full-path statistics and bridge processes to deliver reliable parameter estimation and model selection from coarsely sampled time series, without requiring analytical solutions. Crucially, we couple mechanistic stochastic models with their inference procedures to quantify how experimental design -specifically, sampling frequency and dataset size- governs estimator precision and model distinguishability. This analysis reveals optimal sampling regimes and sharp, resolution-dependent limits beyond which competing models become empirically indistinguishable. We validate the approach across four disparate systems -trajectories of optically trapped particles, human microbiome dynamics, social-media topic mentions, and forest population time series- recovering parameters and identifying when inference is fundamentally constrained by measurement resolution, thereby clarifying ongoing debates about dominant noise sources in these systems. Together, these results establish path-based Monte Carlo as a practical, general tool for inference and model discrimination in complex systems and provide principled guidelines for designing measurements that maximize information under real-world constraints.</p>

            <p>Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.</p>

            <p>Room-temperature superconductor has been a century-long dream of humankind. Recent research on hydrogen-based superconductors (e.g., CaH6, LaH10, etc.) at high-pressure conditions lifts the record of superconducting critical temperature (Tc) up to ~250 kelvin. We here report the experimental synthesis of the first-ever room-temperature superconductor by compression on a mixture of La-Sc alloy and ammonia borane at pressures of 250-260 gigapascals (GPa) via a diamond anvil cell by a laser-heating technique. Superconductivity with an onset temperature of 271-298 kelvin at 195-266 GPa is observed by the measurement of zero electrical resistance and the suppression of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data unambiguously reveal that this superconductor crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with a stoichiometry LaSc2H24, in excellent agreement with our previous prediction1. Through thirteen reproducible experimental runs, we provide solid evidence of the realization of a room-temperature superconductor for the first time, marking a milestone in the field of superconductivity.</p>

The measured high-resolution Raman scattering (RS) spectra are composed of the 10 Raman-active modes: 5A$_\textrm{g}$ and 5E$_\textrm{g}$, predicted by calculation using the density functional theory and identified using polarization-resolved RS measurements. We also studied the effect of temperature on the RS spectra of CGT from 5~K to 300~K. A strong magneto-phonon coupling in CGT is revealed at temperatures of about 150~K and 60~K, which are associated with the appearance of the local magnetic order in the material and the transition to the complete ferromagnetic phase, respectively. Moreover, a unique shape of the A$_g^5$ mode composed of a set of very narrow Raman peaks is simulated using a model that takes into account vibrations of Ge-Ge pseudo-molecules for various Ge isotopes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivani Bhardwaj, Sudhir K. Pandey</p>
            <p>Hund's metallicity in 3$d$ transition metal oxides constitutes a rare class of compounds, since they have been long understood considering the dominance of Hubbard $U$. $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$\& $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ belong to this rare class of metals; among them, $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$ has been the subject of extensive investigations for its unconventional heavy-fermion behavior, while studies on $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ remain limited despite its anomalous ferromagnetic ground state. In this study, we report an unusual spin-orbital selective localization in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ leading to a sharp Kondo resonance at $\sim$70 K in the spin-$up$ channel of orbitals of $t_{2g}$ symmetry using a combination of Density functional theory and Dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Correspondingly, an appreciable reduction in the magnetization below $T$=100 K further suggests partial Kondo screening of local moments active at low temperatures, explaining its effective spin magnetization state and upturn in its resistivity observed in experimental reports. We note a significant effect of Hund's induced spin-orbital selective incoherence in dictating the temperature evolution of its macroscopic observables e.g. spin-spin correlation function and effective local moment. Our results reveal a potentially distinct/new form of spin-dependent selectivity induced via Hund's coupling in addition to the conventional orbital-selectivity in the Hund's metals, as a plausible key mechanism in stabilizing their long-range magnetic order.</p>

            <p>Quasi-optical experiments are emerging as a powerful technique to probe magnetic transitions in molecular spin systems. However, the simultaneous presence of the electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions poses the challenge of discriminating between these two contributions. Besides, the identification of the spin-electric transitions can hardly rely on the peak intensity, because of the current uncertainties on the value of the spin-electric coupling in most molecular compounds. Here, we compute the polarizations required for electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions through spin-Hamiltonian models of molecular spin triangles. We show that the polarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of transitions. In addition, it allows one to identify the physical origin of the zero-field splitting in the ground multiplet, a debated issue with significant implications on the coherence properties of the spin qubit implemented in molecular spin triangles.</p>

            <p>This paper extends the results regarding entropic convergence and the strong linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation (without external force) in [C. David Levermore. Entropic convergence and the linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation. Communications in Partial Differential Equations, 18(7-8):1231--1248, 1993] to the case of the Boltzmann equation with external force. Our starting point is the Boltzmann equation with an external force introduced in [Diogo ArsÃ©nio and Laure Saint-Raymond. From the Vlasov--Maxwell--Boltzmann System to Incompressible Viscous Electro-magneto-hydrodynamics, EMS Press, 2019], we then find new conditions on the force and rigorously prove the maintaining result by Levermore. More specifically, any sequence of DiPerna-Lions renormalized solutions of the Boltzmann equation with external force are shown to have fluctuations (about the global Maxwellian equilibrium $M$) that converge entropically (and hence strongly in $L^1$) to the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation for any positive time, given that its initial fluctuations about $M$ converge entropically to the provided $L^2$ initial data of the linearized equation, where the force can be physically significant.</p>

            <p>We consider the relationship between thermodynamics, fitness, and Darwinian selection in autocatalytic molecular replicators. We uncover a thermodynamic bound that relates fitness, replication rate, and thermodynamic affinity of replication. This bound applies to a broad range of systems, including elementary and non-elementary autocatalytic reactions, polymer-based replicators, and certain kinds of autocatalytic sets. In addition, we show that the critical selection coefficient (the minimal fitness difference visible to selection) is bounded by a simple function of the affinity. Our results imply fundamental thermodynamic bounds on selection strength in molecular evolution, complementary to other bounds that arise from finite population sizes and error thresholds. These bounds may be relevant for understanding thermodynamic constraints faced by early replicators at the origin of life. We illustrate our approach on several examples, including a classic model of replicators in a chemostat.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nilotpal Chakraborty, Roderich Moessner, Benoit Doucot</p>
            <p>A crucial ingredient for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing is the construction of logical qubits with low error rates and intrinsic noise protection. We propose a cross-platform construction for such hardware-level noise-protection in which the qubits are protected from depolarizing (relaxation) and dephasing errors induced by local noise. These logical qubits arise from the entanglement between two internal degrees of freedom, hence - entanglemons. Our construction is based on the emergence of collective degrees of freedom from a generalized coherent state construction, similar in spirit to spin coherent states, of a set of such internally entangled units. These degrees of freedom, for a finite number of units, parametrize the quantized version of complex projective space $\mathbb{C}$P(3). The noise protection of the entanglemon qubit is then a consequence of a weakly coupled emergent degree of freedom arising due to the non-linear geometry of complex projective space. We present two simple models for entanglemons which are platform agnostic, provide varying levels of protection and in which the qubit basis states are the two lowest energy states with a higher energy gap to other states. We end by commenting on how entanglemons could be realized in platforms ranging from superconducting circuits and trapped ion platforms to possibly also quantum Hall skyrmions in graphene and quantum dots in semiconductors. The inherent noise protection in our models combined with the platform agnosticism highlights the potential of encoding information in additional weakly coupled emergent degrees of freedom arising in non-linear geometrical spaces and curved phase spaces, thereby proposing a different route to achieve scalable fault-tolerance.</p>

The Kerr rotation and ellipticity are analyzed, with an unusual observation of a giant rotation angle deprived of discontinuity.

We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints.

            <p>Strong light-matter interactions can create non-equilibrium materials with on-demand novel functionalities. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet theorem provides the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these laser-dressed systems. However, signatures of the Floquet states are needed, as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics, can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy based on the Floquet formalism to finally capture the full frequency-dependence in the optical response properties of realistic laser-dressed crystals, and use it investigate the Floquet engineering in a first-principle model for ZnO of full dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, laser-controllable, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</p>

            <p>Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot based encodings. Moreover, we show the first experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.</p>

            <p>Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</p>

            <h2>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Lunt, Thomas Kriecherbauer, Kenneth T-R McLaughlin, Curt von Keyserlingk</p>
            <p>The high complexity of many-body quantum dynamics means that essentially all approaches either exploit special structure or are approximate in nature. One such approach--the memory function formalism--involves a carefully chosen split into fast and slow modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. Using a formulation in operator Krylov space known as the recursion method, we prove the emergence of a universal random matrix description of the fast mode dynamics. This is captured by the level-$n$ Green's function $G_n (z)$, which we show approaches universal scaling forms in the fast limit $n\to\infty$. Notably, this emergent universality can occur in both chaotic and non-chaotic systems, provided their spectral functions are smooth. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT), even though there is no explicit randomness present in the Hamiltonian. At finite $z$ we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, while if $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application of this universality, we give a numerical method--the spectral bootstrap--for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof involves a map to a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, rigorously controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. We are led via steepest-descent to a Coulomb gas optimization problem, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the `Operator Growth Hypothesis--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. These results elevate the recursion method to a theoretically principled framework with universal content.</p>

            <h2>Phases of Floquet code under local decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Tang, Yimu Bao</p>
            <p>Floquet code is a dynamical quantum memory with a periodically evolving logical space. As a defining feature, the code exhibits an anyon automorphism after each period, giving rise to a non-trivial evolution of each logical state. In this paper, we study the Floquet code under local decoherence and perfect measurements and demonstrate that below the decoherence threshold, the code is in a robust phase characterized by the anyon automorphism. We first derive the 3D statistical mechanics model for the maximum likelihood decoder of the 2D Floquet code under local Pauli decoherence. We identify a class of two-qubit Pauli channels under which the 3D statistical mechanics model becomes decoupled 2D models and obtain the threshold for such decoherence channels. We then propose a diagnostic of the anyon automorphism in the presence of local decoherence. We analytically show that this diagnostic distinguishes the Floquet code from the toric code under repeated syndrome measurements and undergoes a phase transition at the threshold.</p>

            <h2>Long-Range Interacting Particles on a Helix: A Statistical and Correlation Analysis of Equilibrium Configurations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J.M. DÃ¶rre, F.K. Diakonos, P. Schmelcher</p>
            <p>We provide a statistical and correlational analysis of the spatial and energetic properties of equilibrium configurations of a few-body system of two to eight equally charged classical particles that are confined on a one-dimensional helical manifold. The two-body system has been demonstrated to yield an oscillatory effective potential, thus providing stable equilibrium configurations despite the repulsive Coulomb interactions. As the system size grows, the number of equilibria increases, approximately following a power-law. This can be attributed to the increasing complexity in the highly non-linear oscillatory behavior of the potential energy surface. This property is reflected in a crossover from a spatially regular distribution of equilibria for the two-body system to a heightened degree of disorder upon the addition of particles. However, in accordance with the repulsion within a helical winding, the observed interparticle distances in equilibrium configurations cluster around values of odd multiples of half a helical winding, thus maintaining an underlying regularity. Furthermore, an energetic hierarchy exists based on the spatial location of the local equilibria, which is subject to increasing fluctuations as the system size grows.</p>

            <h2>Piezoelectric truss metamaterials: data-driven design and additive manufacturing</h2>

            <p>In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is highly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity is the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability of materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent directionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their crystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural piezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to leverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an integrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials with customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of truss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the topology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity. Then, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic piezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of photo-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework discovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic, unidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive manufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating these metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over 48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized metamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved metamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than its longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk materials. Our approach enables customizable piezoelectric responses and paves the way towards the development of a new generation of electro-active animate materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Yu Xiao, Bowen Kan, Huan Ma, Bowen Zhao, Honghui Shang</p>
            <p>We introduce an efficient approach to implement neural network quantum states (NNQS) as trial wavefunctions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ansÃ¤tze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recently it has been shown (Xiao et al, arXiv2505.18519) that a broad class of highly correlated wave-functions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we apply this approach and present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries. Our results demonstrate that AFQMC with an NNQS trial wavefunction can attain near-exact total energies, highlighting the potential of AFQMC with NNQS to overcome longstanding challenges in strongly correlated electronic structure calculations. We also outline future research directions for improving this promising methodology.</p>

            <p>We study the interactions mediated by symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), their renormalizations, and applicability of the anharmonic oscillator model for a coupled phase qubit. The coupling SQUID can switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings, interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chanaprom Cholsuk, Sujin Suwanna, Tobias Vogl</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at this https URL, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer-Shannon Renyi Equivalence: Exact Results for Quantum Critical Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. A. Rajabpour</p>
            <p>Shannon-Renyi and stabilizer entropies are key diagnostics of structure, non-stabilizerness, phase transitions, and universality in quantum many-body states. We establish an exact correspondence for quadratic fermions: for any nondegenerate Gaussian eigenstate, the stabilizer Renyi entropy equals the Shannon-Renyi entropy of a number-conserving free-fermion eigenstate on a doubled system, evaluated in the computational basis. Specializing to the transverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies maps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length $2L$. Building on this correspondence, together with other exact identities we prove, closed expressions for the stabilizer entropy at indices $\alpha=\frac{1}{2},2,4$ for a broad class of critical closed free-fermion systems were derived. Each of these can be written with respect to the universal functions of the TFI chain. We further obtain conformal-field-theory scaling laws for the stabilizer entropy under both periodic and open boundaries at arbitrary Renyi index for these critical systems.</p>

We have provided a detailed analysis of the infrared spectrum data and a comparison of the absorption spectrum of the same sample. It turned out that the recorded spectra are not only different from ordinary absorption spectra but also carry substantial information about the temperature dependence of the population of vibrationally excited states. We conclude by proposing a hypothesis on the thermal excitation mechanism of vibrational energy levels of molecules consistent with the distinct characteristics of the obtained infrared emission spectra.</p>

            <p>Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.</p>

            <p>The Mpemba effect is the phenomenon whereby systems farther from equilibrium may relax faster. In this work, we show that this counterintuitive behavior appears in the very measures that define quantum complexity. Using the framework of quantum resource theories, we study the dynamics of coherence, imaginarity, non-Gaussianity, and magic state resources in random circuit models. Our results reveal that coherence and imaginarity display a quantum Mpemba effect when the system is initialized in resourceful product states, while non-Gaussianity and magic do not. Strikingly, all four resources exhibit the so-called Pontus-Mpemba effect: an initial "preheating" stage accelerates relaxation compared to direct "cooling" dynamics. Taken together, our findings show that Mpemba physics extends beyond thermodynamics and asymmetry, emerging broadly in the resource theories that capture aspects of quantum complexity.</p>

            <p>We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher information matrices from RÃ©nyi relative entropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the RÃ©nyi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric RÃ©nyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the RÃ©nyi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean RÃ©nyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric RÃ©nyi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the RÃ©nyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ RÃ©nyi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states and time-evolved states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.</p>

The molonayer graphene was supposed to be exposed under the influence of the external gate-potential and the local Coulomb interaction effects have been taken into account at each lattice site position in the monolayer. A sufficiently large temperature domain was found, where the superconducting order parameter is not vanishing. Corresponding to this, at the surprisingly high temperature limit, we obtain a narrow domain of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda_{\rm eff}$, emphasizing the superconducting state. We discuss the localizing role of Hubbard-$U$ interaction and the effects external gate potential on the calculated physical parameters in the system. We explain the importance of the chemical potential in the formation of the superconducting state. We show the existence of a large superconducting band-gap in the system even in the case of the absence of the applied electric field potential.</p>

            <p>The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. R. Moura, L. V. Santos</p>
            <p>The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We study the finite-temperature vestigial superconducting phases of a two-dimensional system of fluctuating spin-triplet pairing and spin magnetism. Denoting the respective primary order parameters by $\mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{N}$, which are not long-range ordered at finite temperature, the composite fields $\phi_{dd} = \mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{d}$ and $\phi_{dN} = \mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{N}$ are spin-rotation invariant and can condense at finite temperature. Using a large-$N$ approach that respects the Mermin-Wagner theorem, we here derive the phase diagram which features two vestigial superconductors: $(A)$ a charge-$4e$ superconductor with $\phi_{dd}\neq 0$ and $\phi_{dN} =0$ and $(B)$ a charge-$2e$ state with $\phi_{dN} ,\phi_{dd}\neq 0$. We analyze the temperature and coupling-constant dependent properties of these two superconductors using a perturbative approach and a variational Hartree-Fock study. This reveals non-trivial spectra in the superconductors, which result from the fundamental building blocks being distinct from the usual Cooper pairs--in phase $(A)$, the elementary bosons are bound states of four electrons and, in phase $(B)$, of three electrons and a hole. This work complements the previous study [Nat. Commun. 15, 1713 (2024), arXiv:2301.01344], which focused on the properties of phase $(B)$.</p>

            <p>Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.</p>

            <p>Hund's metallicity in 3$d$ transition metal oxides constitutes a rare class of compounds, since they have been long understood considering the dominance of Hubbard $U$. $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$\& $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ belong to this rare class of metals; among them, $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$ has been the subject of extensive investigations for its unconventional heavy-fermion behavior, while studies on $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ remain limited despite its anomalous ferromagnetic ground state. In this study, we report an unusual spin-orbital selective localization in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ leading to a sharp Kondo resonance at $\sim$70 K in the spin-$up$ channel of orbitals of $t_{2g}$ symmetry using a combination of Density functional theory and Dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Correspondingly, an appreciable reduction in the magnetization below $T$=100 K further suggests partial Kondo screening of local moments active at low temperatures, explaining its effective spin magnetization state and upturn in its resistivity observed in experimental reports. We note a significant effect of Hund's induced spin-orbital selective incoherence in dictating the temperature evolution of its macroscopic observables e.g. spin-spin correlation function and effective local moment. Our results reveal a potentially distinct/new form of spin-dependent selectivity induced via Hund's coupling in addition to the conventional orbital-selectivity in the Hund's metals, as a plausible key mechanism in stabilizing their long-range magnetic order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longjun Xiang, Jinxiong Jia, Fuming Xu, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>The nonlinear charge current $j_a=\sigma_{abc}E_bE_c$ of Bloch electrons in quantum materials under an electric field can be well characterized by the quantum geometry, as most exemplified by the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall effects induced by the Berry curvature dipole and the quantum metric dipole, respectively. Nevertheless, a unified quantum geometric description for the bilinear charge current $j_a=\sigma_{ab,c}E_bB_c$ of Bloch electrons driven by the electromagnetic fields, including the ordinary Hall effect (OHE), the magnetononlinear Hall effect (MNHE), and the planar Hall effect (PHE), remains elusive. Herein, we show that this bilinear conductivity, as contributed by the orbital minimal coupling and the spin Zeeman coupling of the applied magnetic field, respectively, can be classified by the conventional quantum geometry and the recently proposed Zeeman quantum geometry, where the symmetry constraint from the fundamental response equation is encoded. Specifically, we uncover that the intrinsic orbital and spin bilinear currents--responsible for the orbital and spin MNHEs--are governed by the quantum metric quadrupole and the Zeeman quantum metric dipole, respectively. In contrast, the extrinsic orbital and spin bilinear currents, which are linear in the relaxation time $\tau$ and lead to the orbital and spin PHEs, are governed by the Berry curvature quadrupole and the Zeeman Berry curvature dipole, respectively. Counterintuitively, we find that the OHE due to the Lorentz force can also include an interband contribution from the quantum metric quadrupole. After building the quantum geometric classification of this bilinear current, we study the rarely known spin PHE with the surface Dirac cone of three-dimensional topological insulators.</p>

            <h2>Spectroscopic evidence of Kondo resonance in 3$d$ van der Waals ferromagnets</h2>

            <p>Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets drive the advancement in spintronic applications and enable the exploration of exotic magnetism in low-dimensional systems. The entanglement of dual $-$ localized and itinerant $-$ nature of electrons lies at the heart of the correlated electron systems giving rise to exotic ground state properties such as complex magnetism, heavy fermionic behavior, Kondo lattice formation, \textit{etc}. Through temperature-dependent electronic structure of vdW ferromagnets, (Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$, probed using high-resolution photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), we provide direct evidence of the emergence of Kondo resonance peak driven by complex interplay between localized and itinerant electrons. In overall agreement with experimental electronic structure and magnetic properties, DFT+DMFT also reveals finite spin band splitting well beyond $T_{C}$. Core levels, valence band photoemission spectra together with DFT+DMFT spectral functions reveal insignificant change across $T_{C}$ indicating non-Stoner magnetism in (Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$. Our results provide a way forward to the understanding of complex interplay between electronic structure, exotic magnetism and heavy fermionic behavior leading to Kondo scenerio in 3$d$ vdW ferromagnets.</p>

            <p>We experimentally investigate magnetocaloric effect for single crystals of MnTe altermagnet at the transition to the state with spontaneous spin polarization, i.e. well below the NÃ©el temperature of MnTe. The isothermal magnetic entropy change $\Delta S$ is calculated from the experimental magnetization curves by using Maxwell relation. We observe well-defined magnetocaloric effect as a narrow $\Delta S$ peak around the cricital temperature $T_c\approx 81$~K, which is accompanied by sharp magnetization jump. This behavior is unusual for standard ferromagnetic transitions, so it confirms the predicted spin-orbit-induced spin polarization in the MnTe altermagnetic state.</p>

The flux-to-voltage transfer function demonstrates sharp, symmetric, and highly linear behavior at temperatures up to 5 K. Bi-SQUIDs featuring our single-element S-N-S design represent an interesting and original approach to this field, as they demonstrate a numerically estimated spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) linearity exceeding 60 dB, achieved in a single element, simplifying the requirements in terms of arrays containing hundreds of junctions. These results highlight the potential of proximity-based Bi-SQUIDs for compact, low-noise, and highly linear cryogenic amplifiers in quantum sensing, magnetometry, and biomedical diagnostics.</p>

            <p>Exploring the electron tunneling mechanisms in diverse materials systems constitutes a versatile strategy for tailoring the properties of optoelectronic devices. In this domain, bipolar vertical tunneling junctions composed of van der Waals materials with vastly different electronic band structures enable simultaneous injection of electrons and holes into an optically active material, providing a universal blueprint for light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Efficient modulation of the injection efficiency has previously been demonstrated by creating resonant states within the energy barrier formed by the luminescent material. Here, we present an alternative approach towards resonant tunneling conditions by fabricating tunneling junctions composed entirely from gapped materials: Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ as electrodes, hBN as a tunneling barrier, and monolayer WSe$_2$ as a luminescent medium. The characterization of such LEDs revealed a nonmonotonous evolution of the electroluminescence intensity with the tunneling bias. The dominant role driving the characteristics of the electron tunneling was associated with the relative alignment of the density of states in Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ electrodes. The unique device architecture introduced here presents a universal pathway towards LEDs operating at room temperature with electrically modulated emission intensity.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Quantum Entanglement Between Photon and Phonon Modes in a Coulomb-coupled Optomechanical Cavity Magnonic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhib Ullah, Muhammad Idrees, Said Mikki</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum information science and a crucial resource for quantum technologies such as precision sensing, secure communication, and computation. In hybrid cavity magno-optomechanical systems, entanglement among cavity photons, magnons, and phonons enables manipulation of quantum states across different modes via radiation pressure-based light-matter interaction. We propose a hybrid optomechanical cavity-magnonic setup with Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere allowing magnons to couple with photons via magnetic-dipole interaction. The system also uses optomechanical and electrostatic interactions to entangle cavity photons and mechanical resonators. We focus on how the magnon nonlinear Kerr effect and varying coupling strengths influence entanglement dynamics. By analysing nonlinear effects alongside other coupling parameters, we identify optimal conditions for initiating and sustaining robust entanglement between the motional modes (phonons) of two Coulomb-coupled mechanical resonators. Our model predicts that adding Coulomb interaction and magnon coupling enhances the degree and tunability of entanglement, making it more resilient to thermal baths at 3 K. This study addresses how to optimize and sustain phonon-phonon entanglement in complex hybrid quantum systems. These findings offer insights relevant to developing quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information processing and other quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Enabling coherent light-matter interactions is a critical step toward next-generation quantum technologies. However, achieving this under ambient temperature conditions remains challenging due to rapid dephasing in optically excited systems. Optical metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum have recently emerged as a powerful platform for reaching the strong light-matter coupling regime in flat, subwavelength thickness devices. Here, we investigate ultrafast exciton-polariton dynamics in self-hybridized WS$_2$ thin-film metasurfaces. Using hyperspectral momentum-resolved imaging, we reconstruct the highly anisotropic exciton-polariton dispersion, with a transition from positive to negative effective mass along orthogonal symmetry axes. Femtosecond pump-probe and multidimensional spectroscopy reveal detuning-dependent polariton dynamics with a coherence time up to ~110 fs, and allow direct observation of the coherent dynamics through ultrafast Rabi oscillations with ~45 fs period. We describe this behaviour with a three-eigenstate model that couples the photonic resonance with both bright and dark excitons, extending the conventional two-state picture of strong coupling. Our results establish van der Waals metasurfaces as a promising platform for next-generation polaritonic devices, enabling coherent quantum transfer of matter excitations at room temperature.</p>

            <p>Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and prominent mode confinement. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state.

            <h2>Tuning Thermal Conductivity and Electron-Phonon Interactions in Carbon and Boron Nitride MoirÃ© Diamanes via Twist Angle Manipulation</h2>

            <p>We have investigated the effect of interlayer twist angle on lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) and band gap renormalization in boron nitride and carbon MoirÃ© diamanes. Moment tensor potentials were used for calculating energies and forces of interatomic interactions. The methods based on the solution of Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for phonons and the GreenKubo (GK) formula were utilized to calculate LTC. The 20-40 % difference in LTC values obtained with GK and BTE-based methods showed the importance of high-order anharmonic contributions to LTC. Significant reduction (by 4.5 - 9 times) of the in-plane LTC with the twist angle increase caused by the growth of structural disorder was observed in the MoirÃ© diamanes. This growth of disorder also leads to higher band gap renormalization (induced by classical nuclei motion) in the structures with higher twist angles. Significant band gap renormalization values obtained considering the quantum nuclear effects are caused by the high phonon frequencies related to the bonds with hydrogen atoms on the MoirÃ© diamanes surfaces. Understanding of the twist angle effect on LTC and electron-phonon coupling in the MoirÃ© diamanes provides a fundamental basis for manipulating their thermal and electronic properties, making these materials promising for thermoelectrics, microelectronics and optoelectronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Alper YoÄurt, Matthew T. Eiles</p>
            <p>One-dimensional Bose gases present an interesting setting to study the physics of Bose polarons, as density fluctuations play an enhanced role due to reduced dimensionality. Theoretical descriptions of this system have predominantly relied on contact pseudopotentials to model the impurity-bath interaction, leading to unphysical results in the strongly coupled limit. In this work, we analytically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, using a square well potential instead of a zero-range potential, for the ground-state wave function of a static impurity. We compute perturbative corrections arising from infinitesimally slow impurity motion. The polaron energy and effective mass remain finite in the strongly coupled regime, in contrast to the divergent behavior obtained using a contact potential. In this limit, we characterize the polaron properties in terms of the dimensionless ratio $\bar{w}\equiv w/\xi$ between the interaction range $w$ of the impurity-bath potential and the coherence length $\xi$ of the Bose gas. The effective mass exhibits a $1/\bar{w}$ scaling. The energy of the attractive polaron scales as $-1/\bar{w}^3$, whereas the repulsive polaron features subleading corrections to the dark soliton energy at the order $\bar{w}^3$.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7. Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60% higher than the initial value, then decays into a metastable state maintaining the enhancement. The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification of multi-electron correlations. In stark contrast to conventional asymmetric systems where SHG is typically suppressed upon photoexcitation, our experimental findings shed a new light on ultrafast optical control nonlinear properties in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Exponential quantum advantages for practical non-Hermitian eigenproblems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Ming Zhang, Yukun Zhang, Wenhao He, Xiao Yuan</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian physics has emerged as a rich field of study, with applications ranging from $PT$-symmetry breaking and skin effects to non-Hermitian topological phase transitions. Yet most studies remain restricted to small-scale or classically tractable systems. While quantum computing has shown strong performance in Hermitian eigenproblems, its extension to the non-Hermitian regime remains largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum algorithm to address general non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems, specifically targeting eigenvalues near a given line in the complex plane -- thereby generalizing previous results on ground state energy and spectral gap estimation for Hermitian matrices. Our method combines a fuzzy quantum eigenvalue detector with a divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently isolate relevant eigenvalues. This yields a provable exponential quantum speedup for non-Hermitian eigenproblems. Furthermore, we discuss the broad applications in detecting spontaneous $PT$-symmetry breaking, estimating Liouvillian gaps, and analyzing classical Markov processes. These results highlight the potential of quantum algorithms in tackling challenging problems across quantum physics and beyond.</p>

            <p>Room-temperature superconductor has been a century-long dream of humankind. Recent research on hydrogen-based superconductors (e.g., CaH6, LaH10, etc.) at high-pressure conditions lifts the record of superconducting critical temperature (Tc) up to ~250 kelvin. We here report the experimental synthesis of the first-ever room-temperature superconductor by compression on a mixture of La-Sc alloy and ammonia borane at pressures of 250-260 gigapascals (GPa) via a diamond anvil cell by a laser-heating technique. Superconductivity with an onset temperature of 271-298 kelvin at 195-266 GPa is observed by the measurement of zero electrical resistance and the suppression of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data unambiguously reveal that this superconductor crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with a stoichiometry LaSc2H24, in excellent agreement with our previous prediction1. Through thirteen reproducible experimental runs, we provide solid evidence of the realization of a room-temperature superconductor for the first time, marking a milestone in the field of superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junming Wu, Shihao Zhou, Benedetta Flebus, Wei Zhang</p>
            <p>Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo D'Alessio, Daniele Varsano, Elisa Molinari, Massimo Rontani</p>
            <p>Sliding ferroelectricity is a phenomenon that arises from the insurgence of spontaneous electronic polarization perpendicular to the layers of two-dimensional (2D) systems upon the relative sliding of the atomic layer constituents. Because of the weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between layers, sliding and the associated symmetry breaking can occur at low energy cost in materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenides. Here we discuss theoretically the origin and quantitative understanding of the phenomenon by focusing on a prototype structure, the WTe2 bilayer, where sliding ferroelectricity was first experimentally observed. We show that excitonic effects induce relevant energy band renormalizations in the ground state, and exciton condensation contributes significantly to stabilizing ferroelectricity upon sliding beyond previous predictions. Enhanced excitonic effects in 2D and vdW sliding are general phenomena that point to sliding ferroelectricity as relevant for a broad class of important materials, where the intrinsic electric dipole can couple with other quantum phenomena and, in turn, an external electric field can control the quantum phases through ferroelectricity in unexplored ways.</p>

            <p>The interplay between the fractional quantum Hall effect and nematicity is intriguing as it links emerging topological order and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Anisotropic fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) have indeed been reported in GaAs quantum wells but only in tilted magnetic fields, where the in-plane field explicitly breaks the rotational symmetry. Here we report the observation of FQHSs with highly anisotropic longitudinal resistances in purely perpendicular magnetic fields at even-denominator Landau level (LL) fillings {\nu} = 5/2 and 7/2 in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional hole systems. The coexistence of FQHSs and spontaneous symmetry breaking at half fillings signals the emergence of nematic FQHSs which also likely harbor non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations. By gate tuning the hole density, we observe a phase transition from an anisotropic, developing FQHS to an isotropic composite fermion Fermi sea at {\nu} = 7/2. Our calculations suggest that the mixed orbital components in the partially occupied LL play a key role in the competition and interplay between topological and nematic orders.</p>

            <p>We present a framework for treating anisotropic and non-additive impurity-bath interactions - features that are ubiquitous in realistic quantum impurity problems, but are often neglected in conventional approaches relying on additive, spherically symmetric pseudopotentials. To illustrate this, we focus on a Rydberg atom immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, where the internal-state degeneracy of the Rydberg impurity gives rise to configuration-dependent non-additive potentials. With increasing interaction strength, anisotropy-induced partial-wave mixing generates distinct polaron and molaron resonances, allowing for radially and angularly excited bound states to become accessible. This approach captures the anisotropy and non-additivity characteristic of a Rydberg impurity immersed in a quantum bath, and provides broad applicability to a host of quantum impurity problems beyond the FrÃ¶hlich paradigm.</p>

            <p>We present a new probe for the first-order transition for layered vortex matter: A second step in the screening of an ac field that is independent of the frequency and amplitude of the excitation. This second step is observed in the intermediate temperature and field ranges where detecting the jump in induction associated with the transition is rather elusive with standard magnetometry techniques. We observe this second step following a novel experimental protocol where the screening of a locally-generated ac field is remotely detected in another region of the sample. The coincidence of the typical temperature of the second step in direct and remote measurements strongly supports this feature is a probe of the first-order transition. This nonlocal effect detected at distances of thousands of vortex lattice spacings away indicates that a very efficient mechanism propagates the change in rigidity of the structure from the more (liquid) to the less (solid) symmetric vortex phases.</p>

            <h2>Obstruction-Driven Parity Inversion for Enhanced Optical Absorption in Hexagonal Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungil Baek, Jun Jung, Yong-Hyun Kim</p>
            <p>The optical selection rule states that opposite parity between the valence and conduction bands is required for optical absorption to occur. However, monolayer hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides (h-TMDs) such as $ \mathrm{MoS}_{2} $ exhibit pronounced optical absorption despite their nominally dipole-forbidden d-d transitions. In this Letter, we elucidate a parity inversion mechanism through which obstruction-driven band inversion promotes dipole-allowed optical transitions near the band edge in monolayer h-TMDs. By comparing trivial and obstructed atomic limit phases, we show that intersite interactions between hybridized d orbitals induce parity inversion. Our results provide a novel approach to tuning optical properties through parity control, bridging the gap between topology and light-matter interaction.</p>

            <h2>Quench Dynamics and Stability of Dark Solitons in Exciton Polariton Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chunyu Jia, Zhaoxin Liang</p>
            <p>Exciton polariton condensates (EPCs) have emerged as a paradigmatic platform for investigating nonequilibrium quantum many-body phenomena, particularly due to their intrinsic open-dissipative nature and strong nonlinear interactions governed by the interplay between stimulated scattering and reservoir-mediated damping. Recent advances in Feshbach resonance engineering now enable precise tuning of interaction strengths, opening new avenues to explore exotic nonlinear excitations in these driven-dissipative systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the quench dynamics and stability of dark solitons in repulsive one-dimensional EPCs under sudden parameter variations in both nonlinear interaction strength g and pump intensity P. Through a Hamiltonian variational approach that incorporates reservoir damping effects, we derive reduced equations of motion for soliton velocity evolution that exhibit remarkable qualitative agreement with direct numerical simulations of the underlying open-dissipative Gross Pitaevskii equation. Our results reveal three distinct dynamical regimes: (i) stable soliton propagation at intermediate pump powers, (ii) velocity-dependent soliton breakup above critical pumping thresholds, and (iii) parametric excitation of soliton trains under simultaneous interaction quenches. These findings establish a quantitative framework for understanding soliton dynamics in nonresonantly pumped EPCs, with implications for quantum fluid dynamics and nonequilibrium Bose Einstein condensates.</p>

            <h2>Giant enhancement of terahertz high-harmonic generation by cavity engineering of Dirac semimetal</h2>

            <p>Engineered micro- or nano-structures based on nonlinear optical materials offer versatile opportunities for optoelectronic applications. While extensive efforts have been devoted to design tailored microcavities to promote and increase the optical nonlinearities of graphene, the potential of engineering its three-dimensional counterparts -- three-dimensional Dirac semimetals -- remains largely unexplored. Here we report on exceptionally strong terahertz nonlinearities in a cavity-engineered Dirac semimetal microstructure, and demonstrate a giant enhancement of terahertz third- and fifth-order harmonic yields by more than three orders of magnitude. By fabricating a designed structure of metallic metasurface microcavities on a nanometer thin film of the threedimensional Dirac semimetal Cd3As2, we significantly enhance the near-field intensity of a picosecond terahertz excitation pulse in resonance with the microcavity eigenmode. This transiently modifies the nonlinearities of the thin film and drives the nonlinear responses of the Dirac fermions from a weakly to a deeply nonperturbative regime where the observed high-harmonic generation essentially saturates.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7. Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60% higher than the initial value, then decays into a metastable state maintaining the enhancement. The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification of multi-electron correlations. In stark contrast to conventional asymmetric systems where SHG is typically suppressed upon photoexcitation, our experimental findings shed a new light on ultrafast optical control nonlinear properties in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>We develop an extension of the fermionic functional renormalization group for systems where strong correlations give rise to projected Hilbert spaces. We use our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by Luttinger's theorem.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Cheng Lo, Liao Jia Wang, Yu-Chang Chen</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate the electronic structures of pristine monolayer WSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ superlattices with periodic nitrogen substitution. Unlike random doping, which often introduces in-gap impurity states, periodic nitrogen doping primarily modulates the band gap, thereby facilitating effective band gap engineering for electronic and optoelectronic applications. The gap narrows monotonically with increasing dopant density (pristine $>$ 8-row $>$ 6-row $>$ 4-row), directly influencing device switching. We also evaluate the FET performance of nanojunctions created by these configurations by examining the contour plot of current density as a function of temperature and gate voltage, which quantifies how bandgap engineering affects switching characteristics. Our calculations clarify the classical-quantum crossover in sub-10 nm 2D FETs: as $T$ rises, $J$ approaches the thermionic current; as $T$ falls, quantum tunneling dominates, and the steep energy dependence of $\tau(E)$ may break the classical limit of subthreshold swing imposed by the Boltzmann tyranny. The optimal gating range ($V_g^\mathrm{ON}$, $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$) is investigated for each temperature, insensitive to temperature in the high-temperature regime, confirming the good thermal stability of the FET devices. A comparison study demonstrates that the 4-row structure, with large $J_\mathrm{OFF}$ and restricted operation range, is inappropriate for realistic FET applications. The pristine structure has a high $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$ ($\sim$1.1 V) makes it less practical, since such a large threshold voltage may promote time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) of the oxide layer, reducing device dependability. The 6-row and 8-row structures exhibit more favorable $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$ values ($\sim$0.75 V), achieving compromise, making them more promising candidates for future FET integration.</p>

            <p>Extended efforts have been devoted to the study of strongly-interacting excitons and their dynamics, towards macroscopic quantum states of matter such as Bose-Einstein condensates of excitons and polaritons. Momentum-direct layer-hybridized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted considerable attention due to their high oscillator strength and dipolar nature. However, the tunability of their interactions and dynamics remains unexplored. Here, we achieve an unprecedented control over the nonlinear properties of dipolar layer-hybridized excitons in an electrically gated van der Waals homobilayer monitored by transient optical spectroscopy. By applying a vertical electric field, we reveal strong Coulomb interactions of dipolar hybrid excitons, leading to opposite density-dependent energy shifts of the two main hybrid species based on their dipolar orientation, together with a strongly enhanced optical saturation of their absorption. Furthermore, by electrically tuning the interlayer tunneling between the hybridized carriers, we significantly extend the formation time of hybrid excitons, while simultaneously increasing their decay times. Our findings have implications for the search on quantum blockade and condensation of excitons and dipolaritons in two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>We study vortex-vortex and vortex-wave collisions in two-dimensional weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates, processes that play a central role in decaying quantum turbulence. Using numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we show that during collisions of vortex-antivortex dipoles, the kinetic energy is transferred from incompressible to compressible modes by two distinct mechanisms. Below the critical vortex separation for annihilation, the transfer is mediated by quantum energy released during annihilation events, while above the threshold it arises from vortex acceleration. In wave-vortex collisions, an incoming solitary wave splits into transient phase slips that interact with the vortex, one of the phase slips contributes to vortex annihilation, and the other phase slip acquires a stable core and forms a new vortex. By analyzing vortex trajectories and energy spectra, we provide new insights into energy transfer mechanisms in quantum turbulence and offer broader implications for topological interactions mediated by vortices.</p>

            <p>Laser fragmentation of suspended microparticles is an upcoming alternative to laser ablation in liquid (LAL) that allows to streamline the the delivery process and optimize the irradiation conditions for best efficiency. Yet, the structural basis of this process is not well understood to date. Herein we employed ultrafast x-ray scattering upon picosecond laser excitation of a gold microparticle suspension in order to understand the thermal kinetics as well as structure evolution after fragmentation. The experiments are complemented by simulations according to the two-temperature model to verify the spatiotemporal temperature distribution. It is found that above a fluence threshold of 750 J/m$^2$ the microparticles are fragmented within a nanosecond into several large pieces where the driving force is the strain due to a strongly inhomogenous heat distribution on the one hand and stress confinement due to the ultrafast heating compared to stress propagation on the other hand. The additional limited formation of small clusters is attributed to photothermal decomposition on the front side of the microparticles at the fluence of 2700 J/m$^2$.</p>

            <p>We apply two ab initio many-body methods based on Gutzwiller wave functions, i.e., correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) and Gutzwiller conjugate gradient minimization (GCGM), to the study of crystalline phases of atomic hydrogen. Both methods avoid empirical Hubbard U parameters and are free from double-counting issues. CMRT employs a Gutzwiller-type approximation that enables efficient calculations, while GCGM goes beyond this approximation to achieve higher accuracy at higher computational cost. By benchmarking against available quantum Monte Carlo results, we demonstrate that while both methods are more accurate than the widely used density-functional theory (DFT), GCGM systematically captures additional correlation energy missing in CMRT, leading to significantly improved total energy predictions. We also show that by including the correlation energy from LDA in the CMRT calculation, CMRT+ produces energy in better agreement with the QMC results in these hydrogen lattice systems.</p>

            <p>Correlated structures are intimately connected to intriguing phenomena exhibited by a variety of disordered systems such as soft colloidal gels, bio-polymer networks and colloidal suspensions near a shear jamming transition. The universal critical behavior of these systems near the onset of rigidity is often described by traditional approaches as the coherent potential approximation - a versatile version of effective-medium theory that nevertheless have hitherto lacked key ingredients to describe disorder spatial correlations. Here we propose a multi-purpose generalization of the coherent potential approximation to describe the mechanical behavior of elastic networks with spatially-correlated disorder. We apply our theory to a simple rigidity-percolation model for colloidal gels and study the effects of correlations in both the critical point and the overall scaling behavior. We find that although the presence of spatial correlations (mimicking attractive interactions of gels) shifts the critical packing fraction to lower values, suggesting sub-isostatic behavior, the critical coordination number of the associated network remains isostatic. More importantly, we discuss how our theory can be employed to describe a large variety of systems with spatially-correlated disorder.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Effects or Theoretical Artifacts? A Computational Reanalysis of Hydrogen at High-Pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Racioppi, Eva Zurek</p>
            <p>The stability of high-pressure phases of hydrogen remains a central question in condensed matter physics, where both experimental observations and theoretical predictions are highly sensitive to methodological choices. Here, we revisit the cold phase diagram of hydrogen between 400 and 700 GPa using the meta-GGA functionals (R2SCAN and SCAN0) and compare the results with the more common PBE. At the meta-GGA level, molecular phases (Cmca-4, Cmca-12, and C2/c) are stabilized over the atomic I41/amd phase up to significantly higher pressures than predicted by GGA, in closer agreement with diffusion Monte Carlo calculations and experimental observations of band-gap closure near 425 GPa. Furthermore, phonon spectra calculated with R2SCAN show that the dynamical instabilities and anharmonic signatures previously predicted at the GGA level vanish, indicating that such effects may partly arise from functional deficiencies rather than genuine nuclear quantum effects. Bonding analysis reveals that PBE artificially weakens intramolecular H-H bonds and enhances intermolecular interactions through charge delocalization, whereas meta-GGA preserves a more localized molecular character. Anharmonic motion remains relevant for finite-temperature dynamics; however, we demonstrate that the accurate description of the potential energy surface - particularly its curvature near equilibrium - is pivotal for assessing both phase stability and bonding of hydrogen at high-pressure.</p>

            <p>Topological defects provide a unifying language to describe how orientational order breaks down in active and living matter. Considering cells as elongated particles confluent, epithelial tissues can be interpreted as nematic fields and its defects have been linked to extrusion, migration, and morphogenetic transformations. Yet, epithelial cells are not restricted to nematic order: their irregular shapes can express higher rotational symmetries, giving rise to p-atic order. Here we introduce a framework to extract p-atic fields and their defects directly from experimental images. Applying this method to MDCK cells, we find that all symmetries generate this http URL strong positional or orientational correlations are found between nematic and hexatic defects, suggesting that different symmetries coexist largely independently. These results demonstrate that epithelial tissues should not be described by nematic order alone, but instead host a spectrum of p-atic symmetries. Our work provides the first direct experimental evidence for this multivalency of order and offers a route to test and refine emerging p-atic liquid crystal theories of living matter.</p>

            <p>Selectively exciting and manipulating phonons at nanoscale becomes more and more important but still remains challenging in modern nano-energy control and information sensing.

In particular, we demonstrate the nanoscale one-way axial phonon excitation and routing in chiral nanomaterials, by converting the photon spin in circularly polarized optical fields into the collective interference phonon spin. As exemplified in the smallest chiral carbon nanotube, we show that the rectification rate can reach nearly 100\%, achieving an ideal one-way phonon router, which is verified by molecular dynamics simulations.

Structural stability was first assessed through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory (DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in carbon nanodevices.</p>

            <p>The V2O3 phase diagram contains two insulating phases and one metallic phase with different lattice structures. The stability of these phases is very sensitive to pressure, offering a mechanism to tune phase transitions by inducing strain in thin films. The most studied source of strain is lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. In this work, however, we find that the film/substrate thermal expansion mismatch can be made to play a dominant role by modifying the substrate morphology. When grown on sapphire, the lattice mismatch induces compressive strain in the V2O3 films, whereas thermal expansion mismatch induces tensile strain. We find that minute changes in substrate morphology may relax the compressive strain component, allowing the thermally-induced tensile component to overcome it. Thus, by simple annealing of the substrates to create either a flat or stepped morphology, strongly compressive or tensile strains may be induced in the films. This results in either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases at all temperatures, exhibiting many orders of magnitude differences in film resistivity. To elucidate the strain relaxation mechanism, we use high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) to image the atomic steps in the substrate and the adjacent crystallographic defects in the V2O3. These findings offer a hitherto underexplored mechanism to tune strain in thin films, deepen our understanding of the effects of structural degrees of freedom on phase stability of a canonical Mott insulator and may allow for applications requiring insulator-metal switching above room temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Topological properties of many-body entanglement in quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.</p>

            <p>Charge order is a widely observed and representative example of spontaneous broken symmetries in quantum states of matter. Owing to the large intra-atomic Coulomb energy, the charge redistribution in such an order typically implies significant alteration of the electronic and lattice properties of materials. While the standard description of charge order, namely a "charge density wave" instability of the Fermi surface, has been broadly and successfully applied to good metals, its applicability to correlated ionic materials has been rather limited. Here, we propose an alternative general scenario of charge order - crystallization of long-lived Frenkel excitons - suitable for these ionic materials. We demonstrate this scenario on the recently discovered kagome superconductors and successfully reproduce all the characteristics of experimental observations on both local charge correlations and long-range ordering. The proposed generic scenario offers a long-sought understanding of charge order applicable to modern correlated functional materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher A. Leong, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>Due to their iconic linearly vanishing density of states near the zero-energy, half-filled two-dimensional Dirac materials in flat Euclidean and negatively-curved hyperbolic spaces exhibit dynamic mass generation only once a critical interaction strength is surpassed. Application of external magnetic fields onto these systems can, however, trigger the formation of such ordered phases yielding isotropic insulation near the band-center at arbitrarily weak coupling, a phenomenon known as magnetic catalysis. Recently, it has been proposed that a specific type of non-Hermiticity, allowing the system to feature an all-real eigenvalue spectrum otherwise squeezed toward the zero-energy, can bring down the requisite critical coupling of a specific family of ordered phases, commuting class masses, to a desired lower finite value in Dirac systems, a phenomenon known as non-Hermitian catalysis (arXiv:2501.18591). Here, we predict that a confluence of external magnetic fields and such a non-Hermiticity can amplify the magnitude of commuting class masses for subcritical strengths of interactions in Dirac liquids, an emergent phenomenon named non-Hermitian amplification of magnetic catalysis. We anchor this prediction from numerical self-consistent mean-field solutions of the commuting class mass charge-density-wave (antiferromagnetic) order displaying a staggered pattern of average electronic density (magnetization) between the nearest neighboring sites of the half-filled Euclidean honeycomb and hyperbolic {10, 3} and {14, 3} lattices, all featuring emergent non-Hermitian Dirac quasiparticles, after decomposing the nearest-neighbor Coulomb (on-site Hubbard) repulsion in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling behavior of these two orders with magnetic field and non-Hermiticity over a wide range of subcritical interactions.. Possible experimental setups to test our predictions are discussed.</p>

Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on 50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91 for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1 Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow, we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units, spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity, power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond thermoelectrics.</p>

            <p>Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</p>

            <p>Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can sometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified configuration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to understand.

We explore the ability of diffusion models to learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-inspired Benchmark for Estimating Intrinsic Dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aritra Das, Joseph T. Iosue, Victor V. Albert</p>
            <p>Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.</p>

            <h2>Non-stabilizerness in quantum-enhanced metrological protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> TanausÃº HernÃ¡ndez-Yanes, Piotr Sierant, Jakub Zakrzewski, Marcin PÅodzieÅ</p>
            <p>Non-stabilizerness (colloquially "magic") characterizes genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) operations necessary for preparation of quantum states, and can be measured by stabilizer RÃ©nyi entropy (SRE). For permutationally symmetric states, we show that the SRE depends, for sufficiently large systems, only on a constant number of expectation values of collective spin operators. This compact description is leveraged for analysis of spin-squeezing protocols, which inherently generate non-stabilizerness. Under one-axis twisting (OAT), the generation of optimal squeezing is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence of SRE with system system size. Continued time evolution under OAT produces metrologically useful "kitten" states-superpositions of rotated GHZ states-that feature many-body Bell correlations but exhibit a smaller, system-size-independent SRE that decreases with increasing Bell-correlation strength. Our results reveal connections between non-stabilizerness, multipartite correlations, and quantum metrology, and provide a practical route to quantify non-stabilizerness in experiments for precision sensing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bence DÃ¡rdai, GÃ¡bor Vattay</p>
            <p>In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</p>

            <h2>Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann</p>
            <p>Tilt-corrected imaging methods in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) have recently emerged as a new class of direct ptychography methods that are especially useful at low dose. The operation of tilt correction unfolds the contrast transfer functions (CTF) of the virtual bright-field images and retains coherence by correcting defocus-induced spatial shifts. By performing summation or subtraction of the tilt-corrected images, the real or imaginary parts of the complex phase-contrast transfer functions are recovered, producing a tilt-corrected bright field image (tcBF) or a differential phase contrast image (tcDPC). However, the CTF can be strongly damped by the introduction of higher-order aberrations than defocus. In this paper, we show how aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF), which combines tcBF and tcDPC, enables continuously-nonzero contrast transfer within the information limit, even in the presence of higher-order aberrations. At Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the resultant phase shift from the probe-forming lens acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF CTF. We demonstrate acBF on both simulated and experimental data, showing it produces superior performance to tcBF or DPC methods alone, and discuss its limitations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawid A. Hryniuk, Marzena H. SzymaÅska</p>
            <p>Competition between short- and long-range interactions underpins many emergent phenomena in nature. Despite rapid progress in their experimental control, computational methods capable of accurately simulating open quantum many-body systems with complex long-ranged interactions at scale remain scarce. Here, we address this limitation by introducing an efficient and scalable approach to dissipative quantum lattices in one and two dimensions, combining matrix product operators and time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. We showcase the versatility, effectiveness, and unique methodological advantages of our algorithm by simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady states of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ lattices with competing algebraically-decaying interactions for as many as $N=200$ sites, revealing the emergence of spatially-modulated magnetic order far from equilibrium. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex non-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable quantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms, ultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youwei Bao, Shuhan Yang, Hyunsoo Yang</p>
            <p>Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel, FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to 18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline. With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106 parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.</p>

            <h2>Mean-field theory of the Santa Fe model revisited: a systematic derivation from an exact BBGKY hierarchy for the zero-intelligence limit-order book model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiki Wakatsuki, Kiyoshi Kanazawa</p>
            <p>The Santa Fe model is an established econophysics model for describing stochastic dynamics of the limit order book from the viewpoint of the zero-intelligence approach. While its foundation was studied by combining a dimensional analysis and a mean-field theory by E. Smith et al. in Quantitative Finance 2003, their arguments are rather heuristic and lack solid mathematical foundation; indeed, their mean-field equations were derived with heuristic arguments and their solutions were not explicitly obtained. In this work, we revisit the mean-field theory of the Santa Fe model from the viewpoint of kinetic theory -- a traditional mathematical program in statistical physics. We study the exact master equation for the Santa Fe model and systematically derive the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchical equation. By applying the mean-field approximation, we derive the mean-field equation for the order-book density profile, parallel to the Boltzmann equation in conventional statistical physics. Furthermore, we obtain explicit and closed expression of the mean-field solutions. Our solutions have several implications: (1)Our scaling formulas are available for both $\mu\to 0$ and $\mu\to \infty$ asymptotics, where $\mu$ is the market-order submission intensity. Particularly, the mean-field theory works very well for small $\mu$, while its validity is partially limited for large $\mu$. (2)The ``method of image'' solution, heuristically derived by Bouchaud-MÃ©zard-Potters in Quantitative Finance 2002, is obtained for large $\mu$, serving as a mathematical foundation for their heuristic arguments. (3)Finally, we point out an error in E. Smith et al. 2003 in the scaling law for the diffusion constant due to a misspecification in their dimensional analysis.</p>

            <p>We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\rm int} \gtrsim 3\times10^9$ at the single-photon level below 20\,mK, which corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\tau_{\rm int}\sim90\,\mathrm{ms}$. Moreover, $Q_{\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Single photons in Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), could enable more robust and efficient photonic quantum communication and information processing, as well as enhanced sensitivity in quantum metrology and imaging. However, as most implementations are indirect or require additional mode-shaping elements, direct generation of single photons with OAM has received growing interest. Colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can produce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate. Here, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity with a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up to 18.1 $\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By in-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD to different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the generated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity. Our findings open the door to high photon rate sources that directly generate single-photon LG beams for advanced quantum photonic applications.</p>

A minimal example is a single lattice protein confined on a minimal grid, with no free sites. Finding its minimum energy is a hard optimization problem, withsimilarities to scheduling problems.

We show that this problem in its QUBO form can be swiftly and consistently solved for chain length 48, using either classical simulated annealing or hybrid quantum-classical annealing on a D-Wave system. In fact, the latter computations required about 10 seconds. We also test linear and quadratic programming methods, which work well for a lattice gas but struggle with chain constraints. All methods are benchmarked against exact results obtained from exhaustive structure enumeration, at a high computational cost.</p>

            <p>Diagonal linear networks (DLNs) are a tractable model that captures several nontrivial behaviors in neural network training, such as initialization-dependent solutions and incremental learning. These phenomena are typically studied in isolation, leaving the overall dynamics insufficiently understood.

Using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT), we derive a low-dimensional effective process that captures the asymptotic gradient flow dynamics in high dimensions. Analyzing this effective process yields new insights into DLN dynamics, including loss convergence rates and their trade-off with generalization, and systematically reproduces many of the previously observed phenomena. These findings deepen our understanding of DLNs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DMFT approach in analyzing high-dimensional learning dynamics of neural networks.</p>

            <p>Simulating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. However, a faithful digital quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\_fez. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation.</p>

            <p>Quantum phenomena offer the possibility of measuring physical quantities with precision beyond classical limits. However, current progress is constrained by scalability, environmental noise, and challenges in practical integration. This highlights the necessity for novel approaches. An emerging paradigm in this direction is \emph{critical quantum metrology} -- which harnesses the enhanced susceptibility and nonclassical correlations naturally occurring near quantum phase transitions as resources for quantum-enhanced precision. This tutorial provides a pedagogical introduction to key concepts and a detailed overview of prominent quantum sensing strategies that exploit critical phenomena in metrology. Through examples of increasing complexity, the reader is guided through various critical quantum sensing protocols applied to different critical systems. Special emphasis is placed on the optimal scaling of estimation precision with respect to fundamental resources. Finally, we discuss how critical quantum metrology extends from idealized models to realistic open-system and dissipative regimes, and outline both the challenges and opportunities for future quantum technologies.</p>

In particular, we demonstrate how to perform a gate-based quantum computer simulation of quantum annealing for the Hubbard Hamiltonian. We perform simulations for systems with up to 40 qubits to study the scaling of required annealing time for obtaining the ground state. We find that for the half-filled cases considered, there is a substantial quantum speed-up over algorithms based on the Bethe-ansatz equations.</p>

            <p>We study chaotic many-body quantum dynamics in a minimal model with spatial structure and local interactions. It has a time-independent Hamiltonian, in contrast to much-studied quantum circuits, and is analytically tractable for large local Hilbert space dimension and weak intersite coupling. In this limit we show that energy dynamics is described by a classical master equation and is diffusive. We also show that the spectral form factor can be expressed exactly in terms of the solution to this master equation. For a two-site system we obtain closed-form expressions for both the two-point correlator of energy density and the spectral form factor, in essentially perfect agreement with numerical simulations. For an $L$-site system we show at late times how a linear ramp emerges in the spectral form factor, as universally expected from level repulsion in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, at earlier times we identify two distinct mechanisms for an increase of the spectral form factor above its ramp value. One of these is associated with energy diffusion and is effective until the Thouless time, which varies as $L^2$. The other involves contributions like those that would appear if the system were composed of many uncoupled subsystems: they generate a large enhancement of the spectral form factor, and are suppressed on a timescale varying as $(\ln L)^2$. Besides being exact for the limit considered, we believe our approach provides the natural approximation even for small local Hilbert space dimension and strong intersite coupling. We present a numerical study of a spin-half chain, finding an early-time enhancement of the spectral form factor which is qualitatively similar to that in our solvable model.</p>

            <p>Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the RÃ©nyi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric RÃ©nyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the RÃ©nyi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean RÃ©nyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric RÃ©nyi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the RÃ©nyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ RÃ©nyi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.</p>

            <p>Rydberg-cavity systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. These hybrid architectures combine two complementary interaction mechanisms: cavity photons mediate collective long-range couplings, while Rydberg excitations generate strong short-range interactions. Together, they offer a setting for engineering many-body phases characterized by a hierarchy of interactions across widely different length scales. In this work, we introduce a minimal and scalable model for such systems. Focusing on the strong Rydberg blockade regime, we restrict the Hilbert space to the subspace enforced by the blockade, yielding a kinetically constrained long-range model in one spatial dimension. This approach both captures the physics of Rydberg-cavity experiments in the regime of strong Rydberg interactions and provides a conceptually transparent framework for studying the interplay of long-range and short-range interactions. At equilibrium, in addition to paramagnetic and NÃ©el-ordered phases, the system supports a blockaded ferromagnetic/superradiant phase, distinct from the conventional superradiant phase. Out of equilibrium, we identify long-range quantum many-body scars, which are atypical nonthermal eigenstates that evade the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and giving rise to slow entanglement growth. In contrast to the linear-in-time entanglement growth characteristic of short-range scarred models, these long-range scars exhibit logarithmic entanglement dynamics. Our results establish a minimal yet versatile framework for Rydberg-cavity systems, and provide a stepping stone for future theoretical and experimental studies of this frontier platform in quantum many-body physics.</p>

            <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.</p>

            <h2>Lower bounds on the complexity of preparing mixed states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max McGinley, Samuel J. Garratt</p>
            <p>We establish a relationship between the correlations in a many-qubit mixed state and the minimum circuit depth needed for its preparation. If the mutual information between two subsystems exceeds the mutual information between one of those subsystems and the environment, which purifies the mixed state of the system, then the past lightcones of the subsystems must intersect one another. This results in a lower bound on the circuit depth of any ensemble of geometrically local unitaries that prepares the state to some specified degree of approximation. As an application, we derive lower bounds on the circuit depth needed to prepare thermal states of one-dimensional quantum critical systems described by conformal field theory, showing that the depth diverges as temperature is decreased up to a cutoff set by the preparation error.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Belief Propagation: Cluster-Corrected Tensor Network Contraction with Exponential Convergence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddhant Midha, Yifan F. Zhang</p>
            <p>Tensor network contraction on arbitrary graphs is a fundamental computational challenge with applications ranging from quantum simulation to error correction. While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation algorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and systematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical mechanics to devise a \emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the BP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially fast if an object called the \emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast with the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising model, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and existing corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion. Our work opens the door to a systematic theory of BP for tensor networks and its applications in decoding classical and quantum error-correcting codes and simulating quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Franco Moitzi, Lorenz Romaner, Andrei V. Ruban, Oleg E. Peil</p>
            <p>High entropy alloys (HEA) represent a class of materials with promising properties, such as high strength and ductility, radiation damage tolerance, etc. At the same time, a combinatorially large variety of compositions and a complex structure render them quite hard to study using conventional methods. In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology based on ab initio calculations within the coherent potential approximation. To make the methodology predictive, we apply an exchange-correlation correction to the equation of state and take into account thermal effects on the magnetic state and the equilibrium volume. The approach shows good agreement with available experimental data on bulk properties of solid solutions. As a particular case, the workflow is applied to a series of iron-group HEA to investigate their solid solution strengthening within a parameter-free model based on the effective medium representation of an alloy. The results reveal intricate interactions between alloy components, which we analyze by means of a simple model of local bonding. Thanks to its computational efficiency, the methodology can be used as a basis for an adaptive learning workflow for optimal design of HEA.</p>

            <p>Nanofabricated metal gate electrodes are commonly used to confine and control electrons in electrostatically defined quantum dots. However, these same gates impart strain-induced potential fluctuations that can potentially impair device functionality. Here we investigate strain fluctuations in Si/SiGe heterostructures, caused by (i) lattice mismatch, (ii) materials-dependent thermal contraction, and (iii) depositional stress in the metal gates. By simulating gate geometries, ranging from simple to realistically complicated, we identify two opposing effects in overlapping gate structures: (a) gate-driven behavior arising from isolated gates vs (b) oxide-driven behavior arising from the thin oxides separating the gates in an overlapping geometry. These limiting behaviors induce strains of opposite sign, pointing towards the possibility of suppressing strain fluctuations through careful design. Here, we demonstrate nearly total suppression of short-range strain fluctuation through device optimization. These results suggest that strain fluctuations should not pose an insurmountable challenge to qubit uniformity, provided that oxide and overlapping gate thicknesses can be tuned.</p>

            <h2>Solution of the mean-field Hubbard model of graphene rectangulenes</h2>

            <p>We present a complete analytical solution of the mean-field Hubbard model of undoped and doped graphene rectangulenes. These are non-chiral ribbons of arbitrary length and width, whose dimensions range from simple short acene molecules all the way up to the bulk limit. We rewrite the Hubbard model in the basis of bulk and edge non-interacting eigen-states, and provide explicit expressions for the Coulomb matrix elements. We present a general mean-field decoupling of the Hamiltonian, and discuss in detail the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic mean-field solutions. We calculate the eigen-energies, occupations, spin densities and addition energies of rectangulenes with lengths and widths ranging from a nanometer to several hundreds of them. We rewrite the exact mean-field tight-binding Hamiltonian back in the site-occupation basis, that can be used to model electronic, thermo-electric, transport and optical properties of experimental-size graphene flakes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirokazu Maruoka, Hisao Hayakawa</p>
            <p>This study investigates the phenomenon of the early-stage dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, where materials undergo solidification upon impact. While Stokes flow theory traditionally applies to suspensions with micrometer-sized particles due to their low Reynolds numbers, suspensions containing larger particles defy such idealizations. Our work focuses on the early-stage impact-induced hardening of suspensions containing millimeter-sized particles through dynamic impact experiments. We are particularly interested in the maximum drag force $F_\mathrm{max}$ acting on the projectile as a function of the impact speed $u_0$. We successfully conducted experiments using these suspensions and confirmed the relation $F_\mathrm{max}\sim u_0^{3/2}$ for relatively large $u_0$ as observed in the previous studies suspensions of micrometer-sized particles. Our findings reveal that the early-stage behaviors of millimeter-sized particle suspensions align well with predictions from the floating model, typically applicable under Stokes flow conditions. This research sheds light on the complex dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, particularly with larger particles, advancing our understanding beyond conventional micrometer-sized systems.</p>

            <p>Using a mechanical cantilever submitted to electrostatic feedback control, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of an information engine that extracts work from thermal fluctuations. The cantilever position is rapidly sampled and the feedback is triggered by the first passage of the system across a fixed threshold. The information $\Delta I$ associated with the feedback is based on the first-passage-time distribution. In this setting, we derive and experimentally verify two distinct fluctuation theorems that involve $\Delta I$ and give a tight bound on the work produced by the engine. Our results extend beyond the specific application to our experiment: we develop a general framework for obtaining fluctuation theorems and work bounds, formulated in terms of probability distributions of protocols rather than underlying measurement outcomes.</p>

            <p>Magnetic solitons such as skyrmions and bimerons show great promise for both fundamental research and spintronic applications. Stabilizing and controlling topological spin textures in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) materials has gained tremendous attention due to high tunability, enhanced functionality, and miniaturization. Here, we present an efficient spin-spiral approach based on first-principles, a method for mapping magnetic interactions from collective models onto arbitrary lattice symmetries, such as hexagonal and honeycomb lattices. Using atomistic spin models parametrized from first-principles, we predict the emergence of multiple topological spin textures in an all-magnetic vdW heterostructure Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (FGT/CGT) -- an experimentally feasible system. Interestingly, the FGT layer favors out-of-plane magnetization, whereas the CGT layer prefers in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy. NÃ©el-type nanoscale skyrmions are formed at zero field in the FGT layer due to interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), while nanoscale bimerons and antibimerons can co-exist in the CGT layer by the interplay between exchange frustration and DMI. Using the collective approach we apply, we reveal significant discretization effects in hexagonal and honeycomb geometries. In particular, we demonstrate that the lifting of geometric exchange frustration on the honeycomb significantly affects soliton barriers and pinning energetics. These fundamental results not only highlight the importance of spin simulations in discrete models for topological magnetism, especially in 2D materials, but may also help to pave the way for solitonic devices based on atomically thin vdW heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We propose a geometric series modulated non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice model, and explore its localization and topological properties. The results show that with the ever-increasing summation terms of the geometric series, multiple mobility edges and non-Hermitian point gaps with high winding number can be induced in the system. The point gap spectrum of the system has a multi-loop nested structure in the complex plane, resulting in a high winding number. In addition, we analyze the limit case of summation of infinite terms. The results show that the mobility edges merge together as only one mobility edge when summation terms are pushed to the limit. Meanwhile, the corresponding point gaps are merged into a ring with winding number equal to one. Through Avila's global theory, we give an analytical expression for mobility edges in the limit of infinite summation, reconfirming that mobility edges and point gaps do merge and will result in a winding number that is indeed equal to one.</p>

            <p>We formulate the problem of near-field radiative heat transfer as an effective quantum scattering theory for excitations of the matter. Built from the same ingredients as the semiclassical fluctuational electrodynamics, the standard tool to handle this problem, our construction makes manifest its relation to the Landauer-BÃ¼ttiker scattering framework, which appears only implicitly in the fluctuational electrodynamics. We show how to construct the scattering matrix for the matter excitations and give a general expression for the energy current in terms of this scattering matrix. We show that the energy current has an important non-dissipative contribution that can dominate the finite-frequency noise while being absent in the average current. Our construction provides a unified description of near-field radiative heat transfer in diverse physical systems.</p>

Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we determine the nature and spin Hamiltonian parameters of this radical. We also demonstrate that the NH spin center exhibits a relatively long coherence time, making it a strong candidate for quantum sensing. Since this spin center is intrinsic to TPA-NH2 linkers, our findings open new directions for leveraging organic radicals in MOFs for quantum technologies beyond the UiO-66-NH2 family.</p>

            <h2>A Simple and General Equation for Matrix Product Unitary Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujeet K. Shukla</p>
            <p>Matrix Product Unitaries (MPUs) have emerged as essential tools for representing locality-preserving 1D unitary operators, with direct applications to quantum cellular automata and quantum phases of matter. A key challenge in the study of MPUs is determining when a given local tensor generates an MPU, a task previously addressed through fixed-point conditions and canonical forms, which can be cumbersome to evaluate for an arbitrary tensor. In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor $M$ to generate an MPU of size $N$, given by $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_M^N) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_T^N) = 1$, where $\mathbb{E}_M$ and $\mathbb{E}_T$ are the transfer matrices of $M$ and $T = MM^\dagger$. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.</p>

            <p>The statistics of randomly branching double-folded ring polymers are relevant to the secondary structure of RNA, the large-scale branching of plectonemic DNA (and thus bacterial chromosomes), the conformations of single-ring polymers migrating through an array of obstacles, as well as to the conformational statistics of eukaryotic chromosomes and melts of crumpled, non-concatenated ring polymers. Double-folded rings fall into different dynamical universality classes depending on whether the random tree-like graphs underlying the double-folding are quenched or annealed, and whether the trees can undergo unhindered Brownian motion in their spatial embedding. Locally, one can distinguish (i) repton-like mass transport around a fixed tree, (ii) the spontaneous creation and deletion of side branches, and (iii) displacements of tree node, where complementary ring segments diffuse together in space. Here we employ dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a suitable elastic lattice polymer model of double-folded, randomly branching ring polymers to explore the mesoscopic dynamics that emerge from different combinations of the above local modes in three different systems: ideal non-interacting rings, self-avoiding rings, and rings in the melt state. We observe the expected scaling regimes for ring reptation, the dynamics of double-folded rings in an array of obstacles, and Rouse-like tree dynamics as limiting cases. Of particular interest, the monomer mean-square displacements of $g_1\sim t^{0.4}$ observed for crumpled rings with $\nu=1/3$ are similar to the subdiffusive regime observed in bacterial chromosomes. In our analysis, we focus on the question to which extent contributions of different local dynamical modes to the emergent dynamics are simply additive. Notably, we reveal a non-trivial acceleration of the dynamics of interacting rings, when all three types of local motion are present.</p>

            <p>Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for next generation photovoltaic applications, attracting significant attention in recent years. Through first-principles calculations combined with group-theoretical analyses, we investigate the structural phase diagram of Pb-free Jahn-Teller-active $A_2$Au$_2X_6$ ($A$: Cs, Rb; $X$: Cl, Br, I) double perovskites. Our study identifies a previously unreported ferroelectric phase, where the softening of the polar mode$, $key to ferroelectricity, is driven by an unconventional and indirect coupling with improper strains originating from Jahn-Teller distortions. The proposed strain mediated \textit{pseudo}triggered mechanism offers an alternative pathway to enhance the static dielectric constant or even promote (photo-)ferroelectricity, addressing challenges such as defects, excitons, and charge scattering that hinder photovoltaic efficiency. More broadly, this unique mechanism could be extended to oxide double perovskites and opens up a new type of ferroelectric phase transition worthy of future investigation.</p>

Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulation to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge density wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</p>

The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We show that the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving gives rise to a morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. Additionally, we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law, derived using insights from stochastic thermodynamics, that robustly describes vesicle growth dynamics even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.</p>

            <p>We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for extracting material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium from experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach relies on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{Ã¶}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends solely on the single material parameter $\mu$. Furthermore, we develop an analytical formula with high accuracy for magnetoexciton energies as a function of the exciton reduced mass: $E(B,\mu)$. Then, the inverse of this formula allows us to calculate the exciton reduced mass from experimental data on magnetoexciton energies. By applying this method, we extract key material parameters, $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$, from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs, including WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$, encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. The material properties we retrieve complement and correct existing experimental and theoretical data. Additionally, we develop an analytical method for calculating diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii with high accuracy compared to numerical calculations. Based on this method, we provide diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii computed using the extracted material parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Skliannyi, Yuval Oreg, Ady Stern</p>
            <p>We propose a way to generate a one-dimensional topological superconductor from a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a Bernal-stacked bilayer of graphene under a displacement field. With proper gating, this structure may be tuned to form three parallel pads of superconductors creating two planar Josephson junctions in series, in which normal regions separate the superconductors. Two characteristics of the system which are essential for our discussion are spin orbit coupling induced by the transition metal dichalcogenides and the variation of the Fermi velocities along the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that these two characteristics lead to one-dimensional topological superconductivity occupying large parts in the parameter space defined by the two phase differences across the two junctions and the relative angle between the junctions and the lattice. An angle-shaped device in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning, can lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial phases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully designed devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show that Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum. Our analysis shows that the transition to a gapped topological state is a result of the band inversion of Andreev states.</p>

Using the method of direct integration the equation of motion, pioneered by Kac, we obtain exact moments for the Laplace transform of the time dependent ABRTP, in the presence or absence of a harmonic trap. In addition we estimate the distribution moments with the help of the Chebyshev polynomials. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments.</p>

            <p>We consider the effect of non-reciprocity in a binary mixture of self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions, where a particle of type A reacts differently to a particle of type B than vice versa. Starting from a well-known microscopic Langevin-model for the particles, setting up the corresponding exact N-particle Fokker-Planck equation and making Boltzmann's assumptions of low density and one-sided molecular chaos, the non-linear active Boltzmann equation with the exact collision operator is derived. In this derivation, the effect of phase-space compression and the build-up of pair-correlations during binary interactions is explicitly taken into account, leading to a theoretical description beyond mean-field. This extends previous results for reciprocal interactions, where it was found that orientational order can emerge in a system with purely anti-aligning interactions. Although the equations of motion are more complex than in the reciprocal system, the theory still leads to analytical expressions and predictions. Comparisons with agent-based simulations show excellent quantitative agreement of the dynamic and static behavior in the low density and/or small coupling limit.</p>

Magnetic correlations, such as those arising from ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic exchange, promote cluster formation, magnetic domain structures, and spin fluctuations, all of which critically influence thermoelectric responses. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations based on Ising and Heisenberg models of these surface exchange interactions, we analyze how magnetic clustering, particularly near the surface critical temperature, affects relaxation dynamics, electrical and thermal resistivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the thermoelectric figure of merit. Our results demonstrate that exchange-driven magnetic clustering enhances the scattering of Dirac surface states, thereby increasing the thermoelectric power factor. Specifically, optimized interlayer and intralayer exchange interactions can elevate the surface thermopower beyond levels observed in conventional spin-based thermoelectric materials. These findings highlight the significant potential of magnetic TIs for thermoelectric applications and provide a foundation for future experimental and theoretical studies of magnetic correlations in topologically nontrivial systems.</p>

            <h2>Hyperspherical Analysis of Dimer-Dimer Scattering in One-Dimensional Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Wang, Hui Hu, Xia-Ji Liu</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive analysis of four-body scattering in one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation (AHR). Focusing on dimer-dimer collisions between two species of fermions interacting via the sinh-cosh potential, we implement the slow variable discretization (SVD) method to overcome numerical challenges posed by sharp avoided crossings in the potential curves. Our numerical approach is benchmarked against exact analytical results available in integrable regimes, demonstrating excellent agreement. We further explore non-integrable regimes where no analytical solutions exist, revealing novel features such as resonant enhancement of the scattering length associated with tetramer formation. These results highlight the power and flexibility of the AHR+SVD framework for accurate few-body scattering calculations in low-dimensional quantum systems, and establish a foundation for future investigations of universal few-body physics in ultracold gases.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling contributions to longitudinal magnetoconductivity for Kramers-Weyl nodes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We set out to compute the longitudinal magnetoconductivity for an isolated and isotropic Kramers-Weyl node (KWN), existing in chiral crystals, which forms an exotic cousin of the conventional Weyl nodes resulting from band-inversions. The peculiarities of KWNs are many, the principal one being the presence of two concentric Fermi surfaces at any positive chemical potential ($\mu$) with respect to the nodal point. This is caused by a dominant quadratic-in-momentum dispersion, with the linear-in-momentum Dirac- or Weyl-like terms relegated to a secondary status. In a KWN, the chirally-conjugate node typically serves as a mere doppelgÃ¤nger, being significantly separated in energy. Hence, when $\mu$ is set near such a node, the signatures of a lone node are probed in the transport-measurements. The intrinsic topological quantities in the forms of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment contribute to the linear response, which we determine by exactly solving the semiclassical Bolzmann equations. Another crucial feature is that the two bands at the same KWN node carry actual spin-quantum numbers, thus providing an additional coupling to an external magnetic field ($\boldsymbol B$), and affecting the conductivity. We take this into account as well, and demonstrate that it causes a linear-in-$B$ dependence, on top of the usual $B^2$-dependence.</p>

            <h2>Fokker-Planck Score Learning: Efficient Free-Energy Estimation under Periodic Boundary Conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Nagel, Tristan Bereau</p>
            <p>Accurate free-energy estimation is essential in molecular simulation, yet the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) commonly used in computer simulations have rarely been explicitly exploited. Equilibrium methods such as umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and adaptive biasing force require extensive sampling, while non-equilibrium pulling with Jarzynski's equality suffers from poor convergence due to exponential averaging. Here, we introduce a physics-informed, score-based diffusion framework: by mapping PBC simulations onto a Brownian particle in a periodic potential, we derive the Fokker-Planck steady-state score that directly encodes free-energy gradients. A neural network is trained on non-equilibrium trajectories to learn this score, providing a principled scheme to efficiently reconstruct the potential of mean force (PMF). On benchmark periodic potentials and small-molecule membrane permeation, our method is up to one order of magnitude more efficient than umbrella sampling.</p>

            <h2>Spin Seebeck Effect of Triangular-lattice Spin Supersolid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Gao, Yixuan Huang, Sadamichi Maekawa, Wei Li</p>
            <p>Using thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling behaviors of the normalized spin current across the interface. For the 1D Heisenberg chain, we find a negative spinon spin in the bulk current with algebraic temperature scaling; at low fields, boundary effects induce a second sign reversal at lower temperatures. These benchmark results are consistent with field-theoretical analysis. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with distinct spin-current signatures -- particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence -- distinguishing different spin states. Remarkably, we discover a persistent, negative spin current in the spin supersolid phase, which saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits provide sensitive spin current probes for spin supersolid states in quantum magnets such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Furthermore, our results also establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.</p>

            <h2>The Symmetry Taco: Equivalences between Gapped, Gapless, and Mixed-State SPTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marvin Qi, Ramanjit Sohal, Xie Chen, David T. Stephen, Abhinav Prem</p>
            <p>Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, offers a unifying framework for describing quantum phases of matter and phase transitions between them. While this approach has seen remarkable success in describing gapped and gapless pure-state phases in $1+1$d, its applicability to open quantum systems remains entirely unexplored. In this work, we propose a natural extension of the SymTFT framework to mixed-state phases by introducing the \textit{symmetry taco}: a bilayer topological order in $2+1$d whose folded geometry naturally encapsulates both strong and weak symmetries of the $1+1$d theory. We use this perspective to identify a series of correspondences, including a one-to-one map between intrinsically gapless SPTs (igSPTs) and certain gapped SPTs, and a mapping between igSPTs and intrinsically average SPTs (iASPTs) arising in $1+1$d mixed states. More broadly, our framework yields a classification of short-range correlated $G$-symmetric Choi states in $1+1$d, provides a route for systematically generating mixed-state SPTs via local decoherence of igSPTs, and allows us to identify a new mixed-state ``anomaly". Besides folding in mixed-state phases into the SymTFT paradigm, the symmetry taco opens new avenues for exploring dualities, anomalies, and non-equilibrium criticality in mixed-state quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Perfect Superconducting Diode and Supercurrent Range Controller</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cliff Sun, Ziqi Zhao, Alexey Bezryadin</p>
            <p>Diodes have a nonreciprocal voltage versus current relationship, produced by breaking the space and time reversal symmetry. However, developing high-end superconducting computers requires a superconducting analogue of the traditional semiconductor diode. Such a superconducting diode exhibits non-reciprocity, or a high asymmetry in its critical currents. We present a model of a perfect superconducting diode based on a superconducting quantum interference device made with multiple superconducting nanowires. The diode predicted by our model has a large positive critical current, while the negative critical current can be exactly zero. This 100\% diode efficiency ($\eta = 1$) remains stable against small changes of the magnetic field. Another important result is that under certain and quite broad conditions such devices can act as supercurrent range controllers. In such device a supercurrent can flow with zero voltage applied, but only if the supercurrent is contained in some narrow, adjustable range, which excludes zero current.</p>

            <p>Spatial entanglement of wave functions has matured into an enthralling and very active research area. Here, we unearth a completely different kind of entanglement, the entanglement between different time scales. This is feasible through quantics tensor train diagnostics (QTTD), wherein the bond dimension for an $n$-particle correlation function allows diagnosing the temporal entanglement. As examples, we study time-scale entanglement of the Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. Besides introducing the QTTD method, our major finding is that the time-scale entanglement is generically maximal at phase transitions and crossovers. This is independent of the correlation function studied. Thus, QTTD is a universal tool for detecting quantum phase transitions, ground state crossings in finite systems, and thermal crossovers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Li, Huiju Lee, Chris Wolverton, Yi Xia</p>
            <p>Accurately predicting lattice thermal conductivity (kL) from first principles remains a challenge in identifying materials with extreme thermal behavior. While modern lattice dynamics methods enable routine predictions of kL within the harmonic approximation and three-phonon scattering framework (HA+3ph), reliable results, especially for low-kL compounds, require higher-order anharmonic effects, including self-consistent phonon renormalization, four-phonon scattering, and off-diagonal heat flux (SCPH+3,4ph+OD). We present a high-throughput workflow integrating these effects into a unified framework. Using this, we compute kL for 773 cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds across diverse chemistries and structures. From 562 dynamically stable compounds, we assess the hierarchical effects of higher-order anharmonicity. For about 60% of materials, HA+3ph predictions closely match those from SCPH+3,4ph+OD. However, SCPH corrections often increase kL, sometimes by over 8 times, while four-phonon scattering universally reduces it, occasionally to 15% of the HA+3ph value. Off-diagonal contributions are minor in high-kL systems but can be comparable to the diagonal ones in highly anharmonic, low-kL compounds. We highlight four cases-Rb2TlAlH6, Cu3VS4, CuBr, and KTlCl4-exhibiting distinct anharmonic behaviors. This work delivers not only a robust workflow for high-fidelity kL dataset but also a quantitative framework to determine when higher-order effects are essential. The hierarchy of kL results, from the HA+3ph to SCPH+3,4ph+OD level, offers a scalable, interpretable route to discovering next-generation extreme thermal materials.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Fragmented Dopant Dynamics in Quantum Spin Lattices: Robust Localization and non-Gaussian Diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingru Yang, Sajant Anand, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen</p>
            <p>The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, which increases exponentially with decreasing temperature. The dopant, hereby, only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes at rate $\alpha$, the dopant diffuses with a diffusion coefficient, $D_h$, depending non-monotonically on $\alpha$. It initially increases linearly as $D_h \propto \alpha$ for $\alpha \ll 1$ before dropping off as $\alpha^{-1}$ for $\alpha > 1$. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics features self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion, especially for weak spin exchange. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient $D_h$ follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it is exponentially suppressed upon cooling.</p>

            <p>Topological features of possible three-dimensional (3D) states in \alpha-type layered organic conductors are investigated within a unified framework based on Wannier charge centers (WCCs), aiming to identify their actual topological states. Among the 3D Dirac/Weyl semimetal states of multilayered \alpha-(ET)2I3, the type-I Dirac semimetal state, induced by interlayer spin-orbit coupling (SOC), most effectively explains the observed chiral transport phenomena attributed to the chiral magnetic effect, which originates from the spiral structures of the WCC sheets. In multilayered \alpha-(BETS)2I3, a 3D weak topological insulator (TI) state consistently emerges, irrespective of the presence of interlayer SOC and/or inversion symmetry breaking. The strong TI state suggested by experimental observations appears unlikely to be realized.</p>

            <p>Electric and magnetic multipole densities in crystalline solids, including the familiar electric dipole density in ferroelectrics and the magnetic dipole density in ferromagnets, are of central importance for our understanding of ordered phases in matter. However, determining the magnitude of these quantities has proven to be conceptually and technically difficult. Here we present a universally applicable approach, based on projection operators, that yields gauge-invariant absolute measures for all types of electric and magnetic order in crystals. We demonstrate the utility of the general theory using concrete examples of electric and magnetic multipole order in variants of lonsdaleite and diamond structures. Besides the magnetic dipole density in ferromagnets, we also consider, e.g., the magnetic octupole density in altermagnets. The robust method developed in this work lends itself to be incorporated into the suite of computational materials-science tools. The multipole densities can be used as thermodynamic state variables including Landau order parameters.</p>

            <p>We propose generalized variants of the $XY$ model capable of exhibiting an arbitrary number of phase transitions only by varying temperature. They are constructed by supplementing the magnetic coupling with $n_t-1$ nematic terms of exponentially increasing order with the base $q=2,3,4$ and $5$, and increasing interaction strength. It is found that for $q=2,3$ and $4$ with sufficiently large coupling strength of the final term, the models exhibit a number of phase transitions equal to the number of the terms in the generalized Hamiltonian. Starting from the paramagnetic phase, the system transitions through the cascade of $n_t-1$ nematic phases of the orders $q^{k}$, $k=n_t-1,n_t-2,\hdots,1$, that are characterized by $q^{k}$ preferential spin directions symmetrically disposed around the circle, to the ferromagnetic (FM) phase at the lowest temperatures. Besides the BKT transition from the paramagnetic phase, all the remaining transitions have a non-BKT nature: depending on the value of $q$ they belong to either the Ising ($q=2$ and $4$) or the three-states Potts ($q=3$) universality class. For $q=5$, due to the interplay between different terms, the phase transitions between the ordered phases observed for $q<5$ split into two and the number of the ordered phases increases to $2n_t-1$. These phases are characterized by a domain structure with the gradually increasing short-range FM ordering within domains that extends to different kinds of FM ordering in the last two low-temperature phases. The respective transitions do not seem to obey any universality.</p>

            <p>We present C-BerryTrans, a C++ code designed for first-principles calculations of Berry-curvature-driven transverse transport properties, namely the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) i.e., $\sigma_{\mu \nu}^{AHC}$ and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) i.e., $\alpha_{\mu \nu}^{ANC}$. The code directly extracts eigenvalues and momentum-matrix elements from WIEN2k calculations and evaluates the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) using a Kubo-like formalism. For computational efficiency, C-BerryTrans parallelizes $\boldsymbol\Omega$ evaluation over k-points using OpenMP and stores band-resolved curvature in binary format. This design enables rapid post-processing of AHC and ANC over a wide range of temperatures and chemical potentials ($\mu$) in a single run. The code has been benchmarked on well-studied ferromagnetic materials (Fe, Fe$_3$Ge, Pd, Fe$_3$Al, and Co$_2$FeAl). For Fe, the $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$775 ($\sim$744) $S/cm$ at 0 (300) K. In case of Fe$_3$Ge, the calculated value of $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is found to be 311 $S/cm$ at the room temperature. Nextly, for Co$_2$FeAl, the magnitude of computed value of $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ at 2 K is found to be $\sim$56 $S/cm$. Next, magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for Pd is obtained to be $\sim$0.97 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K. For Fe$_3$Al, the maximum magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for $T\leq$500 K is computed as $\sim$2.83 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$. Lastly, for Co$_2$FeAl, the value of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$0.10 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K. These results show good agreement with previously reported data. With its accuracy, scalability, and user-friendly workflow, C-BerryTrans provides a powerful tool for exploring $\boldsymbol\Omega$-driven transport phenomena and is well suited for high-throughput materials discovery.</p>

In this work, we demonstrate tailored superconductivity in polycrystalline niobium thin films exposed to femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulses. The samples exhibit significant changes in their superconducting properties, directly connected with the observed topography, crystallite geometry, and lattice parameter modifications. On the mesoscopic scale, quasi-parallel periodic ripple structures (about 260 nm of spatial period) gradually form on the film surface by progressively increasing the laser energy per pulse, Ep. This gives way to a stepwise increase of the critical current anisotropy and magnetic flux channeling effects along the ripples. As demonstrated in our resistive and inductive measurements, these superstructures determine the electromagnetic response of the sample within the regime dominated by flux-pinning. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations corroborate the topographical origin of the customized anisotropy. Concurrently, intrinsic superconducting parameters (critical field and temperature) are moderately and isotropically depressed upon increasing Ep, as is the lattice parameter of Nb. These findings promote pulsed laser processing as a flexible, one-step, and scalable lithography-free technique for versatile surface functionalization in microelectronic superconducting technology.</p>

            <p>Transformers have a remarkable ability to learn and execute tasks based on examples provided within the input itself, without explicit prior training. It has been argued that this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), is a cornerstone of Transformers' success, yet questions about the necessary sample complexity, pretraining task diversity, and context length for successful ICL remain unresolved. Here, we provide a precise answer to these questions in an exactly solvable model of ICL of a linear regression task by linear attention. We derive sharp asymptotics for the learning curve in a phenomenologically-rich scaling regime where the token dimension is taken to infinity; the context length and pretraining task diversity scale proportionally with the token dimension; and the number of pretraining examples scales quadratically. We demonstrate a double-descent learning curve with increasing pretraining examples, and uncover a phase transition in the model's behavior between low and high task diversity regimes: In the low diversity regime, the model tends toward memorization of training tasks, whereas in the high diversity regime, it achieves genuine in-context learning and generalization beyond the scope of pretrained tasks. These theoretical insights are empirically validated through experiments with both linear attention and full nonlinear Transformer architectures.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying non-Hermiticity using single- and many-particle quantum properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke, Sudipto Singha Roy</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian paradigm of quantum systems displays salient features drastically different from Hermitian counterparts. In this work, we focus on one such aspect, the difference of evolving quantum ensembles under $H_{\mathrm{nh}}$ (right ensemble) versus its Hermitian conjugate, $H_{\mathrm{nh}}^{\dagger}$ (left ensemble). We propose a formalism that quantifies the (dis-)similarity of these right and left ensembles, for single- as well as many-particle quantum properties. Such a comparison gives us a scope to measure the extent to which non-Hermiticity gets translated from the Hamiltonian into physically observable properties. We test the formalism in two cases: First, we construct a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian using a set of imperfect Bell states, showing that the non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian does not automatically comply with the non-Hermiticity at the level of observables. Second, we study the interacting Hatano--Nelson model with asymmetric hopping as a paradigmatic quantum many-body Hamiltonian. Interestingly, we identify situations where the measures of non-Hermiticity computed for the Hamiltonian, for single-, and for many-particle quantum properties behave distinctly from each other. Thus, different notions of non-Hermiticity can become useful in different physical scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the measures can qualitatively mark the model's Parity--Time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition. Our findings can be instrumental in unveiling new exotic quantum phases of non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems as well as in preparing resourceful states for quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Magneto-optical properties of Group-IV--vacancy centers in diamond upon hydrostatic pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meysam Mohseni, Lukas Razinkovas, Vytautas Å½alandauskas, GergÅ Thiering, Adam Gali</p>
            <p>In recent years, the negatively charged group-IV--vacancy defects in diamond, labeled as G4V(-) or G4V centers, have attracted significant attention in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up to 180 GPa. The spin-orbit splitting of the electronic ground and excited states, as well as the hyperfine tensors, are calculated using plane-wave supercell density functional theory, providing distinctive fingerprints that uniquely characterize these defects. To this end, we develop a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the electronic states are subject to the Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the zero-phonon-line energy increases with hydrostatic pressure, with the deformation potential increasing from SiV(-) to PbV(-). On the other hand, our calculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that PbV(-)-based quantum sensors can operate only up to 32 GPa, whereas SnV(-), GeV(-), and SiV(-) remain photostable up to 180 GPa. We also find that the spin-orbit splitting increases in both the electronic ground and excited states with increasing pressure. The optical transitions associated with the hyperfine fine structure of the dopant atoms are interpreted using our theoretical framework, which reproduces existing experimental data at zero strain. We show that the hyperfine levels are weakly dependent on magnetic field, and increasing pressure leads to optical transitions at longer wavelengths. Finally, we estimate the spin coherence times of the G4V centers under increasing hydrostatic pressure across different temperature regimes.</p>

            <p>Phonons play a central role in fundamental solid-state phenomena, including superconductivity, Raman scattering, and symmetry-breaking phases. Harnessing phonons to control these effects and enable quantum technologies is therefore of great interest. However, most existing phonon control strategies rely on external driving fields or anharmonic interactions, limiting their applicability. Here, we realize multimode ultrastrong light--matter coupling and theoretically show the modulation of phonon emission. This regime is realized by coupling two optical phonon modes in lead halide perovskites to a nanoslot array functioning as a single-mode cavity. The small mode volume of the nanoslots enables high coupling strengths in the phonon-polariton system. We show theoretically that the nanoslot resonator mediates an effective interaction between phonon modes, leading to superthermal phonon bunching in thermal equilibrium between distinct modes. Our findings are well described by a multimode Hopfield model. This work establishes a pathway for engineering phononic properties for light-harvesting and light-emitting technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: Tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime; an asymptotic law for the jump time is established in high-amplitude bistability. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</p>

            <h2>Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grace M. Sommers, David A. Huse, Michael J. Gullans</p>
            <p>We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</p>

            <p>We report the fabrication and optical characterization of an air-suspended photonic crystal nanobeam cavity in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) realized by focused-ion-beam milling. YIG's combination of low optical loss and ferrimagnetism makes it highly attractive for quantum technologies, yet prior work has largely been focused on millimeter-scale spheres and simple microstructures, hindering true on-chip integration. Demonstrating nanometer-scale patterning in a suspended geometry therefore represents an important advance. Finite-element simulations predict that the same structure supports a flapping-type mechanical mode at $\Omega / 2\pi \approx 1.52 \,\text{GHz}$ and a backward-volume spin-wave mode at $\Omega / 2\pi = 11.59 \,\text{GHz}$ under an in-plane bias field. Although we measure only the photonic resonance (intrinsic $Q \sim 2 \times 10^{3}$) in this study, the device lays the groundwork for future exploration of coupled photon-phonon-magnon dynamics once higher optical quality factors are achieved.</p>

            <h2>Generic Method for Integrating Lindblad Master Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayin Gu, Fan Zhang</p>
            <p>The time evolution of Markovian open quantum systems is governed by Lindblad master equations, whose solution can be formally written as the Lindbladian exponential acting on the initial density matrix. By expanding this Lindbladian exponential into the Taylor series, we propose a generic method for integrating Lindblad master equations. In this method, the series is truncated, retaining a finite number of terms, and the iterative actions of Lindbladian on the density matrix follow the corresponding master equation. Our method offers significant improvements in numerical efficiencies both in memory cost and computation time, especially for systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, our proposed method can be integrated seamlessly with tensor networks. Two illustrative examples, a two-level system exhibiting damped Rabi oscillations and a driven dissipative Heisenberg chain, are used to demonstrate the validity of our method. The superiority of our method is benchmarked with detailed performance tests.</p>

            <h2>State-space kinetic Ising model reveals task-dependent entropy flow in sparsely active nonequilibrium neuronal dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Ishihara, Hideaki Shimazaki</p>
            <p>Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating the steady-state assumption. To overcome these limitations, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for non-stationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization by dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite the reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased coupling-related entropy flow per spike during task engagement, suggesting economical computation in the higher-performing mice. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Gravelle, Cecilia M. S. Alvares, Jacob R. Gissinger, Axel Kohlmeyer</p>
            <p>The availability of open-source molecular simulation software packages allows scientists and engineers to focus on running and analyzing simulations without having to write, parallelize, and validate their own simulation software. While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol. In addition, we introduce LAMMPS-GUI, an enhanced cross-platform graphical text editor specifically designed for use with LAMMPS and able to run LAMMPS directly on the edited input. LAMMPS-GUI is used as the primary tool in the tutorials to edit inputs, run LAMMPS, extract data, and visualize the simulated systems.</p>

            <h2>Bootstrapping the $R$-matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Zhang</p>
            <p>A bootstrap program is presented for algebraically solving the $R$-matrix of a generic integrable quantum spin chain from its Hamiltonian. The Yang-Baxter equation contains an infinite number of seemingly independent constraints on the operator valued coefficients in the expansion of the $R$-matrices with respect to their spectral parameters, with the lowest order one being the Reshetikhin condition. These coefficients can be solved iteratively using Kennedy's inversion formula, which reconstructs the $R$-matrix after an infinite number of steps. For a generic Hamiltonian, the procedure could fail at any step, making the conditions useful as an integrability test. However in all known examples they all turn out to be satisfied whenever the lowest order condition is. It remains to be understood whether they are all implied by the Reshetikhin condition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Chen, Adrian Agreda, Tong Wu, Franck Carcenac, Kevin Vynck, Philippe Lalanne</p>
            <p>Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and, via a statistical quasinormal mode analysis, interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation in semicontinuous metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include colour shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies, for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillermo Serrera, Yoshito Y. Tanaka, Pablo Albella</p>
            <p>Light-matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables independent control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Naji, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, M. Abdi</p>
            <p>We study the effect of noise on the dynamics of the transverse-field Ising model quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the noiseless case, in contrast to the dynamics of entanglement in anisotropic XY chains, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. In contrast, when noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change qualitatively: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with the time scale of a ramp quench, with an exponent determined by the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.</p>

In particular, we demonstrate that a malicious agent with access to only a small subset of nodes can initialize quantum states locally and, through repeated short-time measurements, extract sensitive structural information about the entire network. The intrusion strategy is inspired by extreme learning and quantum reservoir computing and combines short-time quantum evolution with a non-iterative linear readout with trainable weights. These results suggest new strategies for intrusion detection and structural diagnostics in future quantum Internet infrastructures.</p>

            <p>We provide new algorithms and provide example constructions of stabilizer models for the gapped boundaries, domain walls, and $0D$ defects of Abelian composite dimensional twisted quantum doubles. Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</p>

            <p>AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.</p>

We present here a summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer 2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of AI+MPS.</p>

This paper addresses the fundamental problem of checking whether claimed crystals are novel, not noisy perturbations of known materials obtained by unrealistic atomic replacements.

The proposed Lipschitz continuity under noise is a new essential requirement for machine learning on any data objects that have ambiguous representations and live in continuous spaces. For periodic point sets under isometry (any distance-preserving transformation), we designed invariants that distinguish all known counter-examples to the completeness of past descriptors and detect thousands of (near-)duplicates in large high-profile databases of crystals within two days on a modest desktop computer.</p>

            <p>High-throughput materials discovery and studies of complex functional materials increasingly rely on multi-modal characterization performed at synchrotron light sources. However, measurements are typically done with no use of data until after an experiment, neglecting opportunities for data-driven insights to guide measurements. We developed a modular, open-source framework that incorporates artificial intelligence within the Bluesky control and data streaming infrastructure at NSLS-II, enabling real-time orchestration of multi-beamline, multi-modal experiments. AI agents perform on-the-fly reduction, clustering, Gaussian process modelling, and Bayesian optimization driven data acquisition, while users monitor agent behavior and visualize results live. Combinatorial libraries of the ternary Al-Ni-Pt system were spatially mapped by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at the PDF and BMM beamlines, respectively. Dynamic switching between AI-driven and conventional grid mapping strategies was achieved, demonstrating the flexible workflows possible through this framework. A digital twin constructed from a simulated Al-Li-Fe oxide dataset shows that AI-driven mapping strategies outperform conventional mapping as well as random sampling by prioritizing measurements that better resolve both phase boundaries and localized minority phases. This framework supports plug-and-play capabilities, and establishes a foundation for routine multi-modal, AI-assisted large-scale user-facility operations.</p>

Morphogenesis and biological active matter represent keystone problems in biology with additional, far-reaching implications across the biomedical sciences.

Current approaches to simulating anatomical or cellular subsystems tend to rely on static, assumed shapes. Meanwhile, the potential for topology to provide natural dimensionality reduction and organization of shape and dynamical outcomes is not fully exploited. TopoSPAM combines ease of use with powerful simulation algorithms and methodological advances, including active nematic gels, topological-defect-driven shape dynamics, and an active 3D vertex model of tissues.

            <h2>A study of the electronic and ionic structure, for co-existing states of fully and partially ionized hydrogen, using the neutral pseudo-atom method as well as a classical map for the electron subsystem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. W. C. Dharma-wardana</p>
            <p>Prof. Michael Bonitz and his collaborators have made seminal contributions to the study of the uniform electron fluid and the electron-proton fluid, viz., hydrogen, in using {\it ab initio} simulations. These studies provide essential inputs to astrophysics as well as high-energy density physics. This is reflected in the contributions to this festshrift in his honour. The electron-proton system becomes particularly difficult for theoretical modeling when the temperature becomes comparable to the Fermi energy $E_F$, when the warm-dense matter (WDM) state of hydrogen is reached. In this study we briefly review the theoretical methods available for the study of WDM systems, and use the neutral-pseudo atom (NPA) method, and a classical map for quantum electrons to study fully and partially ionized hydrogen. It is shown that {\it both} fully and partially ionized states can independently exist at the {\it same density and temperature} in many cases. Recent studies using path-integral Monte Carlo methods, and $N$-atom Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations have provided essential structure data including the electron-electron structure factor $S_{ee}(k)$ that enters into interpretation of X-ray Thomson scattering and other diagnostics.

            <h2>The Cryogenic Lagrangian Exploration Module: a rotating cryostat for the study of quantum vortices in Helium II via particle seeding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeremy Vessaire, Charles Peretti, Florian Lorin, Emeric Durozoy, Gregory Garde, Panayotis Spathis, Benoit Chabaud, Mathieu Gibert</p>
            <p>The study of quantum vortex dynamics in HeII offers great potential for advancing quantum-fluid models. Bose-Einstein condensates, neutron stars, and even superconductors exhibit quantum vortices, whose interactions are crucial for dissipation in these systems. These vortices have quantized velocity circulation around their cores, which, in HeII, are of atomic size. They have been observed indirectly, through methods such as second sound attenuation or electron bubble imprints on photosensitive materials. Over the past twenty years, decorating cryogenic flows with particles has become a powerful approach to studying these vortices. However, recent particle visualization experiments often face challenges with stability, initial conditions, stationarity, and reproducibility. Moreover, most dynamical analyses are performed in 2D, even though many flows are inherently 3D. We constructed a rotating cryostat with optical ports on an elongated square cupola to enable 2D2C, 2D3C, and 3D3C Lagrangian and Eulerian studies of rotating HeII flow. Using this setup, individual quantum vortices have been tracked with micron-sized particles, as demonstrated by Peretti et al., Sci. Adv. 9, eadh2899 (2023). The cryostat and associated equipment -laser, cameras, sensors, and electronics- float on a 50 {\mu}m air cushion, allowing for precise control of the experiment's physical parameters. The performance during rotation is discussed, along with details on particle injection.</p>

            <h2>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abijith Krishnan, Ajesh Kumar, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</p>

            <h2>Continuum Fractons: Quantization and the Many Body Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ylias Sadki, Abhishodh Prakash, S. L. Sondhi</p>
            <p>We formulate a continuum quantum mechanics for non-relativistic, dipole-conserving fractons. Imposing symmetries and locality results in novel phenomena absent in ordinary quantum mechanical systems. A single fracton has a vanishing Hamiltonian, and thus its spectrum is entirely composed of zero modes. For the two-body problem, the Hamiltonian is perfectly described by Sturm--Liouville (SL) theory. The effective two-body Hamiltonian is an SL operator on $(-1,1)$ whose spectral type is set by the edge behavior of the pair inertia function $K(x)\sim \lvert x -x_\mathrm{edge} \rvert^{\theta}$. We identify a sharp transition at $\theta=2$: for $\theta<2$ the spectrum is discrete and wavepackets reflect from the edges, whereas for $\theta>2$ the spectrum is continuous and wavepackets slow down and, dominantly, squeeze into asymptotically narrow regions at the edges. For three particles, the differential operator corresponding to the Hamiltonian is piecewise defined, requiring several "matching conditions" which cannot be analyzed as easily. We proceed with a lattice regularization that preserves dipole conservation, and implicitly selects a particular continuum Hamiltonian that we analyze numerically. We find a spectral transition in the three-body spectrum, and find evidence for quantum analogs of fracton attractors in both eigenstates and in the time evolution of wavepackets. We provide intuition for these results which suggests that the lack of ergodicity of classical continuum fractons will survive their quantization for large systems.</p>

            <p>The intricate competition between coexisting charge density waves (CDWs) can lead to rich phenomena, offering unique opportunities for phase manipulation through electromagnetic stimuli. Leveraging time-resolved X-ray diffraction, we demonstrate ultrafast control of a CDW in EuTe$_4$ upon optical excitation. At low excitation intensities, the amplitude of one of the coexisting CDW orders increases at the expense of the competing CDW, whereas at high intensities, it exhibits a nonmonotonic temporal evolution characterized by both enhancement and reduction. This transient bidirectional controllability, tunable by adjusting photo-excitation intensity, arises from the interplay between optical quenching and phase-competition-induced enhancement. Our findings, supported by phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory simulations, not only clarify the relationship between the two CDWs in EuTe$_4$, but also highlight the versatility of optical control over order parameters enabled by phase competition.</p>

            <h2>Excitons and Optical Response in Excitonic Insulator Candidate TiSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dino Novko</p>
            <p>The origin of the charge density wave (CDW) phase in TiSe$_2$ is a highly debated topic, with lattice and excitonic correlations proposed as the main driving mechanisms. One of the proposed scenarios is the excitonic insulator (EI) mechanism, where soft electronic mode drives the phase transition. However, the existence of this purely electronic mode is controversial. Here, we perform fully ab-initio calculations of the electron excitation spectra in TiSe$_2$ with electron-hole excitonic effects included via Bethe-Salpeter equations. In the normal high-temperature phase the excitation spectra is dominated by the exciton mode at 1.6 eV, while no well-defined soft electronic modes that could support the EI phase are present. In the CDW phase, the structural distortions induce a CDW band-gap opening between Ti-$d$ and Se-$p$ states, which supports the formation of the two low-energy excitonic modes in the optical spectrum at 0.4 eV and 80 meV. Close to the transition temperature $T_{\rm CDW}$, these two excitonic modes are softened and approach zero energy. These results suggest that the EI mechanism is not a main driving force in the formation of the CDW phase in TiSe$_2$, but there is a region in the phase diagram near $T_{\rm CDW}$ where EI fluctuations could be relevant.</p>

            <h2>Large superconducting diode effect driven by edge states in twisted iron-chalcogenide Josephson junctions</h2>

            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE)-the unidirectional, dissipationless flow of supercurrent-is a critical element for future superconducting electronics. Achieving high efficiency under zero magnetic field is a key requirement. The Josephson junction constitutes a versatile SDE platform for exploiting quantum materials that exhibit ferromagnetism, topology, or unconventional superconductivity. However, a single two-dimensional material system that inherently offers these properties and allows for precise interface engineering, such as twisting, remains elusive. Here we report a record-high, field-free diode efficiency of ~30% in twist van der Waals Josephson heterostructures of the sign-change iron-chalcogenide superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45 and the conventional transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductor 2H-NbSe2. The diode response shows a striking twist-angle dependence: the efficiency peaks at crystallographic alignment and collapses with a small misorientation of ~7 deg. Importantly, the twist-angle evolution of superconducting interference measurements reveals that efficient nonreciprocity arises from asymmetric edge supercurrents, whereas bulk transport suppresses the effect. These findings establish edge states as the driving mechanism of the unconventional SDE, linking it to exotic pairing and topology in multiband iron-based superconductors. Our findings reveal intricate physics involving novel pairing symmetry, magnetism, and topology in the multiband iron-based superconductor, and offer a new route to high-performance superconducting diodes.</p>

            <p>Strong-field terahertz (THz) excitations enable dynamic control over electronic, lattice and symmetry degrees of freedom in quantum materials. Here, we uncover pronounced terahertz-induced symmetry modulations and coherent phonon dynamics in the van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPS3, in which inversion symmetry is broken by its antiferromagnetic spin configuration. Time-resolved second harmonic generation measurements reveal long-lived giant oscillations in the antiferromagnetic phase, with amplitudes comparable to the equilibrium signal, driven by phonons involving percent-level atomic displacements relative to the equilibrium bond lengths. The temporal evolution of the rotational anisotropy patterns indicate a dynamic breaking of mirror symmetry, modulated by two vibrational modes at 1.7 THz and 4.5 THz, with the former corresponding to a hidden mode not observed in equilibrium spectroscopy. We show that these effects arise in part from a field-induced charge rearrangement mechanism that lowers the local crystal symmetry, and couples to the phonon modes. A long-lived field-driven response was uncovered with a complex THz polarization dependence which, in comparison to theory, indicates evidence for an antiferromagnetic-to-ferrimagnetic transition. Our results establish an effective field-tunable pathway for driving excitations otherwise weak in equilibrium, and for manipulating magnetism in low-dimensional materials via dynamical modulation of symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of Stoner Ferromagnetism by Intrinsic Altermagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Lu, Chao Cao, Huiqiu Yuan, Piers Coleman, Lun-Hui Hu</p>
            <p>The Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism arises from interaction-driven asymmetric filling of spin bands, requiring that the spin susceptibility: (i) peaks dominantly at $\mathbf{Q}=\bm{0}$; and (ii) diverges at a critical interaction strength. Here, we demonstrate that this Stoner mechanism breaks down due to competition with altermagnetic orders, even when both conditions are met. Altermagnetism in solids is characterized by collinear antiparallel spin alignment that preserves translational symmetry, and inherently fulfills these requirements. As a proof of concept, we study a two-orbital Hubbard model with electron filling near Van Hove singularities at high-symmetry momenta. Our results reveal that orbital-resolved spin fluctuations, amplified by strong inter-orbital hopping, stabilize intrinsic altermagnetic order. A quantum phase transition from altermagnetism to ferromagnetism occurs at critical Hund's coupling $J_H$. We further propose directional spin conductivity anisotropy as a detectable signature of this transition via non-local spin transport. This work establishes the pivotal role of altermagnetism in correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Active particles affect their environment as much as the environment affects their active motion. Here, we present an experimental system where both can be simultaneously adjusted in situ using an external AC electric field. The environment consists in a two-dimensional bath of colloidal silica particles, whereas the active particles are gold-coated Janus spheres. As the electric field orthogonal to the planar layer increases, the former become stiffer and the latter become faster. The active motion evolves from a viscous like to a viscoelastic like behavior, with the reorientation frequency increasing with the particle speed. This effect culminates in the spontaneous chiralization of particle trajectories. We demonstrate that self-sustained reorientations arise from local compressions and in- teraction asymmetries, revealing a general particle-level mechanism where changes in the mechanical properties of the environment reshape active trajectories.</p>

As the impurity-bath coupling increases, the excited states change from distinct soliton configurations to hybridized soliton-polaron states, eventually crossing over from repulsive to attractive polarons at unitarity. We identify a universal regime near this crossover where the polaron properties are accurately characterized by the zero-energy scattering length.</p>

            <p>Unveiling the interplay between spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW) orders in correlated electron materials is important to obtain a comprehensive understanding of their electronic, structural, and magnetic properties. Kagome lattice materials are interesting because their flat electronic bands, Dirac points, and van Hove singularities can enable a variety of exotic electronic and magnetic phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe, which exhibits a CDW order deep within an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, was found to respond dramatically to post-growth annealing - with the ability to tune the CDW repeatedly from long-range order to no (or extremely weak) order. Additionally, neutron scattering studies suggest that incommensurate magnetic peaks that onsets at $T_{Canting}$ = $T_{SDW} \approx$ 60 K in the system arise from a SDW order instead of the AFM double cone structure. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to show two distinct spin excitations exist below $T_{Canting}$ corresponding to two coexisting magnetic orders in the system in both sets of annealed samples with and without CDW. While CDW order or no order can dramatically affect the onset temperature of $T_{Canting}$ and elastic incommensurate magnetic scattering, its impact on low-energy spin fluctuations is more limited. In both samples, a pair of gapless incommensurate spin excitations arising from the SDW order wavevector coexist with gapped commensurate spin waves from the A-type AFM order across $T_{Canting}$. Low-energy spin excitations for both samples couple dynamically to the lattice through enhanced magnetic scattering intensity on cooling below $T_{CDW}$, regardless the status of the static long-range CDW order. The incommensurate SDW order in the long-range CDW ordered sample also induces a tiny in-plane lattice distortion of the kagome lattice that is absent in the no CDW ordered sample.</p>

            <h2>Depinning of KPZ Interfaces in Fractional Brownian Landscapes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neda Valizadeh, Morteza Nattagh Najafi</p>
            <p>We explore the critical dynamics of driven interfaces propagating through a two dimensional disordered medium with long range spatial correlations, modeled using fractional Brownian motion. Departing from conventional models with uncorrelated disorder, we introduce quenched noise fields characterized by a tunable Hurst exponent H, allowing systematic control over the spatial structure of the background medium. The interface evolution is governed by a quenched Kardar Parisi Zhang equation modified to account for correlated disorder, namely QKPZ. Through analytical scaling analysis, we uncover how the presence of long-range correlations reshapes the depinning transition, alters the critical force Fc, and gives rise to a family of critical exponents that depend continuously on H. Our findings reveal a rich interplay between disorder correlations and the non-linearity term in QKPZ, leading to a breakdown of conventional universality and the emergence of nontrivial scaling behaviors. The exponents are found to change by H in the anticorrelation regime, while they are nearly constant in the correlation regime, suggesting a super-universal behavior for the latter. By a comparison with the quenched Edwards Wilkinson model, we study the effect of the non linearity term in the QKPZ model. This work provides new insights into the physics of driven systems in complex environments and paves the way for understanding transport in correlated disordered media.</p>

            <p>The Coulomb explosion is a process that occurs following the formation of multiple charges during Auger cascades, leading to the destruction of solid-state and molecular structures. For unstable multi-charged ions produced at Auger cascades, the destruction cross-section is directly related to the probability of Coulomb explosion, which depends on characteristic times of ion dissociation and electron neutralization. This study demonstrates that the atomic dissociation time decreases with charge. An expression for the neutralization time was obtained within the model, in which the probability of Coulomb explosion is considered as a competition of two processes, ion dissociation and electron neutralization. By using approximation of the effective mass, it was shown that the neutralization time is a function of the effective mass and the width of the valence band of solid states.</p>

            <p>Colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots (QD) enable the bottom-up assembly of designer solids. Among the multitudinous applications of QD solids, there has been great success in exploiting the tunable optical properties for LED displays, lighting, bioimaging and diagnostics. Applications dependent on electrical properties such as solar cells, photodetectors, and transistors have fallen short of their full potential because of poor control over electrical properties, and some of applications with the most promise for novelty, such as a solid-state quantum simulator for quantum computation and spintronics, are stagnant. Lack of clarity on the charge transport mechanism has been a significant barrier to progress, particularly as numerous sources of disorder are present. In this work, we make advancements in a nano-patterning technique to fabricate a 70-nm wide QD solid that is also free of several sources of structural defects. Owing to the small size and structural integrity, we isolate the charge dynamics of a single conductance channel within a percolation network. We tune parameters to measure ~10 channels, and with a time-resolved measurement, we find conductance noise that exceeds 100% of the average current. From observation of the long-time dynamics of the charge transport, including random telegraph noise, colored noise and attractor states, we model the transport with stochastic quasi-one-dimensional percolation paths. With this insight into the charge transport of QD solids unimpeded by structural defects, we provide a path for the rational design of a QD solid with electrical properties that reflect the underlying tunable, periodic potential.</p>

            <p>Graph states are entangled states that are essential for quantum information processing, including measurement-based quantum computation. As experimental advances enable the realization of large-scale graph states, efficient fidelity estimation methods are crucial for assessing their robustness against noise. However, calculations of exact fidelity become intractable for large systems due to the exponential growth in the number of stabilizers. In this work, we show that the fidelity between any ideal graph state and its noisy counterpart under IID Pauli noise can be mapped to the partition function of a classical spin system, enabling efficient computation via statistical mechanical techniques, including transfer matrix methods and Monte Carlo simulations. Using this approach, we analyze the fidelity for regular graph states under depolarizing noise and uncover the emergence of phase transitions in fidelity between the pure-state regime and the noise-dominated regime governed by both the connectivity (degree) and spatial dimensionality of the graph state. Specifically, in 2D, phase transitions occur only when the degree satisfies $d\ge 6$, while in 3D they already appear at $d\ge 5$. However, for graph states with excessively high degree, such as fully connected graphs, the phase transition disappears, suggesting that extreme connectivity suppresses critical behavior. These findings reveal that robustness of graph states against noise is determined by their connectivity and spatial dimensionality. Graph states with lower degree and/or dimensionality, which exhibit a smooth crossover rather than a sharp transition, demonstrate greater robustness, while highly connected or higher-dimensional graph states are more fragile. Extreme connectivity, as the fully connected graph state possesses, restores robustness.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Distillation of Magic States via Composite Schemes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Erew, Moshe Goldstein, Yaron Oz, Haim Suchowski</p>
            <p>Magic state distillation (MSD) is a cornerstone of fault-tolerant quantum computing, enabling non-Clifford gates via state injection into stabilizer circuits. However, the substantial overhead of current MSD protocols remains a major obstacle to scalable implementations. We propose a general framework for pre-distillation, based on composite pulse sequences that suppress systematic errors in the generation of magic states. Unlike typical composite designs that target simple gates such as $X$, $Z$, or Hadamard, our schemes directly implement the non-Clifford $\mathcal{T}$ gate with enhanced robustness. We develop composite sequences tailored to the dominant control imperfections in superconducting, trapped-ion, neutral-atom, and integrated photonic platforms. To quantify improvement in the implementation, we introduce an operationally motivated fidelity measure specifically tailored to the $\mathcal{T}$ gate: the T-magic error, which captures the gate's effectiveness in preparing high-fidelity magic states. We further show that the error in the channel arising from the injection of faulty magic states scales linearly with the leading-order error of the states. Across all platforms, our approach yields high-fidelity $\mathcal{T}$ gates with reduced noise, lowering the number of distillation levels by up to three. This translates to exponential savings in qubit overhead and offers a practical path toward more resource-efficient universal quantum computation.</p>

For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix to the projection onto the normalized order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</p>

            <p>Reliable parameter identification in ductile damage models remains challenging because the salient physics of damage progression are localized to small regions in material responses, and their signatures are often diluted in specimen-level measurements. Here, we propose a sequential Bayesian Inference (BI) framework for the calibration of the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) model using multimodal experimental data (i.e., the specimen-level force-displacement (F-D) measurements and the spatially resolved digital image correlation (DIC) strain fields). This calibration approach builds on a previously developed two-step BI framework that first establishes a low-computational-cost emulator for a physics-based simulator (here, a finite element model incorporating the GTN material model) and then uses the experimental data to sample posteriors for the material model parameters using the Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (T-MCMC). A central challenge to the successful application of this BI framework to the present problem arises from the high-dimensional representations needed to capture the salient features embedded in the F-D curves and the DIC fields. In this paper, it is demonstrated that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provides low-dimensional representations that make it possible to apply the BI framework to the problem. Most importantly, it is shown that the sequence in which the BI is applied has a dramatic influence on the results obtained. Specifically, it is observed that applying BI first on F-D curves and subsequently on the DIC fields produces improved estimates of the GTN parameters. Possible causes for these observations are discussed in this paper, using AA6111 aluminum alloy as a case study.</p>

            <p>The resistance of a heavy metal can be modulated by an adjacent magnetic material through the combined effects of the spin Hall effect, inverse spin Hall effect, and dissipation of the spin accumulation at the interface. This phenomenon is known as the spin Hall magnetoresistance. The dissipation of the spin accumulation can occur via various mechanisms, with spin-transfer torque being the most extensively studied. In this work, we report the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance at the interface between platinum and an insulating altermagnetic candidate, Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$. Our findings reveal that this heterostructure exhibits a relatively large spin Hall magnetoresistance signal, which is anisotropic with respect to the crystal orientation of the current channel. We explore and rule out several potential explanations for this anisotropy and propose that our results may be understood in the context of the anisotropies of the spin current channels across the Pt/altermagnetic Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$ interface.</p>

            <p>Applying angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we present compelling spectroscopic evidence demonstrating the intertwining and mutual interaction between the Kondo and kagome sublattices in heavy-fermion intermetallic compound YbV$_6$Sn$_6$. We reveal the Yb 4$f$-derived states near the Fermi level, along with the presence of bulk kagome bands and topological surface states. We unveil strong interactions between the 4$f$ and itinerant electrons, where the kagome bands hosting the Dirac fermions and van Hove singularities predominate. Such findings are well described using a $c$-$f$ hybridization model. On the other hand, our systematic characterization of magnetic properties demonstrates an unusually enhanced antiferromagnetic ordering, where the kagome-derived van Hove singularities near $E_F$ play a vital role in determining the unconventional nature of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction and Kondo coupling. These unique kagome-state-mediated exchange interactions have never been reported before and could lead to a novel phase diagram and various quantum critical behaviors in YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and its siblings. Our results not only expand the family of exotic quantum phases entangled with kagome structure to the strongly correlated regime, but also establish YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ as an unprecedented platform to explore unconventional many-body physics beyond the standard Kondo picture.</p>

            <p>Polar metals are an underexplored material class combining two properties that are typically incompatible, namely a polar crystal structure and reasonable electrical conductivity. While intriguing given that metals favor centrosymmetry, these materials also exhibit potential functional properties relevant to memory, optoelectronic, catalytic, and other applications. The distortive polar metal (DPM) subclass forms through a centrosymmetry-lifting phase transformation into a polar crystal structure. In the process, domains with uniform geometric polar directions form, oftentimes separated by domain boundaries with polarity discontinuities arranged in "charged" head-to-head (H-H) or tail-to-tail (T-T) morphologies. To date, only metallic oxide DPM microstructures have been studied. Here we reveal in the intermetallic DPM Mn5Al8 different chemical reactivity and surface interactions at domain boundaries depending on their H-H or T-T character. Variable surface electron-transfer reactivity suggests localized changes in electronic work functions due to an increase (H-H) or depletion (T-T) in the electronic density of states. This behavior is unintuitive in a metal where electrostatic de-polarizing fields should not account for fluctuations in carrier densities. These findings suggest that metallic DPMs may offer functionalizable domain boundary behavior and deserve increased attention. Metallic DPMs allow highly tunable chemistries that can undergo various thermomechanical processing and transformation protocols. Ultimately, this study marks a milestone in metal physics and uncovers novel intermetallic properties, propelling the discovery and design of advanced electronic materials and devices.</p>

            <h2>Discovery of oxide Li-conducting electrolytes in uncharted chemical space via topology-constrained crystal structure prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungwoo Hwang, Jiho Lee, Seungwu Han, Youngho Kang, Sungwoo Kang</p>
            <p>Oxide Li-conducting solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer excellent chemical and thermal stability but typically exhibit lower ionic conductivity than sulfides and chlorides. This motivates the search for new oxide materials with enhanced conductivity. Crystal structure prediction is a powerful approach for identifying such candidates. However, the structural complexity of oxide SSEs, often involving unit cells with more than 100 atoms, presents significant challenges for conventional methods. In this study, we introduce TOPIC, a structure prediction algorithm that reduces configurational complexity by enforcing corner-sharing (CS) bond topology constraints. We demonstrate that TOPIC successfully reproduces the ground-state and metastable structures of known oxide SSEs, including LiTa$_2$PO$_8$ and Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$, which contain up to about 200 atoms per unit cell. By combining this approach with a pretrained machine-learning interatomic potential, we systematically screen quaternary oxide compositions and identify 92 promising candidates with CS frameworks. In particular, Li$_4$Hf$_2$Si$_3$O$_{12}$, which corresponds to the ground state at its composition, exhibits an ionic conductivity of 14 mS cm$^{-1}$, a hull energy of 21 meV atom$^{-1}$, and a band gap of 6.5 eV. Through our investigation, we identify the Li ratio as one of the key factors determining the stability of CS structures. Overall, our approach provides a practical and scalable pathway for discovering high-performance oxide solid electrolytes in previously unexplored chemical spaces.</p>

            <p>Magnetically levitated spinning rotors are key elements in important technologies such as navigation by gyroscopes, energy storage by flywheels, ultra-high vacuum generation by turbomolecular pumps, and pressure sensing for process control. However, mechanical rotors are typically macroscopic and limited to room temperature and low rotation frequencies. In particular, sensing pressure at low temperatures remains a technological challenge, while emerging quantum technologies demand a precise evaluation of pressure conditions at low temperatures to cope with quantum-spoiling decoherence. To close this gap, we demonstrate wide range pressure sensing by a spinning rotor based on a micromagnet levitated by the Meissner effect at 4.2 Kelvin. We achieve rotational speeds of up to 138 million rotations per minute, resulting in very high effective quality factors, outperforming current platforms. Beside sensing applications, we envision the use of levitated rotors for probing fundamental science including quantum mechanics and gravity, enabled by ultralow torque noise.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Todor M. Mishonov, Albert M. Varonov, Kaloian D. Lozanov</p>
            <p>Over twenty years ago Alexei Abrikosov [A.A. Abrikosov, Metal-insulator transition in layered cuprates (SDW model), Physica C: Supercond. Vol. 391, 2, 147-159 (2003)] considered the Spin-Density-Waves (SDW) model for the metal-insulator transition in layered cuprates. In one of those cuprates, YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$, there are one-dimensional (1D) CuO chains of copper and oxygen ions. In the present work we consider the metal-insulator transition in the model case of a 1D CuO chain in the regime of half-filling of the band. Our model is essentially the same, but as an exchange interaction causing the metal-insulator transition, we consider Kondo-Zener two-electron exchange, which successfully describes many of the electronic properties of the layered cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Strong-coupling superconductivity near Gross-Neveu quantum criticality in Dirac systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veronika C. Stangier, Daniel E. Sheehy, JÃ¶rg Schmalian</p>
            <p>We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.</p>

            <h2>Design Principles for Topological Thermoelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brian Skinner, Poulomi Chakraborty, Joshua Scales, Joseph P. Heremans</p>
            <p>Conventional metals, insulators, and semimetals are constrained by fundamental limitations in terms of their thermoelectric performance. Topological materials offer certain features that allow them to circumvent these constraints, and potentially to form the basis for thermoelectric devices with unprecedented efficiency. In this article we review the thermoelectric performance of topological materials, focusing specifically on nodal semimetals, such as Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. We discuss how certain unique ``topological'' features of these materials -- namely their topologically protected band touching points, electron-hole degenerate lowest Landau level, and Berry curvature -- allow them to exhibit thermoelectric properties that go beyond what is possible in conventional materials, particularly in the presence of an applied magnetic field. We focus our discussion on the goal of achieving large figure of merit $zT$, and for each material class we summarize optimal \emph{design principles} for selecting materials that maximize thermoelectric efficiency. We then use these optimal design principles to design and implement a high-throughput database search for topological semimetals that are promising as thermoelectrics. In addition to highlighting a number of materials that are already known to have large magnetothermoelectric effects, our search uncovers twelve additional materials that are especially promising for near-future experiments.</p>

            <h2>Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksandr Hryhorenko, Anne-Marie Valente-Feliciano, Eric M. Lechner</p>
            <p>Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.</p>

            <h2>Spin and Orbital Edelstein effect in gated monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tapesh Gautam, S. Satpathy</p>
            <p>The Edelstein effect consists of the non-equilibrium accumulation of magnetization in response to an applied electric field in systems with broken inversion symmetry. While the spin Edelstein effect (SEE), originating from spin moments, is well established, its orbital counterpart, where magnetization arises from orbital moment, has only recently begun to attract attention. In this work, we investigate the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) in gated monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, by using first-principles density-functional calculations with both electron and hole doping. The gate-induced broken mirror symmetry produces a Rashba-type chiral spin/orbital angular momentum texture, which in turn leads to the Edelstein effect in response to an applied in-plane electric field. We find that for electron doping the Edelstein response is dominated by the orbital channel, whereas for hole doping the orbital and spin contributions are comparable. For the case of hole doping, both OEE and SEE are strongly enhanced by a small amount of strain, due to strain-driven shifts between the Gamma and K/K' valley energies. We derive analytical expressions for the spin and orbital Edelstein susceptibilities and evaluate their magnitudes from first-principles. Remarkably, the predicted OEE in gated monolayer TMDs is an order of magnitude larger than values reported in previously studied systems. Our results identify TMDs as promising platforms for studying the orbital Edelstein effect and highlight their potential applications in spintronics devices.</p>

            <p>The orbital degree of freedom has recently attracted significant attention due to the novel phenomena it enables in condensed matter systems. However, the interpretation of the orbital degree of freedom in bosonic quasiparticles remains conceptually ambiguous and the mechanisms governing the transfer of orbital angular moment (OAM) between distinct quasiparticles, such as magnons and phonons, are not yet fully understood. We investigate orbital dynamics in bosonic systems and identify two origins of OAM: (i) global rotational motion of the system, and (ii) the quantum geometry of wavefunctions. Focusing on the latter, we study strongly coupled magnon-phonon systems in two-dimensional antiferromagnets as a test case. We uncover finite OAM arising from quantum geometric effects via two mechanisms: (a) time-parity symmetry breaking, yielding intra band OAM, and (b) interband coupling, generating interband OAM. We propose that an electrical detection scheme based on the transverse voltage generated by hybrid magnon phonon modes can be used to experimentally probe the bosonic orbital degree of freedom. Our results establish a foundation for the emerging field of phonon orbitronics, providing both a conceptual bridge between phonon and magnon orbitronics and a tool for better understanding magnon-polarons. They also advance a unified framework for harnessing orbital degrees of freedom in bosonic systems and pave the way toward electrical control of magnetization and phononic transport.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaqing Yang, Zhen Zhang, Liwen Zhang, Liantuan Xiao, Suotang Jia, Jun Chen, Lei Zhang</p>
            <p>The electrical control of pure spin current remains a central challenge in spintronics, particularly in time-reversal symmetric systems composed of nonmagnetic elements, where spin and electric fields interact only indirectly. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for electrically tuning pure spin photocurrent in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry via a gate electric field. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that in systems with spin-orbit coupling and in-plane mirror symmetry, an out-of-plane electric field induces spin splitting and reversal in the band structure near the Fermi energy, enabling magnitude control and direction reversal of the pure spin photocurrent. To validate this mechanism, we perform first-principles calculations on germanene, an experimentally realized two-dimensional material. Beyond amplitude modulation, we reveal that reversing the direction of the applied electric field leads to a corresponding reversal of the pure spin photocurrent. Furthermore, we show that the pure spin photocurrent can be tuned by varying the photon energy and the incident angle of light, providing additional degrees of control over spin transport. These findings establish a robust strategy for electric-field-controlled pure spin transport in two-dimensional materials, offering new possibilities for the development of optospintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling-Feng Zhang, Wing Chi Yu</p>
            <p>We study the quantum entanglement and quantum phase transition of the non-Hermitian anisotropic spin-1/2 XY model and XXZ model with the staggered imaginary field by analytical methods and numerical exact diagonalization, respectively. Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity, mutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and self-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal entanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be capable of detecting the first-order and $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ model, as well as the Ising and $\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In addition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed through concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably, the critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional points as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases. Furthermore, we find that the first-order transition survives up to a higher non-Hermiticity strength compared to the BKT transition within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime of the XXZ model.</p>

Using classical-field (truncated-Wigner) simulations together with a Bogoliubov stability analysis, we show that the dark-state nature of the soliton suppresses fluctuations and shifts the critical point relative to the comparable phenomenon of optical bistability in driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. We then demonstrate that this mechanism quantitatively captures the bistability phase boundary observed in the experiment of R. Labouvie et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 235302 (2016)], resolving substantial discrepancies in prior modeling efforts. Our results reveal how driving, dissipation and quantum coherence can interact to induce nonequilibrium phase transitions in ultra-cold atomic gases.</p>

            <p>The pursuit of topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems has unveiled new physics beyond the conventional Hermitian paradigm, yet their realization in interacting many-body platforms remains a critical challenge. Exploring this interplay is essential to understand how strong interactions and dissipation collectively shape topological phases in open quantum systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate non-Hermitian spectra topology in a dissipative Rydberg atomic gas and characterize parameters-dependent winding numbers. By increasing the interaction strength, the system evolves from Hermitian to non-Hermitian regime, accompanying emergence of trajectory loop in the complex energy plane. As the scanning time is varied, the spectra topology becomes twisted in the complex energy plane manifesting as a topology phase transition with the sign winding number changed. When preparing the system in different initial states, we can access a nontrivial fractional phase within a parameter space that globally possesses an integer winding. Furthermore, by changing the scanning direction, we observe the differentiated loops, revealing the breaking of chirality symmetry. This work establishes cold Rydberg gases as a versatile platform for exploring the rich interplay between non-Hermitian topology, strong interactions, and dissipative quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>The cuprates exhibit anomalous momentum-space structure with antinodal gap and nodal arc in the underdoped regime, which evolves into a complete hole-type Fermi surface with a large Luttinger volume in the overdoped regime. The real-space electronic structure is also quite complex, as characterized by microscopic inhomogeneities and intertwined density wave orders. Here we show that doped holes in cuprate form localized electronic molecules consisting of 4a0 plaquettes, and each plaquette contains approximately two holes. The effective local doping level is thus around 1/8, which is sufficient to destroy the underlying AF order and more importantly, recovers the half-filled metallic state of the original CuO2 plane. The restored Fermi surface, hosting one hole per unit cell, is consistent with experimental results and satisfies the Luttinger theorem. We then construct the momentum-space structure of the half-filled metal by considering the real-space configuration of electronic molecules. We show that the electronic potential with 4a0 periodicity imposed by the plaquettes and the quantum size effect of electronic molecules obliterate the nested antinodal Fermi surface sheets, leaving behind short arcs with coherent quasiparticles around the node. We propose that two doped holes in each plaquette occupy the shared molecular orbital and form a spin singlet, which can mediate the pairing of itinerant holes on the remnant Fermi surface of the half-filled metal. The electric dipole moment between the molecular orbitals and the dopant ions may also provide a novel attractive interaction between itinerant holes. This phenomenological model for pair formation between itinerant holes on the half-filled Fermi surface mediated by localized molecular orbitals resolves several core issues concerning the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets, which encompass a broad landscape of materials, are compensated collinear magnetic phases in which the antiparallel magnetic moments are related by a crystalline rotation. Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity has been demonstrated in the family of multi-layered nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Key questions remain open regarding the low-energy electronic states that support superconductivity in these compounds. Here we take advantage of the natural polymorphism between bilayer (2222) and alternating monolayer-trilayer (1313) stacking sequences that arises in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ crystals, and by employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we identify a universal low-energy electronic structure in this family of materials. We observe the fingerprint of a doping-dependent spin-density wave (SDW) instability -- strong and coherent enough to reconstruct the Fermi surface, both by gapping out regions of the low-energy electronic structure as well as translating the $\beta$ pocket by a vector $Q_{t\beta}$ consistent with the results of previous neutron and x-ray scattering experiments. Using an effective tight-binding model, we simulate the spectral weight distribution observed in our ARPES dichroism experiments and establish that the low-energy electronic phenomenology is dominated by oxygen-centered planar orbitals, which evolve from the $d_{3x^2-r^2}$ and $d_{3y^2-r^2}$ symmetry characteristic of 3-spin polarons (3SP) to the familiar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Zhang-Rice singlets (ZRS) that support high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. By inclusion of magnetic moments on plaquettes of oxygen orbitals in our model, we show that ZRS-like states mediate the SDW. Combined with the observation that oxygen annealing is required to induce superconductivity in both thin films and bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, this demonstrates that the ZRS population dictates whether the ground state favors density-wave order or superconductivity -- with hole doping suppressing the former and stabilizing the latter, as in the cuprates.</p>

            <p>Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moirÃ© excitons provide a fertile territory for realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moirÃ© excitons hybridize with photons to form moirÃ© exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features. In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moirÃ© excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moirÃ© patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moirÃ© polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moirÃ© excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.</p>

            <h2>Ferroelectric Control of Interlayer Excitons in 3R-MoS$_{2}$ / MoSe$_{2}$ Heterostructures</h2>

            <p>We investigate the interaction between interlayer excitons and ferroelectric domains in hBN-encapsulated 3R-MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterostructures, combining photoluminescence experiments with density functional theory and many-body Green's function calculations. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals a strong redshift of the interlayer exciton energy with increasing MoS$_2$ layer thickness, attributed to band renormalization and dielectric effects. We observe local variations in exciton energy that correlate with local ferroelectric domain polarization of the 3R-MoS$_2$ layer, showcasing distinct domain-dependent interlayer exciton transition energies. Gate voltage experiments demonstrate that the interlayer exciton energy can be tuned by electrically induced domain switching. These results highlight the potential for interlayer exciton control by local ferroelectric order and establish a foundation for future ferroelectric optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuya Mameda, Naoki Yamamoto</p>
            <p>Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.</p>

            <p>We study experimentally and theoretically optical absorption spectra of neodymium ferroborate in the temperature range $6-32$ K. We show that the temperature dependences of integral intensities of absorption lines demonstrate qualitatively different behavior for $\sigma$- and $\pi$-polarizations of the light. We suggest that this behavior may be caused by the appearance of a spiral magnetic structure in the compound under study. To describe the temperature dependences of lines intensities we propose a theoretical model which takes into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction between Nd$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ ions.</p>

            <p>We report high-precision resistance measurements on quantum Hall resistance devices fabricated from uniform epitaxial graphene grown by propane-hydrogen chemical vapor deposition on a two-inch silicon carbide substrate. Through molecular doping, we achieve a low carrier density regime ($n_\mathrm s < $ 1.5 \textperiodcentered 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$) combined with high mobility ($\upmu \geq$ 6000 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$) at low temperature. Accurate quantization of the Hall resistance is demonstrated at magnetic flux densities as low as 3.5 T, temperatures up to 8 K, and measurement currents up to 325 $\upmu$A, with relative measurement uncertainties of a few parts per billion. A stability diagram mapping dissipation as a function of temperature and current provides insight into optimal doping conditions that maximize the breakdown current.

            <p>Advanced ab initio materials simulations face growing challenges as increasing systems and phenomena complexity requires higher accuracy, driving up computational demands. Quantum many-body GW methods are state-of-the-art for treating electronic excited states and couplings but often hindered due to the costly numerical complexity. Here, we present innovative implementations of advanced GW methods within the BerkeleyGW package, enabling large-scale simulations on Frontier and Aurora exascale platforms. Our approach demonstrates exceptional versatility for complex heterogeneous systems with up to 17,574 atoms, along with achieving true performance portability across GPU architectures. We demonstrate excellent strong and weak scaling to thousands of nodes, reaching double-precision core-kernel performance of 1.069 ExaFLOP/s on Frontier (9,408 nodes) and 707.52 PetaFLOP/s on Aurora (9,600 nodes), corresponding to 59.45% and 48.79% of peak, respectively.

            <p>Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have long been recognized as promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity by intercalation or charge doping, yet experimental progress has stalled with transition temperatures (Tc) limited to 11.5 K at ambient pressure and 15.1 K at 7.5 GPa in calcium-intercalated graphite over decades. Here, we report robust superconductivity in sodium-intercalated graphite with Tc of 22.3 K, as demonstrated by clear zero-resistance behavior. Our approach involves simply room-temperature grinding of graphite with sodium, followed by slight compression up to 7.1 GPa, circumventing complex synthesis procedures. Through synchrotron X-ray diffraction combined with first-principles calculations, we identify the major superconducting phase as an orthorhombic stage-2 GIC structure with slightly over-stoichiometric composition (Na1+xC8). Electron-phonon coupling calculations reveal that superconductivity primarily emerges from the interactions between out-of-plane carbon electrons and low-frequency Na/C this http URL enhancement in Tc establishes sodium as superior for achieving higher-Tc in GICs and illustrates promising pathway for further optimization through compositional and structural tuning.</p>

            <h2>Splitting of electronic spectrum in paramagnetic phase of itinerant ferromagnets and altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Katanin</p>
            <p>We study self-energy effects, induced by strong magnetic fluctuations in paramagnetic phase of strongly-correlated itinerant magnets within the density functional theory combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT approach) and its non-local extension. As concrete examples, we consider $\alpha$-iron, half metal CrO$_2$, van der Waals material CrTe$_2$, and altermagnet CrSb. We show that both local and non-local magnetic correlations yield splitting of the electronic spectrum in the paramagnetic phase, such that it closely resembles the DFT band structure in the ordered phase and suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The relative importance of non-local vs. local correlations depends on the proximity to half filling of $d$ states: closer to half filling, the role of local correlations increases. Although the obtained split bands do not possess a certain spin projection, their splitting suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The obtained electronic states are also expected to be easily spin polarized by a weak external magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Superconducting diodes, similar to semiconductor diodes, possess unidirectional superconducting properties and are the fundamental units for constructing superconducting quantum computing, thus attracting widespread attention. At present, most of superconducting diodes require an external magnetic field or proximity effect to break time reversal symmetry (TRS). The cases of intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) under zero magnetic field are relatively scarce, and there are still some puzzles especially regarding the reasons for the TRS breaking. Here, we not only report field free SDE in NbSe2 induced by strain, but also large values of the difference of Ic+ and |Ic-| ({\Delta}Ic) of 286 {\mu}A and the superconducting diode efficiency ({\eta}) of 6.76 % are achieved. Interestingly, {\Delta}Ic varies with the magnetic field and exhibits two distinct evolutionary behaviors with B-odd or B-even symmetry in various devices. We attribute this to the selective activation of two independent, spatially-orthogonal mechanisms: a stress-induced real-space polarity and a field-induced reciprocal-space asymmetric energy bands. In general, we propose an extremely effectively method to produce field free SDE, even when the material itself does not possess field free SDE, and provide new perspectives to understand the SDE which build new avenues for superconducting quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Huang, Fatemeh Aghabozorgi, Stephanie Brock</p>
            <p>We report magnetoelectric coupling in nanoparticle assemblies that persists to temperatures over 300 times lower than in previous studies. The ME response saturates at low temperature, revealing a quantum plateau of the coupling. A field dependence analysis shows a crossover from quadratic to linear behavior, captured by a phenomenological expansion $C(B,T) \simeq C_0(T) + a_1(T) B + a_2(T) B^2$. The magnitude of the extracted quadratic coefficient, $|a_2(T)|$, follows a power law $|a_2(T)| \sim T^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 1.15$, indicating proximity to a quantum critical regime. The observed saturation reflects a new intrinsic energy scale, distinct from finite-size or extrinsic effects. These results establish nanoparticle assemblies as a new platform for studying quantum magnetoelectric phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Design of model Boger fluids with systematically controlled viscoelastic properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonghyun Hwang, Howard A. Stone</p>
            <p>The subject of viscoelastic flow phenomena is crucial to many areas of engineering and the physical sciences. Although much of our understanding of viscoelastic flow features stem from carefully designed experiments, preparation of model viscoelastic fluids remains an outstanding challenge; for example, fabricating a series of fluids with varied fluid shear moduli $G_0$, but with an identical relaxation time $\tau$, is nontrivial. In this work, we harness the non-ideality of nearly constant-viscosity elastic fluids (commonly known as `Boger fluids') made with polyisobutylene to develop an experimental methodology that produces a set of fluids with desired viscoelastic properties, specifically, $G_0$, $\tau$, and the first normal stress difference coefficient $\psi_1$. Through a simple linear algebraic manipulation between the rheological properties of interest ($G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$) and the fluid compositions in terms of polymer concentration $c$, molecular weight $M_w$, and solvent viscosity $\eta_s$, we developed a `design equation' that takes $G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$ as inputs and calculates values for $c$, $M_w$, $\eta_s$ as outputs. Using this method, fabrication of sample viscoelastic fluids whose rheological properties are \textit{a priori} known can be achieved.</p>

Structural, energetic, and electronic analyses were used to characterize adsorption on nanotube surfaces. The adsorption energy becomes more favorable as the tube radius increases, consistent with enhanced pi-pi stacking on less curved surfaces. Both CNTs and BNNTs physisorb CLT; however, BNNTs appear more promising for CLT detection and removal in contaminated environments. The tube radius strongly affects the computed electronic and energetic descriptors. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS confirm the stability of CLT adsorbed on CNT and BNNT surfaces in aqueous solution.</p>

            <p>Cu-doped NiO thin films were deposited on ITO substrates via spray pyrolysis at 450 Â°C for 1.5 minutes. XRD confirmed a cubic NiO structure, with Cu incorporation reducing crystallite size, increasing interplanar spacing, and expanding the lattice parameter, indicating successful substitution of Cu ions. Optical analysis showed a slight bandgap reduction from 3.70 to 3.65 eV, while PL revealed lower emission intensity, suggesting enhanced defect states and suppressed carrier recombination. Raman spectroscopy exhibited redshifts in LO, 2TO, and 2LO modes and the disappearance of the TO mode, confirming lattice distortion from Cu doping. Gas sensing tests under ambient and LPG conditions demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity and voltage-dependent response for doped films. These results establish that Cu incorporation enhances charge transport and gas interaction mechanisms, making Cu-doped NiO films highly promising for efficient and reliable gas sensors.</p>

            <p>Chiral-lattice degrees of freedom can offer novel chirality-selective functionalities for thermotronic applications. Chiral phonons, carrying both heat and angular momentum, can emerge through a breaking of chiral degeneracy in the phonon bands, either via an intrinsic chiral crystal structure or by angular momentum transfer from photons or spins. This chiral controllability of the lattice dynamics enables a design of chiral thermo-devices by integrating ferromagnets with chiral materials. Here, we present a nanoscale chirality-selective thermal switch realized using a simple heterostructure composed of ferromagnetic [Co/Pt] multilayers and insulating chiral $\alpha$-SiO2, where an external magnetic field can control thermal transport properties. Our experimental results based on the magneto-optic thermometry reveal that the thermal conductivity of $\alpha$-SiO2 exhibits a clear dependence on both the magnetization direction of [Co/Pt] multilayers and the structural chirality of $\alpha$-SiO2, which is supported well by the first-principles-based molecular dynamic simulations. The magnetization-dependent thermal on/off ratio amounts to 1.07 at room temperature and increases to about 1.2 as temperature decreases to 50 K, due to a reduction of Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering rate in $\alpha$-SiO2. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration of the nanoscale chirality-selective thermal switch based on the ferromagnetic/chiral material heterostructure, highlighting its potential as a key technology for addressing heat dissipation challenges in nanoscale electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Solid-melt interfaces play a pivotal role in governing crystal growth and metal-mediated epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) and other semiconductor materials. Using atomistic simulations based on machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we uncover that multiple layers of Ga atoms at the GaN-Ga melt interface form structurally ordered and electronically charged configurations that are critical for the growth kinetics of GaN. These ordered layers modulate the free energy landscape (FEL) for N adsorption and substantially reduce the migration barriers for N at the interface compared to a clean GaN surface. Leveraging these interfacial energetics, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations reveal that GaN growth follows a diffusion-controlled, layer-by-layer mechanism, with the FEL for N adsorption emerging as the rate-limiting factor. By incorporating facet-specific FELs and the diffusivity/solubility of N in Ga melt, we develop a predictive, fitting-free transport model that estimates facet-dependent growth rates in the range of ~0.01 to 0.04 nm/s, in agreement with experimental growth rates observed in GaN nanoparticles synthesized by Ga-mediated molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). This multiscale framework offers a generalizable and quantitative approach to link atomic-scale ordering and interfacial energetics to macroscopic phenomena, providing actionable insights for the rational design of metal-mediated epitaxial processes.</p>

            <p>Weak localization of bosons can give rise to an exotic quantum phase known as a Bose glass, characterized by the absence of global phase coherence yet finite conductivity. This phase is crucial in understanding the interplay between disorder, interactions, and superconductivity, especially in two-dimensional and strongly correlated systems. Here we report the presence of the Bose glass phase in the weak localization region of ruthenium oxide Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. The electrical resistance exhibits a characteristic logarithmic temperature dependence in this phase, $\rho \sim \ln(1/T)$. Through $\beta$-function scaling analysis, we observed "vertical flow" indicating unconventional scaling behavior associated with localized bosonic states. Our results suggest the existence of bosons-Cooper pairs-persisting up to high temperatures around 220 K and that these bosons undergo weak localization. In the Bose glass phase, vortices are found to have a dual relationship with the localized Cooper pairs, enabling their motion and resulting in finite resistance despite the presence of bosonic order. We identified two quantum critical points: one between the Bose glass and superconducting phases and another between the Bose glass and Mott insulating phases, allowing us to extract the corresponding quantum sheet resistances. We revealed that the ground state of the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ changes depending on the localization strength. Thinning the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ corresponds to controlling the electronic correlation by relieving the distortion in RuO$_6$ octahedra. These findings offer significant insights into the interplay between electronic correlations and bosonic transport, with important implications for studying high-temperature superconductors based on perovskite structures.</p>

            <p>Brownian relaxation is one of the primary mechanisms that allows magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to convert magnetic energy into thermal energy under an excitation magnetic field. Accurately characterizing the MNPs' magnetization dynamics dominated by Brownian relaxation is crucial for achieving high-precision temperature estimation. However, the lack of a readily applicable analytical expression remains a major obstacle to the advancement of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia (MNPH). In this paper, the perturbation method was applied to derive analytical expressions from the Fokker-Planck equation, which characterized MNPs' magnetization behaviors under the AC and DC magnetic fields. Numerical simulations were conducted to validate the accuracy of the analytical expressions and to explore the correlation between temperature and the magnetization response. Then, a temperature analysis model based on magnetization harmonics was constructed. The first and second harmonic ratios and first harmonic phase were used to calculate MNPs' temperature, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that within 310 K to 320 K, the estimation error of the temperature using the amplitude ratio of the first to second harmonics is below 0.0151 K, while the error using the first harmonic phase is below 0.0218 K. The derived analytical expressions are expected to enhance the accuracy of MNP-based temperature measurements and facilitate their broader applications in MNPH and MNP imaging.</p>

            <p>By employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we study an extended checkerboard Hubbard model on the two-leg ladder, which includes an intraplaquette nearest-neighbour attraction V. The simulated results show that V plays a significant role in enhancing the d-wave superconductivity when the electron density is close to half-filling. In the homogeneous case t'=t (t and t' are the intraplaquette and interplaquette hopping integrals), large critical |Vc| is required to induce the superconducting ground state. With decreasing t', |Vc| is substantially diminished and the pair state has a nearly C4 symmetry. In the extremely inhomogeneous case t'<0.2t, the system transits to the d-wave superconducting phase at V\sim-0.3t and V\sim-0.4t for U=8t and U=12t, respectively, accompanying with a shift of spin and single-particle excitations from gapless to gapped type.</p>

            <p>Structural defects in 2D-transition metal dichalcogenides are critical in modulating their optical and electrical behavior. Nevertheless, precise defect control within the monolayer regime poses a significant challenge. Herein, a high-energy (1MeV) electron beam irradiation strategy is harnessed to induce defects in monolayer MoS2. Controlled variation of electron-beam irradiation time tunes the defect density, as reflected by the evolution of defect-mediated photoluminescence characteristics. The optically active defect emission appearing at approx. 200-300meV below the A exciton at 85K exhibits a systematic increase in intensity with prolonged exposure and saturates at higher laser excitation power. Circular polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals strong suppression of valley polarization of the A exciton after irradiation. Complementary x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identifies enhanced Mo-O bonding signatures in MoS2 following irradiation. Kelvin probe force microscopy indicates the transition to p-type doping behaviour. A detailed temperature and power-dependent photoluminescence measurements further elucidate the optical behaviour of these defect states. Density functional theory calculations using these configurations establish that the transition between the conduction band and acceptor states within the bandgap accounts for the defect emission. This work presents a tunable route for defect engineering in monolayer TMDs, enabling controlled tailoring of their structural and optical properties for optoelectronic, electronic and valleytronic applications.</p>

            <p>Interfaces between materials or phases -- whether in condensed matter systems, biological membranes, or catalytic surfaces -- are rich with phenomena that are fundamentally distinct from those present in the bulk. In some cases, interfaces host quasiparticles, such as surface plasmons or Majorana fermions, which can significantly influence the material properties. Here, we investigate a unique 1D interface formed between two monolayer 2D semiconductors, MoSe2, and WSe2, and unambiguously observe a new type of excitonic quasiparticle that resides exclusively at the boundary. Our optical measurements reveal several remarkable properties of this interfacial exciton. First, it possesses an in-plane dipole moment with exceptionally large dipole lengths of 2nm. The emission spectrum reveals narrow discrete states, indicating strong quantum confinement of the center-of-mass motion across the interface. Power-dependent measurements show a sublinear saturation behavior, reflecting interactions between dipolar excitons in this low-dimensional system. Moreover, the exciton displays striking sensitivity to charge carriers due to its dipolar character. Our results introduce a new platform for exploring interacting 1D dipolar bosonic systems with unique quantum properties and open pathways for novel optoelectronic devices, including applications in nonlinear quantum photonics.</p>

Restricted chemical substitution of S atoms by Se in the constituent molecules allows us to modify the electronic properties. This not only decreases the transition temperature but, in addition, alters the phase transition mechanism, resulting in the ground state deviating from the charge-ordered insulator state of the parent compound. Employing infrared optical spectroscopy, we investigate changes in the charge dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the absence of charge ordering in the Se-substituted materials and suggest that the phase transition is instead driven by the localization of the itinerant charge carriers due to strong electron-phonon interactions.</p>

            <h2>Bromine-methanol etching of semiconductor crystals $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ with different selenium concentrations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.V. Naydenov, G.M. Babenko, O.K. Kapustnyk, I.M. Pritula</p>
            <p>The effect of the selenium concentration in the composition of the $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ semiconductor crystals on their etching with a bromine-methanol solution was studied. A thermodynamic model is proposed to describe the degree of etching of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ and $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals. A thermodynamic law is obtained for the first time to describe the change in the etching rate of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals with different selenium concentrations. Experimental dependencies are constructed for etching trajectories and etching rates with 5% bromine-methanol solutions of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystal samples with nominal $x\sim 0.1$ and selenium concentrations of $y=0$, $y=0.02$, $y=0.06$, and $y=0.1$. The average etching rates were 24${\mu }$m/min, 18${\mu }$m/min, 15${\mu }$m/min, and 13${\mu }$m/min. The threshold effect of a strong decrease in the etching rate upon transition from ternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ to quaternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals, associated with hardening of the crystal structure, is identify and theoretically explained. The obtained experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates and will be useful for choosing the optimal regimes of crystal treatment.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium statistics of barrier crossings with competing pathways</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gulzar Ahmad, Sergey Saveliev, Steven P Fitzgerald, Marco G Mazza, Andrew J Archer</p>
            <p>Many biological, chemical, and physical systems are underpinned by stochastic transitions between equilibrium states in a potential energy. Here, we consider such transitions in a minimal model with two possible competing pathways, both starting from a local potential energy minimum and eventually finding the global minimum. There is competition between the distance to travel in state space and the height of the potential energy barriers to be surmounted, for the transition to occur. One pathway has a higher energy barrier to go over, but requires traversing a shorter distance, whereas the other pathway has a lower potential barrier but it is substantially further away in configuration space. The most likely pathway taken depends on the available time for the transition process; when only a relatively short time is available, the most likely path is the one over the higher barrier. We find that upon varying temperature the overall most likely pathway can switch from one to the other. We calculate the statistics of where the barrier crossing occurs and the distribution of times taken to reach the potential minimum. Interestingly, while the configuration space statistics is complex, the time of arrival statistics is rather simple, having an exponential probability density over most of the time range. Taken together, our results show that empirically observed rates in nonequilibrium systems should not be used to infer barrier heights.</p>

            <h2>Synchronization transitions and spike dynamics in a higher-order Kuramoto model with LÃ©vy noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Zhao, JÃ¼rgen Kurths, Norbert Marwan, Yong Xu</p>
            <p>Synchronization in various complex networks is significantly influenced by higher-order interactions combined with non-Gaussian stochastic perturbations, yet their mechanisms remain mainly unclear. In this paper, we systematically investigate the synchronization and spike dynamics in a higher-order Kuramoto model subjected to non-Gaussian LÃ©vy noise. Using the mean order parameter, mean first-passage time, and basin stability, we identify clear boundaries distingusihing synchronization and incoherent states under different stability indexes and scale parameters of LÃ©vy noise. For fixed coupling parameters, synchronization weakens as the stability index decreases, and even completely disappears when the scale parameter exceeds a critical threshold. By varying coupling parameters, we find significant dynamical phenomena including bifurcations and hysteresis. LÃ©vy noise smooths the synchronization transitions and requires stronger coupling compared to Gaussian white noise. Furthermore, we define spikes and systematically investigate their statistical and spectral characteristics. The maximum number of spikes is observed at small scale parameter. A generalized spectral analysis further reveals burst-like structure via an edit distance algorithm. Moreover, a power-law distribution is observed in the large inter-window intervals of spikes, showing great memory effects. These findings deepen the understanding of synchronization and extreme events in complex networks driven by non-Gaussian LÃ©vy noise.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyi Zhang, Yi Li</p>
            <p>We study Josephson couplings in unconventional superconductors from a symmetry-based perspective, extending the Sigrist-Rice formula to broader classes of pairing symmetries and in the presence of junction interface disorder effects. Applying this formalism to granular superconducting rings, we show that single-band chiral superconductors cannot spontaneously trap magnetic flux, which rules out chiral $p$-wave pairing as a candidate for $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd superconductor, given the observation of half quantum flux in recent Little-Parks experiments. Taking into account the full crystalline symmetry and time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting state of $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, we propose that the effective pairing is a triplet helical equal-spin state, enforced by spin-orbit couplings arising from local inversion symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate that granular rings of such helical superconductors can support spontaneous flux trapping, even in the presence of strong junction interface orientation disorder. Our proposal reconciles apparent inconsistencies among different experimental observations and highlights the crucial role of local inversion symmetry breaking in understanding the pairing symmetry in $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd.</p>

            <h2>Cation accumulation drives the preferential partitioning of DNA in an aqueous two-phase system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroki Sakuta, Yuki Akamine, Akari Kamo, Hao Gong, Norikazu Ichihashi, Arash Nikoubashman, Miho Yanagisawa</p>
            <p>Mixtures of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran (Dex) represent a widely used class of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), with applications ranging from the purification of various biomolecules such as nucleic acids to the synthesis of protocells. A key feature underlying these applications is the selective accumulation of biomolecules within Dex-rich droplets in an aqueous PEG phase, but the physical origin of this partitioning remains unclear. Depletion interactions were long assumed to be the primary driving force; however, our systematic experiments using DNA of different lengths indicate that depletion alone cannot fully explain the observed behavior. We identify an additional and previously underappreciated contribution from electrostatic interactions: Dex carries a slightly more negative charge than PEG, which drives preferential cation accumulation in the Dex-rich phase. These counterions facilitate the selective partitioning of DNA inside the Dex-rich droplets. This mechanism explains the dependency of DNA uptake in Dex-rich droplets on polymer length and salt concentration. Our findings establish Donnan-type ion partitioning as a central principle of nucleic acid localization in Dex-rich droplets, offering a unified explanation for this long-standing phenomenon. They lay the foundation for designing ATPS-based systems and help elucidate the physicochemical principles of biomolecular partition upon phase separation in cells.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhan, Huaiyu Zhang, Yu Wang, Baojie Feng, Peng Cheng, Lan Chen</p>
            <p>Magnetic monopoles, hypothetical particles behaving as isolated magnetic charges, have long been predicted by theories beyond the standard model but remain elusive in experimental detection. In this study, we demonstrate a novel method to induce and detect magnetic monopoles on the surface of three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By applying a radially distributed electric field via the STM tip to induce an image magnetic monopole using the topological magnetoelectric (TME) effect, we observe electric field-dependent intrinsic splitting peaks of image potential states (IPS) on the surface of a 3D high-order TI Bi(111). These IPS splitting phenomena originate from the Zeeman effect of the orbital magnetic moments interacting with the magnetic field generated by the magnetic monopoles. Our experimental results, supported by theoretical modeling, successfully demonstrate the detection of magnetic monopole. This work not only deepens our understanding of topological field theory and axion insulators but also opens new avenues for detecting and manipulating magnetic monopoles. The findings suggest that similar studies can be extended to other topological insulator systems, offering potential applications in quantum computing and novel electronic devices.</p>

            <h2>The influence of solute induced memory on interface migration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chad W. Sinclair, JÃ¶rg Rottler</p>
            <p>Interface migration governs microstructural evolution during phase transformations and grain growth thereby dictating those material properties that depend on microstructure. Recent work continues to highlight the rich range of behaviors exhibited by migrating interfaces and the complex connection between these behaviors and the underlying atomistic processes that determine coarse-grained interfacial mobility. For interfaces moving at low homologous temperatures and small driving forces, we show that significant non-Markovian effects can arise that invalidate commonly used analysis methods. Specifically, we demonstrate that solute can act as a source of such non-Markovian motion. In turn, we introduce a time-local (TCL) propagator approach to account for memory-dominated short and intermediate time interface dynamics. This approach extrapolates to the long time diffusive limit, enabling robust mobility estimates from simulation windows far shorter than those required to observe linear scaling directly. Comparison with solute-free boundaries validates the method and quantifies solute drag in the Cahn-Hillert sense, providing a route to extract drag coefficients and effective mobilities across a range of solute concentrations. Our results demonstrate that analysis including memory is essential for connecting atomistic simulations to continuum models and offer a practical framework for studying interface kinetics in systems with slow internal processes.</p>

            <p>The supermoirÃ© lattice, arising from the interference of multiple moirÃ© patterns, dramatically reshapes the electronic band structure by introducing new minibands and modifying band dispersion. Concurrently, strong electronic interactions within moirÃ© flat bands lead to the emergence of various correlated states. However, the impact of the supermoirÃ© lattice on the flat band systems with strong interactions remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the existence of the supermoirÃ© lattice in the mirror-symmetry-broken twisted trilayer graphene, elucidating its role in generating mini-flat bands and mini-Dirac bands. Furthermore, we demonstrate interaction-induced symmetry-broken phases in the supermoirÃ© mini-flat bands alongside the cascade of superconductor-insulator transitions enabled by the supermoirÃ© lattice. Our work shows that robust superconductivity can exist in the mirror-symmetry-broken TTG and underscores the significance of the supermoirÃ© lattice as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the electronic properties in twisted multilayer systems, sheds light on the correlated quantum phases such as superconductivity in the original moirÃ© flat bands, and highlights the potential of using the supermoirÃ© lattice to design and simulate novel quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Magnetoelectric Switching of Competing Magnetic Orders in Rhombohedral Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kilian KrÃ¶tzsch, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Arnaud Magrez, Mitali Banerjee</p>
            <p>A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic ordering. In rhombohedral (RH) stacked graphene, the angular momentum breaking TRS can result from the orbital degree of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in Berry curvature between the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG), achieved without the introduction of a moirÃ© superlattice. At moderate displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This interplay between valley polarization, orbital magnetism, and electric and magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of RHG. Our findings present crystalline RHG as a minimal, tunable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering insight into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric response.</p>

            <h2>Robust Majorana Platform Driven by a Meissner-Induced Anisotropic Doppler Shift</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Hong Pan, Si-Qi Yu, Li Chen, Fu-Chun Zhang, Xin Liu</p>
            <p>The realization of robust Majorana zero modes (MZMs), a cornerstone for fault-tolerant quantum computing, is hindered by the challenge of creating a platform that simultaneously offers a large topological gap, high tunability, and resilience to disorder. A system unifying these properties has remained elusive. Here, we propose and validate a novel platform that harnesses the Meissner effect in a topological insulator (TI) nanowire partially covered by a superconducting (SC) layer. Under an external magnetic field, Meissner screening currents in the SC induce a spatially varying Doppler shift on the TI surface. This effect generates a highly anisotropic effective g-factor, which selectively drives a topological phase transition localized on the nanowire's bottom surface. This mechanism is crucial as it spatially separates the topological phase from the SC/TI interface, permitting strong proximity-induced superconductivity while preventing detrimental band renormalization at the interface from closing the topological gap. Furthermore, by confining the topological superconducting phase to the gate-tunable bottom surface, our platform fully leverages the intrinsic disorder resilience of the TI's topologically protected surface states. Through a combination of supercurrent simulations, self-consistent SchrÃ¶dinger-Poisson calculations, and large-scale tight-binding computations, we validate the platform's robustness. Our work establishes a practical pathway toward Meissner-mediated topological superconductivity for realizing robust MZMs in SC/TI hybrid systems.</p>

            <p>The majority of analysis of interacting systems is done for weak and well-balanced interactions, when in fact topology and rare event factors often result in strong and sign-biased interactions when considering real systems. We analyse the impact of strong mutualistic interactions in a uniformly weighted ErdÅs-RÃ©nyi network under generalised Lotka-Volterra dynamics. In difference to the typical case we show the interaction topology and system dynamics combine to produce power law abundance distributions in a critical region of the phase diagram, identifiable as a Griffiths phase. We find asymptotic expressions for the fixed point solution in this region, and establish the boundary of this region as when topology alone determines the abundance distribution. We show that the Griffiths phase persists for strong mutualistic interactions more generally, and survives when combined with weak all-to-all competition.</p>

            <p>The magnetic spin Hall effect is a time-reversal-odd phenomenon in which spin current is induced by the charge current. In the presence of a spin-orbit coupling and/or noncolinear magnetism, however, spin current is not uniquely defined. Instead, we study an intrinsic response of spin to an electric field gradient that describes the spin accumulation at the boundaries of magnetic systems. We derive a generic formula expressed by Bloch wave functions and apply it to a minimal model for representative altermagnets, RuO$_{2}$ and MnF$_{2}$. Our results show that the intrinsic spin accumulation can be nonzero in magnetic insulators in sharp contrast to the magnetic spin Hall conductivity.</p>

            <p>Metal inorganic-organic complex (MIOC) crystals are a new category of hybrid glass formers. However, the glass-forming compositions of MIOC crystals are limited due to lack of both a general design principle for such compositions and a deep understanding of the structure and formation mechanism for MIOC glasses. This work reports a general approach for synthesizing glass-forming MIOC crystals. In detail, the principle of this approach is based on the creation of hydrogen-bonded structural network by substituting acid anions for imidazole or benzimidazole ligands in the tetrahedral units of zeolitic imidazolate framework crystals. By tuning the metal centers, anions, and organic ligands of MIOCs, supramolecular unit structures can be designed to construct supramolecular networks and thereby enable property modulation. Furthermore, mixed-ligand synthesis yielded a mixed-crystal system in which the glass-transition temperature (Tg) can be linearly tuned from 282 K to 360 K through gradual substitution of benzimidazole for imidazole. Interestingly, upon vitrification, MIOCs were observed to undergo reorganization of hydrogen-bonded networks, with retention of tetrahedral units, short-range disorder, and the freezing of multiple conformations. This work offers a new strategy to systematically expand the glass-forming compositional range of MIOCs and to develop functional MIOC glasses.</p>

The devices consist of twisted high-temperature cuprate superconductors, and exhibit the following distinguished characteristics: (1) a non-reciprocal diode behavior can be simply initiated by current training without applying an external magnetic field; (2) perfect diode efficiency is achieved under microwave irradiations at a record-high working temperature; (3) the quantized nature of the output offers high resilience against input noises.

An electron released from the quantum dot, when driven by an electric field follows a trajectory that is deflected by spin-orbit interaction and undergoes spin precession that results in a spin-dependent, snake-like trajectory. The trajectory strongly depends on the initial state of the electron, enabling detection of the electron quantum state in the dot when connected to the T-junction. Notably, we show that the snake-like trajectory persists even under a small external magnetic field with low, incomplete initial electron spin polarization. Our findings are supported by semiclassical calculations of the electron trajectory, which show good agreement with full quantum mechanical simulations</p>

            <p>Recent advances in nanotechnology have created the need to manufacture three-dimensional nanostructures with controlled material composition. Focused Electron Beam Induced Deposition (FEBID) is a nanoprinting technique offering highest spatial resolution combined with the ability to directly 3D-print almost any shape. It relies on local electron-induced dissociation of metal-ligand organometallic molecules adsorbed onto a substrate. So far FEBID continuum modelling involved the surface kinetics of precursor molecules during electron irradiation and succeeded in the prediction of nanoprint shape and growth rate and forms nowadays the basis of software for 3D nano-printing of nanostructures. Here, we expand the model to the surface kinetics of detached ligands. Involving their dissociation and desorption behavior allows to predict trends in the metallic composition of the nanoprinted material and to define desirable nanoprint process windows as function of electron exposure time and flux. We present the theoretical foundations of the model, validate it experimentally for chromium and silver precursors, compare calculated values with literature data for various precursors, and discuss its potential to design new experiments. This contribution enhances our understanding of FEBID dynamics and provides a versatile framework for predictive FEBID material nano-printing.</p>

            <p>The ability to fabricate anisotropic superconducting layers a la carte is desired in technologies such as fluxon screening or removal in field-resilient devices, flux lensing in ultra-sensitive sensors, or in templates for imprinting magnetic structures in hybrid magnetic/superconducting multilayers. In this work, we demonstrate tailored superconductivity in polycrystalline niobium thin films exposed to femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulses. The samples exhibit significant changes in their superconducting properties, directly connected with the observed topography, crystallite geometry, and lattice parameter modifications. On the mesoscopic scale, quasi-parallel periodic ripple structures (about 260 nm of spatial period) gradually form on the film surface by progressively increasing the laser energy per pulse, Ep. This gives way to a stepwise increase of the critical current anisotropy and magnetic flux channeling effects along the ripples. As demonstrated in our resistive and inductive measurements, these superstructures determine the electromagnetic response of the sample within the regime dominated by flux-pinning. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations corroborate the topographical origin of the customized anisotropy. Concurrently, intrinsic superconducting parameters (critical field and temperature) are moderately and isotropically depressed upon increasing Ep, as is the lattice parameter of Nb. These findings promote pulsed laser processing as a flexible, one-step, and scalable lithography-free technique for versatile surface functionalization in microelectronic superconducting technology.</p>

            <p>We investigate the geometric evolution of elastic domain-wall loops in two dimensions. Assuming an instantaneous, isotropic, and homogeneous arc-velocity response of the domain wall to external pressure and local signed curvature, we derive closed dynamical equations linking the enclosed area and loop perimeter for both linear and nonlinear arc-velocity response functions. This reduced description enables predictions for the dynamics of both spontaneous and externally driven domains-subjected to constant or alternating fields-within the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau scalar $\phi ^4$ model. In the linear response regime, where a non-crossing principle holds in the absence of external driving, we obtain exact results. In particular, we demonstrate that the relaxation rate of the total spontaneous magnetization becomes quantized for arbitrary initial conditions involving multiple, possibly nested, loops, with discrete jumps corresponding to individual loop collapse events. Under external driving, the avoidance principle breaks down due to sparse interactions between interfaces-either within a single loop or between multiple loops-leading to coalescence or splitting events that change the number of loops. A quantized geometrical observable involving the total area and perimeter is identified in this case as well, exhibiting discrete jumps both at interface interaction events and at individual loop collapses. We further use approximate area-perimeter relations to estimate the spontaneous collapse lifetimes of compact magnetic domains, as well as their dynamics under alternating-field-assisted collapse in disordered ultrathin magnetic films. Our predictions are compared with experimental observations in such systems.</p>

Performing extensive hard-particle Monte Carlo simulations at constant volume and employing two protocols, we numerically analyze the collective diffusion and ordering during quenching and the subsequent relaxation to the new equilibrium state. We find that the cascading protocol, which mimics experimentally realized DNA origami, can become dynamically arrested due to the increase in effective packing fraction.</p>

High resolution imaging reveals a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains of finite polarization.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Aguilar, Miguel A. MuÃ±oz, Sandro Azaele</p>
            <p>Robust inference methods are essential for parameter estimation and model selection in stochastic modeling approaches, which provide interpretable frameworks for describing time series of complex phenomena. However, applying such methods is often challenging, as they typically demand either high-frequency observations or access to the model's analytical solution, resources that are rarely available in practice. Here, we address these limitations by designing a novel Monte Carlo method based on full-path statistics and bridge processes, which optimize sampling efforts and performance even under coarse sampling. We systematically investigate how experimental design -- particularly sampling frequency and dataset size -- shapes inference accuracy, revealing optimal sampling regimes and the fundamental limits of model distinguishability. We validate our approach on four datasets -- optical tweezers, human microbiome, topic mentions in social media, and forest population dynamics -- where resolution-dependent limits to inference emerge, offering fresh insight into ongoing debates about the dominant sources of noise in these systems. Overall, this work shows how combining minimal stochastic models with path-inference tools and model selection can guide the experimental design of optimized strategies in data collection and clarify the boundaries of model-based understanding in complex systems.</p>

            <h2>A minimal model of self-organized clusters with phase transitions in ecological communities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shing Yan Li, Mehran Kardar, Zhijie Feng, Washington Taylor</p>
            <p>In complex ecological communities, species may self-organize into clusters or clumps where highly similar species can coexist. The emergence of such species clusters can be captured by the interplay between neutral and niche theories. Based on the generalized Lotka-Volterra model of competition, we propose a minimal model for ecological communities in which the steady states contain self-organized clusters. In this model, species compete only with their neighbors in niche space through a common interaction strength. Unlike many previous theories, this model does not rely on random heterogeneity in interactions. By varying only the interaction strength, we find an exponentially large set of cluster patterns with different sizes and combinations. There are sharp phase transitions into the formation of clusters. There are also multiple phase transitions between different sets of possible cluster patterns, many of which accumulate near a small number of critical points. We analyze such a phase structure using both numerical and analytical methods. In addition, the special case with only nearest neighbor interactions is exactly solvable using the method of transfer matrices from statistical mechanics. We analyze the critical behavior of these systems and make comparisons with existing lattice models.</p>

            <h2>Extrapolation of Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Organic and Polymeric Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Natalie E. Hooven, Arthur Y. Lin, Rose K. Cersonsky</p>
            <p>Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.</p>

            <h2>Two-dimensional THz spectroscopy in electronic systems: a many-body diagrammatic approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo Fiore, NiccolÃ² Sellati, Mattia Udina, Lara Benfatto</p>
            <p>The term two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) usually refers to experimental setups where a coherently generated electric field in a sample is recorded over many runs as a function of two time variables: the delay $\tau$ between two consequent excitation pulses and the time $t$ over which the signal is emitted. While its implementation in the femtosecond time domain for studying vibrational molecular states has been developed for over two decades, its experimental application in the THz domain to interacting electronic systems remains in its infancy. This work provides a general theoretical framework for describing and interpreting 2DCS using a many-body language based on a perturbative diagrammatic expansion, as widely applied in linear spectroscopy. Focusing on centrosymmetric systems, we show that interpreting the 2D maps can be recast into two complementary problems. The first is the evaluation of a third-order response function to the gauge field. In the velocity gauge, this leads to semi-analytical expressions that both reduce computational complexity and assist in assigning spectral features to microscopic processes, as shown using a toy model of electrons undergoing a charge-density wave transition. The second is a careful treatment of multi-wave propagation effects, which, in bulk systems, can obscure the intrinsic nonlinear response, demonstrated here for soft superconducting Josephson plasmons. Our results provide a solid foundation for extending 2DCS to complex interacting systems and offer a flexible method to realistically model nonlinear responses across arbitrary spectral widths.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maggie Liu, Arnold J. T. M. Mathijssen</p>
            <p>The collective motion of microorganisms and microrobots can be used for particle delivery, especially when guided by external magnetic fields, phototaxis, or chemotaxis. This cargo transport is enhanced significantly by hydrodynamic entrainment, where the surrounding fluid and any dissolved molecules or suspended cargo particles are dragged along with a collectively moving swarm. However, it remains unclear how this directed entrainment is affected by stochastic run-tumble motion, and how such motility patterns couple to particle dispersion. Here, we combine theory and simulations to compute the entrainment velocity and diffusivity for different degrees of swimmer directedness. Surprisingly, we find that the transport efficiency PÃ©clet number, the ratio of advective to diffusive transport, is optimal for intermediate directedness values, so perfectly guided active suspensions perform worse than those with stochastic reorientations. These results could have implications for microrobotic drug delivery and nutrient transport in microbial environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Kumar, Amram Azulay, Omer Coriat, Hanna Bishara</p>
            <p>Al-Mg-Si alloys are utilized in large scale electrical conduction applications thanks to their low density, high strength, and low electrical resistivity. The alloying elements, Mg and Si, are introduced to improve the mechanical strength; however, the formed defects also suppress electrical conductivity, adversely affecting the material performance. Here, we investigate the impact of alloying, heat treatment, and the corresponding microstructure, on the electrical resistivity of overaged alloys having 0.5-9.5 at. % solute. The crystal structure, composition, and microstructure are characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The electrical resistivity of the microstructural components, i.e., the Al solid solution matrix and the Si and Mg2Si precipitates, are directly measured using a microscale four-point probe setup inside a scanning electron microscope. We find that the Al solid solution matrix is up to 15 % more resistive than pure Al, depending on the heat treatment rather than the composition, and that regions including Si or Mg2Si precipitates are equally resistive. Additionally, the bulk alloy resistivity, measured conventionally on a macroscopic length scale, increases linearly up to 60 % with increasing total solute concentration up to ~ 10 at. %. This study relates the electrical resistivity of Al-Mg-Si alloys, measured at microscopic and macroscopic length scales, with their microstructure and composition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajashri Parida, Biswajit Paul, Soumya Ranjan Padhi, Tapan Mishra</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground state properties of spinless fermions on a two leg ladder, by allowing the nearest-neighbour hopping dimerization in one leg and uniform hopping in the other. In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg hopping is allowed. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition as a function of interaction. Moreover, we show that for both the non-interacting and interacting cases, topological nature of the system survives even by altering the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg, resulting in two topological phases of opposite character. Finally, we reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) phase.</p>

            <p>Emergent collective excitations constitute a hallmark of interacting quantum many-body systems, yet in solid-state platforms their study has been largely limited by the constraints of linear-response probes and by finite momentum resolution. We propose to overcome these limitations by combining the spatial resolution of ultracold atomic systems with the nonlinear probing capabilities of two-dimensional spectroscopy (2DS). As a concrete illustration, we analyze momentum-resolved 2DS of the quantum sine-Gordon model describing the low energy dynamics of two weakly coupled one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. This approach reveals distinctive many-body signatures, most notably asymmetric cross-peaks reflecting the interplay between isolated ($B_2$ breather) and continuum ($B_1$ pair) modes. The protocol further enables direct characterization of anharmonicity and disorder, establishing momentum-resolved 2DS as both a powerful diagnostic for quantum simulators and a versatile probe of correlated quantum matter.</p>

            <p>The inverse design of materials with specific desired properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, represents a formidable challenge in materials science due to the vastness of chemical and structural space. We present a guided diffusion framework to accelerate the discovery of novel superconductors. A DiffCSP foundation model is pretrained on the Alexandria Database and fine-tuned on 7,183 superconductors with first principles derived labels. Employing classifier-free guidance, we sample 200,000 structures, which lead to 34,027 unique candidates. A multistage screening process that combines machine learning and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess stability and electronic properties, identifies 773 candidates with DFT-calculated $T_\mathrm{c}>5$ K. Notably, our generative model demonstrates effective property-driven design. Our computational findings were validated against experimental synthesis and characterization performed as part of this work, which highlighted challenges in sparsely charted chemistries.

            <p>Programmable quantum devices provide a platform to control the coherent dynamics of quantum wavefunctions. Here we experimentally realize adaptive monitored quantum circuits, which incorporate conditional feedback into non-unitary evolution, to control quantum chaotic dynamics using a combination of local mid-circuit measurements and resets. The experiments are performed with an IBM superconducting quantum processor using up to 100 qubits that samples a quantum version of the classically chaotic Bernoulli map. This map scrambles quantum information, while local measurements and feedback attempt to steer the dynamics toward a state that is a fixed point of the map. This competition drives a dynamical phase transition between quantum and classical dynamics that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically using noisy simulations, matrix product states, and mappings to statistical mechanics models. Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Nolte, JÃ¶rn Bonse, Nadezhda M. Bulgakova</p>
            <p>Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.</p>

            <p>High power lasers are used for a variety of manufacturing processes on time and length scales that cover many orders of magnitude and on different materials. The variety of processes achievable through laser-material interaction results from numerous coupled, nonlinear physical phenomena. Simulation models can be used to gain process understanding, explain experimentally observed phenomena, and optimize or design processes. However, the inherent complexity and diversity of the phenomena make modeling a challenging task. Within this chapter, a universal model is presented that accurately simulates a broad spectrum of processes, including welding, additive manufacturing, cutting, ablation, drilling, and surface structuring, encompassing both continuous wave and ultrashort pulsed lasers and their interaction with various materials. Starting from the fundamental principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, a continuum mechanical framework is introduced that captures the main multiphysical effects. A numerical solution using the Finite Volume Method is presented and validated against benchmark problems where detailed experimental data are available. Macroscopic examples with continuous wave lasers include keyhole drilling and collapse under stationary illumination as well as melt pool dynamics and pore formation in copper welding. At the microscopic level, copper ablation with femtosecond pulses is simulated. Finally, a set of real-world applications is shown, where the model helps to explain and optimize industrial phenomena and defects. Examples include deep penetration welding of steel with dynamic beam shaping, multilayer additive manufacturing via powder bed fusion, and ultrashort pulsed drilling of micro vias in dielectric materials.</p>

            <p>Mechanistic microstructure-informed constitutive models for the mechanical response of polycrystals are a cornerstone of computational materials science. However, as these models become increasingly more complex - often involving coupled differential equations describing the effect of specific deformation modes - their associated computational costs can become prohibitive, particularly in optimization or uncertainty quantification tasks that require numerous model evaluations. To address this challenge, surrogate constitutive models that balance accuracy and computational efficiency are highly desirable. Data-driven surrogate models, that learn the constitutive relation directly from data, have emerged as a promising solution. In this work, we develop two local surrogate models for the viscoplastic response of a steel: a piecewise response surface method and a mixture of experts model. These surrogates are designed to adapt to complex material behavior, which may vary with material parameters or operating conditions. The surrogate constitutive models are applied to creep simulations of HT-9 steel, an alloy of considerable interest to the nuclear energy sector due to its high tolerance to radiation damage, using training data generated from viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) simulations. We define a set of test metrics to numerically assess the accuracy of our surrogate models for predicting viscoplastic material behavior, and show that the mixture of experts model outperforms the piecewise response surface method in terms of accuracy.</p>

            <p>We develop a Hybrid Optimal Velocity-Drag (OVD) model that combines the behavioral structure of the classical Optimal Velocity Model (OVM) with a drag-based saturation law motivated by Newtonian mechanics. The model retains the OVM principle that desired speed depends on headway, but replaces the linear relaxation law with a formulation that enforces bounded accelerations and smooth convergence to equilibrium. After reviewing the OVM framework and its stability properties, we introduce the OVD dynamics and derive the dispersion relation from a linear stability analysis of uniform flow. This analysis shows that the OVD formulation preserves the instability mechanisms responsible for stop-and-go waves, while avoiding the unrealistic acceleration predictions of the classical OVM. We also illustrate the model using desired velocity functions of hyperbolic tangent type, a common choice in the OVM literature, and highlight applications to large-scale traffic simulation and empirical data studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the OVD model enforces bounded accelerations while preserving the nonlinear instabilities of the classical OVM, providing a physically grounded and interpretable foundation for advancing traffic flow research.</p>

            <p>Measuring universal data in the strongly correlated regime of quantum critical points remains a fundamental objective for quantum simulators. In foundational work, Calabrese and Cardy demonstrated how this data governs the dynamics of certain global quenches to 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories. While the quasiparticle picture they introduce has been widely successful in both theory and experiment, their seminal prediction that the critical exponents are simply encoded in the relaxation rates of local observables is more challenging to investigate experimentally; in particular, the specific initial state required for their analysis is generated via imaginary time evolution. In this work, we examine the critical quench dynamics of local observables from two types of readily-accessible initial conditions: ground states and finite-temperature ensembles. We identify universal scaling collapses and scaling functions in both cases, utilizing a combination of conformal perturbation theory and tensor network numerics. For the finite-temperature quenches, we determine a regime in which the conformal field theory results are recovered, thereby allowing universal quantum critical data to be extracted from realistic quenches.</p>

In this free-theory regime, no genuine thermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the event horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an apparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from the horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true equilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal only with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal behaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole interior.</p>

We show that if dark matter is wave-like and couples weakly to electrons, superconducting parameters such as the gap and critical temperature become dynamical quantities that oscillate in time. This modifies the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer framework and produces distinctive temporal signatures whose sensitivity increases with longer measurement durations. Our results illustrate how condensed matter systems, traditionally treated as isolated from their cosmological environment, may acquire new dynamical degrees of freedom from their cosmic embedding.

            <p>High-throughput materials discovery and studies of complex functional materials increasingly rely on multi-modal characterization performed at synchrotron light sources. However, measurements are typically done with no use of data until after an experiment, neglecting opportunities for data-driven insights to guide measurements. We developed a modular, open-source framework that incorporates artificial intelligence within the Bluesky control and data streaming infrastructure at NSLS-II, enabling real-time orchestration of multi-beamline, multi-modal experiments. AI agents perform on-the-fly reduction, clustering, Gaussian process modelling, and Bayesian optimization driven data acquisition, while users monitor agent behavior and visualize results live. Combinatorial libraries of the ternary Al-Ni-Pt system were spatially mapped by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at the PDF and BMM beamlines, respectively. Dynamic switching between AI-driven and conventional grid mapping strategies was achieved, demonstrating the flexible workflows possible through this framework. A digital twin constructed from a simulated Al-Li-Fe oxide dataset shows that AI-driven mapping strategies outperform conventional mapping as well as random sampling by prioritizing measurements that better resolve both phase boundaries and localized minority phases. This framework supports plug-and-play capabilities, and establishes a foundation for routine multi-modal, AI-assisted large-scale user-facility operations.</p>

            <p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atma Anand</p>
            <p>Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</p>

We further use the nuclear spin as a long-lived quantum memory to enhance AC magnetic field sensing via correlation spectroscopy.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyi Meng, Benjamin Piazza, Csaba Both, Baruch Barzel, Albert-LÃ¡szlÃ³ BarabÃ¡si</p>
            <p>The brain's connectome and the vascular system are examples of physical networks whose tangible nature influences their structure, layout, and ultimately their function. The material resources required to build and maintain these networks have inspired decades of research into wiring economy, offering testable predictions about their expected architecture and organisation. Here we empirically explore the local branching geometry of a wide range of physical networks, uncovering systematic violations of the long-standing predictions of length and volume minimisation. This leads to the hypothesis that predicting the true material cost of physical networks requires us to account for their full three-dimensional geometry, resulting in a largely intractable optimisation problem. We discover, however, an exact mapping of surface minimisation onto high-dimensional Feynman diagrams in string theory, predicting that with increasing link thickness, a locally tree-like network undergoes a transition into configurations that can no longer be explained by length minimisation. Specifically, surface minimisation predicts the emergence of trifurcations and branching angles in excellent agreement with the local tree organisation of physical networks across a wide range of application domains. Finally, we predict the existence of stable orthogonal sprouts, which not only are prevalent in real networks but also play a key functional role, improving synapse formation in the brain and nutrient access in plants and fungi.</p>

            <p>The search for primordial B-modes in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) requires highly sensitive and scalable detector systems. The magnetic microbolometer (MMB) is an emerging detector concept that exploits the magnetic properties of paramagnetic materials at sub-kelvin temperatures, offering bolometers with a high dynamic range and low intrinsic noise. In recent years, the microwave SQUID multiplexer ($\mu$MUX) has become a key technology to efficiently read large low temperature detector arrays, enabling the readout of hundreds to thousands of detectors over a single transmission line with low noise and minimal power dissipation while reducing the cryogenic setup complexity. In this work, we report the design, fabrication and characterization of a $\mu$MUX optimized for MMB detectors and share our latest experimental results from a bolometer prototype. These findings provide valuable insight of the $\mu$MUX in advancing next-generation CMB instrumentation and also demonstrate its suitability for novel detector technologies such as the MMB.</p>

            <h2>How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sihan Hu, Xiansheng Cai, Yuan Huang, Zhiyuan Yao, Linfeng Zhang, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng, Kun Chen</p>
            <p>Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands'' form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory, we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</p>

            <h2>Haag Duality for 2D Quantum Spin Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshiko Ogata, David PÃ©rez-GarcÃ­a, Alberto Ruiz-de-AlarcÃ³n</p>
            <p>Haag duality is a strong notion of locality for two-dimensional lattice quantum spin systems, requiring that the commutant of the algebra of observables supported in a cone-like region coincides with the algebra of observables in its complement. Originally introduced within algebraic quantum field theory, Haag duality has recently become pivotal in the operator-algebraic analysis of quantum many-body systems. In particular, it plays a key role in the description of anyonic excitations, which are widely believed to classify two-dimensional non-chiral gapped quantum phases of matter. Prior to this work, Haag duality had only been rigorously established for Kitaev's quantum double models with abelian input groups. In this paper, we establish that two-dimensional tensor network states based on biconnected $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras satisfy Haag duality. These states include as particular cases Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and we expect them to encompass representatives of all non-chiral phases. Our proof relies on deriving an operator-algebraic sufficient condition for Haag duality in finite systems, which we verify using tensor-network methods. As part of our analysis, we extend the tensor-network bulk-boundary correspondence, construct explicit commuting parent Hamiltonians for these models, and prove that in the biconnected case they satisfy the local topological quantum order condition.</p>

            <h2>Integrable Spherical Brane Model at Large $N$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Gheisarieha, Ramtin M. Yazdi, Arash Arabi Ardehali</p>
            <p>We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, while larger $N$ is analogous to multi-channel or higher-spin impurity scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</p>

            <p>Topological boundary states exhibit distinctive properties, including unidirectional propagation and noise robustness, which hold significant potential for advancing the performance of quantum science and technology. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of non-Abelian quantum interference and entanglement generation, protected by dual symmetries (time-independent inversion and time-dependent interchain), in coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. Specifically, in a multi-chain system, we first achieve tunable topological transfer of a single particle, where the destination chain is selected by the braiding sequence. We then extend this to two particles, observing a non-Abelian Hong-Ou-Mandel interference that generates spatially entangled NOON states whose properties are dictated by the braiding order. Our work establishes an alternative pathway for exploring non-Abelian topology applied to quantum science and technology, enabled by the unique protection of time-dependent symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florence Raynal, Menghua Zhao, Romain Volk</p>
            <p>In this article, we study experimentally the dispersion of colloids in a two-dimensional, time independent, Rayleigh-BÃ©nard flow in the presence of salt gradients. Due to the additional scalar, the colloids do not follow exactly the Eulerian flow-field, but have a (small) extra-velocity $\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{dp}} = D_{\mathrm{dp}} \nabla \log C_s$, where $D_\mathrm{dp}$ is the phoretic constant and $C_s$ the salt concentration. Such a configuration is motivated by the theoretical work by Volk \textit{et al.} (JFM, 2022), which predicted enhanced transport or blockage in a stationary cellular flow depending on the value of a blockage coefficient. By means of High Dynamical Range Light Induced Fluorescence, we study the evolution of the colloids concentration field at large PÃ©clet number. We find a good agreement with the theoretical work although a number of hypotheses are not satisfied, as the experiment is non homogeneous in space and intrinsically transient. In particular we observe enhanced transport when salt and colloids are injected at both ends of the Rayleigh-BÃ©nard chamber, and blockage when colloids and salt are injected together and phoretic effects are strong enough.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arijit Mohanta, Zakia Farhat, Yeshudan Bora, Saurabh Dubey, Nafisa Arfa, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>Micro/nanoporous membranes have been used extensively in biological and medical applications associated with filtration, particle sorting, cell separation, and real-time sensing. Expanding its applications to microfluidics offers several advantages, such as precise control over fluid flow rates, regulated reaction times, and efficient product extraction. This study demonstrates a simple, cost-effective, rapid, single-step method for the synthesis of nanoporous membranes within a microfluidic device. The membrane is prepared by filling up the microchamber with cellulose acetate dissolved in N, N-dimethylformamide, and 1-hexanol, followed by the continuous flow of water as an antisolvent. Mixing CA-DMF with antisolvent water leads to an in-situ synthesis of cellulose acetate nanoparticles (CANPs) at the Water-DMF interface. The continuous flow of water ensures the coagulation of CANPs, forming nanoporous membranes. The thickness, porosity, and wettability of the membrane are dependent on the flow rate of water and the concentration of CA dissolved in DMF. Apart from its wide application in cell and biomolecule separation, this membrane can be used to detect biomarkers or pathogens in clinical samples. Additionally, these nanoporous membranes can be used to detect and filter environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and emulsified oil from water. In summary, the synthesis of CANP nanoporous membranes within microfluidic channels with adjustable porosity enhances the potential uses of micro/nanomembranes in both healthcare and environmental contexts.</p>

            <p>We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>General Framework for Twisted Bilayer Photonic Crystal with Interlayer Coupling and Far-Field Response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shupeng Xu, Dun Wang, Ritesh Agarwal</p>
            <p>We develop a general theory for twisted bilayer photonic crystals that takes into account both far-field response and near-field coupling. The theory is based on the framework of a generalized Rayleigh-SchrÃ¶dinger perturbation theory for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A universal form for interlayer coupling is derived, which relates the hopping strength to the Fourier transforms of the Wannier functions in the single layer photonic crystal. For low energy states at the K point in hexagonal lattices, the interlayer coupling reduces to that in the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for graphene. As an example, we study a twisted bilayer photonic crystal slab with air holes arranged in a honeycomb lattice in each layer. The first order solution of our model predicts a four-fold band splitting in the far-field spectrum compared to the single-layer case, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, our theory reveals that for low energy states at K points, scattering towards the {\Gamma} point via the moirÃ© potential is suppressed. Based on our theory, we propose a wide-angle, high-Q tunable flat band cavity by combining the bilayer at a large twist angle with a Brillouinzone-folding perturbation within each layer. The cavity behaves like a collection of quasi-bound states in the continuum with a divergent density of states, with potential applications in nonlinear optics, lasing and quantum optics.</p>

            <h2>Population genetics in complex ecological communities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shing Yan Li, Zhijie Feng, Akshit Goyal, Pankaj Mehta</p>
            <p>Ecological interactions can dramatically alter evolutionary outcomes in complex communities. Yet, the classic theoretical results of population genetics (e.g., Kimura's fixation formula) largely ignore ecological effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by using dynamical mean-field theory to integrate ecology into classical population genetics models. We show that ecological interactions between parents and mutants result in frequency-dependent selection and can be characterized by a single emergent parameter that measures the strength of ecological feedbacks. We derive an explicit analytic expression for the fixation probability that generalizes Kimura's famous result and analyze it in various ecological and evolutionary limits. We find that ecological interactions suppress fixation probabilities for moderately beneficial mutants when compared to Kimura's predictions, with the strength of suppression increasing with larger effective population sizes, greater selective differences between parent and mutant, and for ecosystems with a large number of "open niches" (i.e., ecosystems well below the packing bound). Frequency-dependent selection also gives rise to prolonged parent-mutant coexistence in complex communities, a phenomenon absent in classical population genetics. Our study establishes a framework for integrating ecological interactions into population genetics models and helps illuminate how ecology can affect evolutionary outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Decoupling hydrodynamization from thermalization via nonlinear Boltzmann equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingjian Lu, Shuzhe Shi</p>
            <p>The early thermalization puzzle arises from the unexpectedly early applicability of hydrodynamics in heavy-ion collisions. While hydrodynamics has traditionally been associated with the onset of local thermal equilibrium, its derivations -- whether microscopic or macroscopic -- rely instead on linearization around equilibrium. However, the linearization timescale -- the time at which a system's evolution begins to follow a linearized equation -- has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we employ the spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation -- the lowest-order truncation of the spectral Bogoliubov--Born--Green--Kirkwood--Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy -- to analyze the timescales of linearization and thermalization under three distinct truncation schemes. The first two truncations allow for analytic treatment via recursive spectral equations, while the third requires numerical methods for generic initial conditions. The analysis is performed for a homogeneous, massless system with a constant differential cross section. For this simplified setup, we find a robust separation: the linearization time is consistently about half the thermalization time ($\tau_{\mathrm{lin}}/\tau_{\mathrm{therm}} \approx 1/2$). This separation of timescales suggests an explanation for the early applicability of hydrodynamics and points toward a possible quantitative resolution of the early thermalization puzzle.</p>

            <p>Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials. First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However, these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.</p>

            <p>Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.</p>

            <p>The quantum Zeno effect (QZE) reveals that frequent measurements can suppress quantum evolution, but the detailed dynamics of the system under finite-duration measurements in experiments remain insufficiently explored. Here, we employ an optical dipole trap as a projective measurement to study the motion of a single cold atom in free space. By monitoring atomic loss, we directly observe the QZE in single-atom motion in free space and find that the effect of dipole measurements on the atom comprises a short-time collapse followed by subsequent periodic unitary evolution, thereby providing an intuitive physical picture of measurement backaction across different timescales. We further investigate the effects of measurement frequency, strength, and spatial position, demonstrating that measurements not only suppress the spreading of quantum states but also enable deterministic preparation of distinct motional states. Furthermore, by dynamically controlling the measurement position, we achieve measurement-induced directional transport of a single atom without imparting additional momentum. Our results provide a direct experimental demonstration of the QZE in real space and establish a versatile framework for measurement-based control of atomic motion, paving the way for motional-state engineering in cold-atom platforms.</p>

            <p>Reaching lasing in electrically pumped microdevices based on solution-processed semiconductors poses a major scientific and technological challenge. Halide perovskites offer a promising platform for electrical injection, since their optically excited single-crystal cavities and predesigned or postprocessed microstructures have exhibited low lasing threshold. Indirect electrical pumping of a dual-cavity perovskite laser was recently obtained, utilizing a well-established technological concept of embedding a high-luminosity light-emitting diode (LED) with a high-gain medium into an integrated device. Direct charge-carrier injection into a perovskite LED excited by auxiliary short-, optical-pulses resulted into amplified spontaneous emission. Other efforts for rational engineering of architectures that allow for high charge-carrier density are still to demonstrate lasing. Here, we develop a novel strategy for achieving direct electrical pumping of a perovskite laser. We integrate a solution-grown CsPbBr3 microplate with chemically inert single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes and embed them into an optical microcavity. By cooling the microdevice down to 8 K at a constant current, a perovskite p-i-n diode is formed that facilitates a balanced carrier injection at high current densities. The perovskite microcavity diode operates in the strong coupling regime, exhibiting polariton lasing under a direct current of 65 uA.</p>

            <p>In this letter, by an approach that employs Weyl symbols for operators, a semiclassical theory is developed for the offdiagonal function in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which is for offdiagonal elements $\langle{E_i}\left|O\right|{E_j}\rangle$ of an observable $O$ on the energy basis. It is shown analytically that the matrix of $O$ has a banded structure, possessing a bandwidth $w_b$ that scales linearly with $\hbar$, a phase-space gradient of the classical Hamiltonian, $\langle\left|{\boldsymbol{\nabla }H_{\rm cl}}\right|\rangle$, and an $O$-dependent property. This predicts that the thermalization timescale of a quantum system may be inversely proportional to the phase-space gradient of the Hamiltonian, aligning with intuitions in classical thermalization. This approach also elucidates the origin of a $\rho_{\rm dos}^{-1/2}$-scaling of the offdiagonal function. The analytical predictions are checked numerically in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</p>

            <p>Hereby, we study the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons at telecom C-band by biexciton-exciton cascade from non-resonantly excited epitaxial InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs). It is realized without external tuning of the fine structure splitting (FSS), which does not exceed 10 $\mu$eV in as-grown nanostructures, due to their high in-plane symmetry. Excitonic complexes are identified by means of excitation power-dependent and polarization-resolved magneto)microphotoluminescence. Their origin from different carrier configurations confined in the same QD is confirmed by time correlations of emitted photons. Experimental results are supported by 8-band kp calculations, followed by the configuration interaction method to include excitonic effects. This comparison reveals the structure of higher energy states, allowing for the reconstruction of the QD structural parameters. To verify and quantify the entanglement, we perform quantum state tomography and reconstruct the two-photon density matrix. Its diagonalization allows a detailed analysis of the entangled state and reveals an unfavourable interplay between phase accumulation and decoherence, pointing to a clear route for boosting entanglement by using a XX resonant, pulsed excitation scheme and shortening the radiative lifetimes.</p>

We prove the method to be exact in the case of Gaussian theories and then extend it to the interacting Sine-Gordon model. Although no longer exact in this framework, the method captures the dynamics through a self-consistent time-dependent harmonic approximation and reveals an entanglement phase transition in the steady state from an area-law to a logarithmic-law scaling.</p>

            <p>Among the thriving quantum computation and quantum simulation platforms based on arrays of Rydberg atoms, those using circular Rydberg atoms are particularly promising. These atoms uniquely combine the strong dipole-dipole interactions typical of Rydberg states with long lifetimes. However, low-angular-momentum ($\ell$) laser-accessible Rydberg levels have been so far mostly used, because circular Rydberg atoms have no optical transitions, hindering their individual detection and manipulation. We remove this limitation with a hybrid platform, combining an array of logical laser-trapped circular Rydberg atoms of rubidium with an auxiliary array of Rb ancilla atoms transiently excited to a low-$\ell$ Rydberg level. We perform a quantum non-demolition detection of the logical qubit with the ancilla, through the blockade of the ancilla optical excitation induced by a FÃ¶rster resonance. Conversely, we locally manipulate the logical qubit through the excitation of the ancilla. This dual-Rydberg platform is highly promising for quantum computation and simulation. It adds to the circular-atom toolbox the mid-circuit measurements, essential for error correction. More strikingly, it gives access to time correlations in long-term quantum simulations, uniquely accessible to circular Rydberg atoms.</p>

In particular, phosphorus (P)-doped spin qubits possess excellent coherence and have demonstrated high-fidelity two-qubit gates exceeding 99.9%. However, scaling P-donor systems is challenging due to crosstalk caused by the uniformity of individual P donors and the low tolerance for imprecise atomic placement. Stochastic placement can lead to multiple donors located within a small region (diameter <3 nm), forming a so-called donor cluster. Notably, in cluster-based systems, high-fidelity multi-qubit quantum gates and all-to-all connectivity have recently been demonstrated experimentally on nuclear spin qubits. In this work, we propose a scalable cluster-array architecture for nuclear spin qubits and a corresponding control protocol. We analyze crosstalk-induced errors, a major error source, during primitive operations under various parameters, showing that they can be suppressed through device design and control optimization. We evaluate the fidelities of intra- and inter-cluster multi-qubit gates between nuclear spins, confirming the feasibility of our architecture and establishing design requirements and parameter targets. The local all-to-all connectivity within clusters provides unique flexibility for quantum error correction. Our scalable scheme provides a path toward large-scale spin-based quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Quantum error detection is essential in realizing large-scale universal quantum computation, especially for quantum error correction (QEC). However, key elements for FTQC have yet to be realized in silicon qubits. Here, we demonstrate quantum error detection on a donor-based silicon quantum processor comprising four-nuclear spin qubits and one electron spin as an auxiliary qubit. The entanglement capability of this system is validated through the establishment of two-qubit Bell state entanglement between the nuclear spins and the generation of a four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, achieving a GHZ state fidelity of 88.5(2.3)%. Furthermore, by executing a four-qubit error detection circuit with the stabilizers, we successfully detect arbitrary single-qubit errors. The encoded Bell state entanglement information is recovered by performing the Pauli-frame update (PFU) via postprocessing. Based on the detected errors, we identify strongly biased noise in our system. Our results mark a significant advance toward FTQC in silicon spin qubits.</p>

            <h2>Collision types and times in interacting particle systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio Andraus, Nicole Hufnagel, Jacek MaÅecki</p>
            <p>We consider a system of stochastic interacting particles with general diffusion coefficient and drift functions and we study the types of collisions that arise in them. In particular, interactions between particles are inversely proportional to their separation, and the coupling function of interaction is also considered in great generality. Our main result indicates that under very mild conditions, all collisions are simple almost surely, namely, only one pair of particles collides at any time, while more complicated collisions such as three-body or disjoint two-body collisions occur with zero probability. In order to obtain our results we make use of symmetric polynomials on the square of particle separations; the degree of these polynomials indicates the type of collision, and by a locality argument we show that polynomials indicating a non-simple collision almost surely do not cancel. We make use of our main result to study the Hausdorff dimension of times at which collisions occur, and we show that this dimension is given by the ratio between the interaction coupling and diffusion functions. Our results cover many of the most well-known particle systems, such as the Dyson model and Wishart processes and their extensions to non-constant diffusion coefficients and background drifts.</p>

            <p>Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning, yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.</p>

            <p>We present a topology grounded, multiscale simulation platform for morphogenesis and biological active matter. Morphogenesis and biological active matter represent keystone problems in biology with additional, far-reaching implications across the biomedical sciences. Addressing these problems will require flexible, cross-scale models of tissue shape, development, and dysfunction that can be tuned to understand, model, and predict relevant individual cases. Current approaches to simulating anatomical or cellular subsystems tend to rely on static, assumed shapes. Meanwhile, the potential for topology to provide natural dimensionality reduction and organization of shape and dynamical outcomes is not fully exploited. TopoSPAM combines ease of use with powerful simulation algorithms and methodological advances, including active nematic gels, topological-defect-driven shape dynamics, and an active 3D vertex model of tissues. It is capable of determining emergent flows and shapes across scales.</p>

            <p>We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks, given by the recently introduced attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass physics, and approximate message passing, we derive sharp asymptotics for training and test errors, locate interpolation and recovery thresholds, and characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the learned weights. Weight decay induces an implicit nuclear-norm regularization, favoring low-rank query and key matrices. Leveraging this, we compare the standard factorized training of query and key matrices with a direct parameterization in which their product is trained element-wise, revealing the inductive bias introduced by the factorized form. Remarkably, the predicted spectral distribution echoes empirical trends reported in large-scale transformers, offering a theoretical perspective consistent with these phenomena.</p>

            <p>Magnetically levitated spinning rotors are key elements in important technologies such as navigation by gyroscopes, energy storage by flywheels, ultra-high vacuum generation by turbomolecular pumps, and pressure sensing for process control. However, mechanical rotors are typically macroscopic and limited to room temperature and low rotation frequencies. In particular, sensing pressure at low temperatures remains a technological challenge, while emerging quantum technologies demand a precise evaluation of pressure conditions at low temperatures to cope with quantum-spoiling decoherence. To close this gap, we demonstrate wide range pressure sensing by a spinning rotor based on a micromagnet levitated by the Meissner effect at 4.2 Kelvin. We achieve rotational speeds of up to 138 million rotations per minute, resulting in very high effective quality factors, outperforming current platforms. Beside sensing applications, we envision the use of levitated rotors for probing fundamental science including quantum mechanics and gravity, enabled by ultralow torque noise.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hesam Arabzadeh, Dmitri Kireev</p>
            <p>Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center Recognition potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian NÃ¤gele, Florian Marquardt</p>
            <p>The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</p>

            <h2>Effective Free Energy Landscapes and Hawking-Page Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Choon-Lin Ho</p>
            <p>A recent interesting development on the dynamics of black hole phase transitions, the Hawking-Page transition, has been the so-called Gibbs free energy landscape approach. In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a canonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon radius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is defined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius treated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond to the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free energy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an associated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which is independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the Fokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by considering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale with black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can be used to study the modification of the Hawking-Page transition of a black hole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes under a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy become extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some theoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing functions of the horizon radius are considered. It is found that stronger noise disfavors the formation of black hole.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing work-extraction in quantum batteries via correlated reservoirs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sejal Ahuja, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>Going beyond isolated system dynamics, we examine how local and spatially correlated reservoirs influence the work extraction in quantum batteries. By employing a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model coupled to baths via dephasing and amplitude-damping noise, we demonstrate that correlations in reservoirs can significantly enhance battery's performance compared to local noise. In the dephasing scenario, we prove that correlated reservoirs produce a finite amount of extractable work, or ergotropy, during the transient regime when a two-cell battery is initialized in a product state while local noise yields vanishing ergotropy at all times, despite nonvanishing stored energy in both cases. Numerical simulations confirm that this advantage persists across larger system sizes and for both entangled and product initial states. We also find that the dynamics of quantum coherence closely mirror those of ergotropy, highlighting coherence as a key resource underlying the enhanced performance of quantum batteries. Further, we observe that the fraction of stored energy extracted from quantum batteries displays a sharper contrast between the correlated and local reservoirs. Moreover, for dephasing noise, this fraction remains independent of system size, whereas in the amplitude damping case, it exhibits a clear system-size dependence within the transient regime, highlighting distinct operational behaviors under different noise models. In addition, we reveal that when the battery dynamics is governed by an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions, it yields higher ergotropy compared to short-range interactions, emphasizing the advantages of reservoir engineering for efficient device design.</p>

            <p>Effectively tuning magnetic state by using current is essential for novel spintronic devices. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have shown superior properties for the applications of magnetic information storage based on the efficient spin torque effect. However, for most of known vdW ferromagnets, the ferromagnetic transition temperatures lower than room temperature strongly impede their applications and the room-temperature vdW spintronic device with low energy consumption is still a long-sought goal. Here, we realize the highly efficient room-temperature nonvolatile magnetic switching by current in a single-material device based on vdW ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. Moreover, the switching current density and power dissipation are about 300 and 60000 times smaller than conventional spin-orbit-torque devices of magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures. These findings make an important progress on the applications of magnetic vdW materials in the fields of spintronics and magnetic information storage.</p>

            <p>Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</p>

            <p>The Hubbard model is a standard theoretical tool for studying materials with strong electron-electron interactions, such as the cuprate superconductors. Unfortunately, interaction-driven phenomena such as the transition into the strongly correlated Mott insulator phase are difficult to treat with established theoretical techniques. However, the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto model displays similar Mott physics. Here we show how the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model can be deformed continuously into the Hubbard model. The trick is to systematically re-introduce all the momentum mixing the original Hatsugai-Kohmoto model omits. This can be accomplished by grouping $n$-momenta into a cell and hybridizing them resulting in the momentum-mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto (MMHK) model. We recover the Bethe ansatz ground state energy of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to within 1$\%$ from only ten mixed momenta. Overall the convergence scales as $1/n^2$ as opposed to the inverse linear behaviour of standard finite-cluster techniques. Our results for a square lattice reproduce all known features from state-of-the-art simulations also with only a few mixed momenta. Consequently, we believe the MMHK model offers an alternative tool for strongly correlated quantum matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Kong, Zhi-Hao Zhang, Jiaheng Zhao, Hao Zheng</p>
            <p>We develop a unified mathematical theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. A k-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an n+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $C^{n+1}$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. Condensing such a defect $A$ amounts to a k-step process. In the first step, we condense the defect $A$ along one of its transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-1)-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which is naturally equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra. In the second step, we condense the defect $\Sigma A$ in one of the remaining transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-2)-codimensional defect $\Sigma^2 A$, so on and so forth. In the k-th step, we condense the 1-codimensional defect $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction, thus defining a phase transition from $C^{n+1}$ to a new n+1D topological order $D^{n+1}$. We give precise mathematical descriptions of each step in above process, including the precise mathematical characterization of the condensed phase $D^{n+1}$. When $C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same phase transition can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly along the remaining two transversal directions. When n=2, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. We derive many new mathematical results physically along the way. We also establish the connections among various notions of "gauging" symmetries. We also briefly discuss questions, generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our theory, including higher Morita theory, a theory of integrals and the condensations of liquid-like gapless defects in topological orders.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-Zhi Bai, Bo Fu, Shun-Qing Shen</p>
            <p>We develop a Dirac fermion theory for topological phases in magnetic topological insulator films. The theory is based on exact solutions of the energies and the wave functions for an effective model of the three-dimensional topological insulator (TI) film. It is found that the TI film consists of a pair of massless or massive Dirac fermions for the surface states, and a series of massive Dirac fermions for the bulk states. The massive Dirac fermion always carries zero or integer quantum Hall conductance when the valence band is fully occupied while the massless Dirac fermion carries a one-half quantum Hall conductance when the chemical potential is located around the Dirac point for a finite range. The magnetic exchange interaction in the magnetic layers in the film can be used to manipulate either the masses or chirality of the Dirac fermions and gives rise to distinct topological phases, which cover the known topological insulating phases, such as quantum anomalous Hall effect, quantum spin Hall effect and axion effect, and also the novel topological metallic phases, such as half quantized Hall effect, half quantum mirror Hall effect, and metallic quantum anomalous Hall effect.</p>

            <p>We analyze quantum interference in the triplet-exciton pair generated by singlet exciton fission in a molecular crystal, and introduce transport-induced dephasing (TID) as a key effect that can suppress the expected fluorescence quantum beats when the triplet-exciton wavefunction can localize on inequivalent sites. TID depends on the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites and on the energy-shifts among the stationary states of the entangled triplet pair in different spatial configurations. The theoretical model is confirmed by experiments in rubrene single crystals, where triplet pairs remain entangled for more than 50 ns but quantum beats are suppressed by TID within a few nanoseconds when the magnetic field is misaligned by just a few degrees from specific symmetric directions. Our experiments deliver the zero-field parameters for the rubrene molecule in its orthorhombic lattice and information on triplet-exciton transport, in particular the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites, which we evaluate to be of the order of 150 ps in rubrene.</p>

            <p>Dopants can significantly affect the properties of oxide ceramics through their impact on the property-determined microstructure characteristics such as grain boundary (GB) segregation, space charge layer formation in the GB vicinity, and the grain growth deviating from normal patterns. To support the rational design of oxide ceramics, we propose a defect-chemistry-informed phase-field grain growth model to simulate the microstructure evolution of oxide ceramics. It fully respects the defect-chemistry theory by accounting for the distinct segregation energies and available site densities of charged point defects (oxygen vacancies and acceptor dopants) in both the grain interior and boundaries, and it considers the competing kinetics of defect diffusion and GB movement. The proposed phase-field model is benchmarked against well-known bicrystal models, including the Mott-Schottky and Gouy-Chapman models. Various simulation results are presented to reveal the effect of different defect-chemistry parameters on the space charge layer formation and key microstructural aspects. In particular, simulation results confirm that the solute drag effect alone can lead to skewed grain size distribution that do not follow the log-normal distribution, without any contribution from grain misorientation and other anisotropy. Interestingly, simulations also demonstrate that grain boundary potentials can vary substantially: GBs of larger grains tend to have lower potentials than those of smaller grains. Such heterogeneous GB potential distribution may inspire a new material optimization strategy through microstructure design. This study provides a comprehensive framework for defect-chemistry-consistent investigations of microstructure evolution in polycrystalline oxide ceramics, offering fundamental insights into microscopic processes during critical manufacturing stages.</p>

            <p>We propose a new scheme for realizing Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) Cooper pairing states within flat bands, in contrast to the conventional paradigm such as the Zeeman effect. Central to our scheme is the concept of ``quantum geometric discrepancy'' (QGD) that measures differences in the quantum geometry of paired electrons and drives the flat-band FFLO instability. Remarkably, we find that this instability is directly related to a quantum geometric quantity known as ``anomalous quantum distance'', which formally captures QGD. To model both QGD and the anomalous quantum distance, we examine a flat-band electronic Hamiltonian with tunable spin-dependent quantum metrics. Utilizing the band-projection method, we analyze the QGD-induced FFLO instability from pairing susceptibility. Furthermore, we perform mean-field numerical simulations to obtain the phase diagram of the BCS-FFLO transition, which aligns well with our analytical results. Our work demonstrates that QGD offers a general and distinctive mechanism for stabilizing the flat-band FFLO phase.</p>

Time-, energy- and momentum-resolved nonequilibrium carrier dynamics reveal that intra- and inter-band scattering processes play a capital role in the relaxation mechanism, leading to multivalley electron-hole accumulation near the Fermi level. We also show that electrons' inverse lifetime has a linear dependence on their binding energy.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Paeckel</p>
            <p>The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Greens-functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta\omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta\omega = 2/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this fundamental limitation can be overcome using complex-time Krylov spaces. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.</p>

            <h2>Eigenstate thermalization to non-monotonic distributions in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir A. Yurovsky (School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University), Amichay Vardi (Department of Chemistry, Ben-Gurion University and ITAMP, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)</p>
            <p>We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</p>

            <h2>Improving accuracy of tree-tensor network approach by optimization of network structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda, Kouichi Okunishi, Kenji Harada, Tomotoshi Nishino</p>
            <p>Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model in order to analyze how the performance of the algorithm depends on the detailed updating schemes of the structural optimization. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.</p>

            <h2>Quantitative study on anomalous Nernst effect in Co thin films by laser irradiation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soichiro Mochizuki, Itaru Sugiura, Tetsuya Narushima, Teruo Ono, Takuya Satoh, Kihiro T. Yamada</p>
            <p>The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generates electromotive forces transverse to temperature gradients and has attracted much attention for potential applications into novel thermoelectric power generators. ANE efficiency is generally characterized by uniform temperature gradients in a steady state prepared by heaters. However, although focusing laser beams on a magnetic film can form much larger temperature gradients, the laser irradiation method has not been sufficiently considered for quantifying the ANE coefficient due to the difficulty in estimating the localized in-homogeneous temperature gradients. In this study, we present a quantitative study of ANE in Ru(5 nm)/Co($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$) ($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$ = 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, and 60 nm) bilayers on sapphire (0001) substrates by combining a laser irradiation approach with finite element analysis of temperature gradients under laser excitation. We find that the estimated ANE coefficients are consistent with previously reported values and one independently characterized using a heater. Our results also reveal the advantages of the laser irradiation method over the conventional method using heaters. Intensity-modulated laser beams can create ac temperature gradients as large as approximately 10$^3$ K/mm at a frequency of tens of kilohertz in a micrometer-scale region.</p>

            <p>Spin fluctuations are an important issue for the design and operation of future spintronic devices. Femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) was recently applied to detect ultrafast magnetization fluctuations. FemNoC gives direct access to the spontaneous fluctuations of the magnetization in magnetically ordered materials. In FemNoC experiments, the magnetic fluctuations are imprinted on the polarization state of two independent femtosecond probe pulses upon transmission through a magnetic sample. Using a subharmonic demodulation scheme, the cross-correlation of the signals from both pulse trains is calculated. Here, we quantitatively link the FemNoC output signal to an optical polarization rotation, and then in turn to the magnitude of the inherent spin fluctuations. To this end, three different calibration protocols are presented and compared in accuracy. Ultimately, we quantitatively determine both the variance of optical polarization noise in rad$^2$, and that of the ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in (A/m)$^2$.</p>

            <p>The impact of Ge vacancies on the low-temperature lattice dynamics of single-crystalline GeTe was investigated through a comparative study of two off-stoichiometric samples: Ge$_{0.8}$Te (S$_1$) and Ge$_{0.88}$Te (S$_2$). X-ray diffraction confirms their highly oriented crystalline nature mainly along the $h0l$ plane, while temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals pronounced anharmonicity in S$_1$, indicated by stronger three-phonon scattering in the in-plane E-mode. A suppressed Raman feature at $~$ 239 $cm^{-1}$ in S$_2$ suggests fewer disordered GeTe$_{4-n}$Ge$_n$ tetrahedra, correlating with reduced Ge-Ge bonding signatures. Machine-Learned Molecular Dynamics (MLMD) simulations show dominant Te contributions below 100 $cm^{-1}$, while Ge dominates above, particularly influencing the 120 $cm^{-1}$ mode affected by defects at the Ge-site. Complementary calculation of phonon linewidth via MLMD and Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) methods affirm the predominance of three-phonon scattering below 300 K. Specific heat measurements, modeled using Debye-Einstein formalism, show lower Debye temperatures ($\theta_D$) of 172.3 $\pm$ 1.5 K in Ge$_{0.8}$Te and 176.6 $\pm$ 1.7 K for Ge$_{0.88}$Te respectively, confirming defect-induced lattice softening. Electrical resistivity analysis further corroborates this, indicating reduced effective phonon frequencies in $S_1$. Thus, our results establish that higher Ge vacancies lead to softer, and hence more anharmonic lattice dynamics in GeTe, with its relevance in designing superior thermoelectric and phase-change memory applications.</p>

            <h2>Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home when Doubled and Scaled</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Pierre Eckmann, Tsvi Tlusty</p>
            <p>The dynamics of numerous physical systems, such as spins and qubits, can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamran Behnia</p>
            <p>In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</p>

            <h2>Scaling laws of shrinkage induced fragmentation phenomena</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roland SzatmÃ¡ri, Akio Nakahara, So Kitsunezaki, Ferenc Kun</p>
            <p>We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of two-dimensional bond percolation. Our findings provide a novel insight into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industrial applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films or surface layers. However, real-world processing applications mostly are concerned with bulk materials, which prevents the use of x-ray surface based techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast x-ray dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon laser excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of thetemporal evolution of ultrafast distorted lattice depth profiles. We demonstrate the potential of UDD by studying a thin Si single crystal upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation. Our study reveals that below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions not only longitudinal, but also transversal to the propagation of the strain wave appear on picosecond time scales along the single crystal. The observation of this transversal deformation after laser excitation contradicts previous work that were not able to observed it, what could be related to the high sensitivity of dynamical diffraction with respect to the lattice distortions. The speed of propagation of this ultrafast transversal strain deformation is observed to be slower to the longitudinal sound speed for Si as described in the bibliography.</p>

            <h2>A controlled expansion for pairing in a polarized band with strong repulsion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Dong, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>Can strong repulsive interactions be shown to give rise to pairing in a controlled way? We find that for a single flavor polarized band, there is a small expansion parameter in the low density limit, once the Bloch wavefunction form factor is taken into account. A perturbative expansion is possible, even if the interaction is much stronger than the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$. As a matter of principle, our work shows analytically how strong pairing can emerge from strong repulsion. We illustrate our method with two examples: a 2D Dirac model and a 1D tight binding model with two orbitals. In the latter case, using density matrix renormalization group, we show that the analytical theory indeed guided us to discover the parameter regime where p-wave pairing with order-1 strength is dominant.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori</p>
            <p>It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has the desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors from several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation remain small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <p>We experimentally study the heterogeneity of strain in a granular medium subjected to oscillatory shear in a rotating drum. Two complementary methods are used. The first method relies on optical imaging and grain tracking, allowing us to compute some components of the strain tensor and their variance. The second method, Diffusive Acoustic Wave Spectroscopy (DAWS), provides the quadratic strain within the bulk. Our results show that strain is spatially heterogeneous, with fluctuations about ten times larger than the mean, primarily dominated by variability at the grain scale. We then analyze in detail the strain fluctuations occurring during the forward and backward branches of the shear stress cycles, along with the intra-cycle plastic strain resulting from of each cycle. Both methods reveal that each shear cycle consists of two consecutive diffusive-like branches, and that the resulting plastic strain fluctuations scales with the mean plastic shear strain. We propose that plastic strain fluctuations result from irreversible strain heterogeneity that increases with applied shear -- reflected in forward--backward strain anticorrelations -- but is constrained by load-controlled induced memory.</p>

            <p>The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques is revolutionizing materials discovery, property prediction, and material design by minimizing human intervention and accelerating scientific progress. This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies in this field include deep learning, graph neural networks, Bayesian optimization, and automated generative models (GANs, VAEs). These approaches enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (AutoGluon, TPOT, and this http URL), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, combining AI with automated experimentation and computational modeling is transforming the way materials are discovered and optimized.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Gisti, David J. Luitz, Maxime Debertolis</p>
            <p>We extend the concept of operator charge in the context of an abelian U (1) symmetry and apply this framework to symmetry-preserving matrix product operators (MPOs), enabling the description of operators projected onto specific sectors of the corresponding symmetry. Leveraging this representation, we study the effect of interactions on the scrambling of information in an integrable Heisenberg spin chain, by controlling the number of particles. Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.</p>

We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</p>

We then propose a new model incorporating paired-phase gradient interlayer interactions to realize the BKT paired phase. Moreover, we observe that the anomalous magnetic dimension varies along the phase transition line between the disordered normal phase and the BKT paired phase. This finding requires an understanding beyond the conventional phase transition theory.</p>

            <p>The interplay of quantum geometry and interactions determines the correlated state properties of flat bands. Here, we investigate the ideal quantum geometry (IQG), i.e., the property that the trace of quantum metric equals the Berry curvature, in the surface flat bands of rhombohedrally stacked graphene (RG) multilayers. We show that RG represents a class of semimetals with IQG, among which only RG has a nonvanishing IQG at the center of the surface bands. In the presence of long-range hoppings, a displacement field polarizes the electron density to one of the two surfaces, stabilizing the IQG and boosting transitions to correlated phases like superconductivity. Analyzing the superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state in a many-layer RG, we reveal a heavy-fermion picture where the "heavy electrons" carry a nonzero supercurrent. This unusual behavior arises from the IQG of the surface states, which suggests a large fraction of supercurrent running on the surface of RG.</p>

            <p>Characterising the statistical properties of classical interacting particle systems is a long-standing question. For Brownian particles the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean--Kawasaki equation. This equation remains mostly formal and linearization (or higher-order expansions) is required to obtain explicit expressions for physical observables, with a range of validity not easily defined. Here, by combining macroscopic fluctuation theory with equilibrium statistical mechanics, we provide a systematic alternative to the Dean--Kawasaki framework to characterize large-scale correlations. This approach enables us to obtain explicit and exact results for dynamical observables such as tracer cumulants and bath-tracer correlations in one dimension, both in and out of equilibrium. In particular, we reveal a generic non-monotonic spatial structure in the response of the bath following a temperature quench. Our approach applies to a broad class of interaction potentials and extends naturally to higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>Recently, a theoretical framework known as {\it ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory} has been developed to study large-scale fluctuations and correlations in many-body systems exhibiting ballistic transport. In this paper, we review this theory in the context of a one-dimensional gas of hard rods. The initial configurations of the rods are sampled from a probability distribution characterised by slowly varying conserved density profiles across this http URL from a microscopic description, we first formulate the macroscopic fluctuation theory in terms of the phase-space density of quasiparticles. In the second part, we apply this framework to compute the two-point, two-time correlation functions of the conserved densities in the Euler scaling limit. We derive an explicit expression for the correlation function which not only reveals its inherent symmetries, but is also straightforward to evaluate numerically for a given initial state. Our results also recover known expressions for space-time correlations in equilibrium for the hard-rod gas.</p>

            <h2>Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peiyi Chen, Qin Li, Gang Chen</p>
            <p>It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the cooling wall. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on an approximate quasi-continuum approach. This work examines this effect rigorously by studying evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Numerical results show that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, reaffirming the evaporative refrigeration effect. The present work further reveals that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. While the dominant mechanism is the asymmetry in the molecular distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules at the interface, additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion, similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. The impacts of key parameters, including liquid thickness, Knudsen number, and accommodation coefficient, are investigated. The numerical simulation shows that with a thicker vapor, a thinner liquid film, and a larger accommodation coefficient, leads to stronger evaporative refrigeration effect. This work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning, refrigeration, and membrane distillation.</p>

After the driving is turned off, this parameter exhibits a clear decay, which enabled us to identify a characteristic relaxation time. Interestingly, this timescale remains nearly constant across the range of excitation amplitudes explored, while the magnitude of $\delta$ varies with the injected energy. Numerical simulations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal a qualitatively similar behavior, both showing a decay of density variations over time.</p>

Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology.

In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</p>

One approach to addressing this issue, referred to as the hierarchical multiscale method, is to use a high-fidelity fine-grained model to compute the closure terms needed by the coarse-grained model. The difficulty with this approach is that the overall model can become computationally intractable due to the high computational cost of the high-fidelity model. In this work, we describe a multiscale modeling approach for dense granular flows that utilizes neural networks trained using high-fidelity discrete element method (DEM) simulations to approximate the constitutive granular rheology for a continuum incompressible flow model. Our approach leverages an ensemble of neural networks to estimate predictive uncertainty that allows us to determine whether the rheology at a given point is accurately represented by the neural network model. Additional DEM simulations are only performed when needed, minimizing the number of additional DEM simulations required when updating the rheology. This adaptive coupling significantly reduces the overall computational cost of the approach while controlling the error. In addition, the neural networks are customized to learn regularized rheological behavior to ensure well-posedness of the continuum solution. We first validate the approach using two-dimensional steady-state and decelerating inclined flows. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by modeling three-dimensional sub-aerial granular column collapse for varying initial column aspect ratios, where our multiscale method compares well with the computationally expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-DEM simulation.</p>

            <h2>Phonon, Infrared and Raman Spectra of LiGa5O8 from Density Functional Perturbation Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarker Md. Sadman, Walter R. L. Lambrecht</p>
            <p>LiGa$_5$O$_8$ with a cubic spinel type structure was recently reported to be a ultra-wide-band-gap semiconductor with unintentional p-type conduction. While the origin of p-type doping is still unclear, the fundamental properties of this material are of interest. Here we present a first-principles study of the phonons using density functional perturbation theory. The phonon band structures show no unstable modes verifying the stability of the structure. We focus mainly on the phonons at the Brillouin zone center for which a full symmetry analysis is presented. We present the dielectric function contributions from the infrared active modes as well as the Raman spectra and their polarization dependence. The phonon density of states integrated over the Brillouin zone is also presented as this may related to disordered Raman spectra.</p>

            <p>We describe an apparatus that efficiently produces $^{23}$Na Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a hybrid trap that combines a quadrupole magnetic field with a far-detuned optical dipole trap. Using a Bayesian optimization framework, we systematically optimize all BEC production parameters in modest sized batches of highly correlated parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier-based technique to optimize the duration of different evaporation stages constrained to have a fixed total duration; this enables the progressive creation of increasingly rapid experimental sequences that still generate high quality BECs. Taken together, our techniques constitute a general approach for refining and accelerating sequence-based experimental protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Zhang, Shashi Mishra, Elena R. Margine, Emmanouil Kioupakis</p>
            <p>Boron forms a wide variety of compounds with alkaline earth elements due to its unique bonding characteristics. Among these, binary compounds of Be and B display particularly rich structural diversity, attributed to the small atomic size of Be. Cubic BeB$_2$ is a particularly interesting phase, where Be donates electrons to stabilize a diamond-like boron network under high pressure. In this work, we employ \textit{ab initio} methods to conduct a detailed investigation of cubic BeB$_2$ and its functional properties. We show that this metastable phase is dynamically stable under ambient conditions, and its lattice match to existing substrate materials suggests possible epitaxial stabilization via thin-film growth routes. Through a comprehensive characterization of its electronic, transport, and superconductivity properties, we demonstrate that cubic BeB$_2$ exhibits high hole concentrations and high hole mobility, making it a potential candidate for efficient $p$-type transport. In addition, cubic BeB$_2$ is found to exhibit low-temperature superconductivity at degenerate doping levels, similar to several other doped covalent semiconductors such as diamond, Si, and SiC.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the anisotropic dispersion features of a two dimensional electron gas at the (110) oriented $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interfaces, as revealed by scanning gate microscopy of electronic flow from a quantum point contact. The dispersion relation of the (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interface is characterized by a highly non-circular Fermi surface. Here, we develop an efficient tight-binding model for the electron gas at the interface. We show that the anisotropy of the Fermi surface causes both the direction of the electron flux from the quantum point contact and the periodicity of the self-interference conductance fringes to depend strongly on the orientation of the constriction relative to the crystal lattice. We show that the radially non-uniform distribution of the Fermi velocity on the Fermi surface results in skewing of electron trajectories when the quantum point contact gates are not aligned with the in-plane primitive vectors. We show that this effect results in the separation of electrons belonging to different orbitals for wide (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ quantum wells.</p>

            <h2>Role of interaction anisotropy in polymer cononsolvency: insights from the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satyen Dhamankar, Michael A. Webb</p>
            <p>Cononsolvency occurs when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for polymers over specific composition ranges, causing macroscopic phase separation or microscopic chain collapse. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between macroscopic and microscopic manifestations of cononsolvency remains unclear. A key challenge is identifying which interactions govern cononsolvency: coarse-grained analyses like standard Flory--Huggins models assume purely isotropic interactions, while atomistic simulations contain complex anisotropic interactions that cannot be precisely controlled or isolated. Here, we address the role of interaction anisotropy using the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework, which yields $\chi$ as a thermodynamic average over both configurational and internal-state coarse-grained degrees of freedom. This enables controlled comparison between systems with isotropic versus orientation-dependent interactions that share identical effective $\chi$ parameters, either driving cononsolvency by strong solvent-cosolvent affinity or preferential polymer-cosolvent affinity. While pairs of systems exhibit equivalent macroscopic phase behavior, lattice Monte Carlo simulations reveal that those featuring orientation-dependent interactions generate distinct collapse signatures, particularly in reentrant coil-globule transitions or characteristics of the solvation structure. These results demonstrate how microscopic interactions influences cononsolvency behavior beyond what effective $\chi$ parameters alone predict.</p>

            <h2>FeTaX2: A ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yadong Jiang, Huan Wang, Jing Wang</p>
            <p>We propose that the van der Waals layered ternary transition metal chalcogenides FeTa$X_2$ ($X=$ S, Se, Te) as a new family of ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulators with a sizable bulk gap and high Chern number $C=-2$. The magnetic order arises primarily from Fe atoms, whose strong ferromagnetic exchange induces moments on neighboring Ta sites. The large topological gap originates from a \emph{deep} $s$-$d$-type band inversion between spin-down Ta $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xy}$ orbitals near the Fermi level-a mechanism unique to $d$-orbital systems. Remarkably, the Curie temperature of monolayer FeTa$X_2$ is predicted to significantly exceed that of monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Furthermore, both the Curie temperature and topological gap scale positively with the spin-orbit coupling strength of the $d$ electrons, suggesting a common physical origin. Owing to its structural similarity to Fe$X$ superconductors and reduced net magnetization, FeTa$X_2$ further offers a promising platform for realizing chiral topological superconductivity. These findings, if realized experimentally, could open new avenues for the research and application of topological quantum physics.</p>

            <h2>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakob Metson, Saeed Osat, Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakob Metson, Saeed Osat, Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakash Sharma, Luogen Xu, Fei Xue, Yao Wang</p>
            <p>Resonant spectroscopies, which involve intermediate states with finite lifetimes, provide essential insights into collective excitations in quantum materials that are otherwise inaccessible. However, theoretical understanding in this area is often limited by the numerical challenges of solving Kramers-Heisenberg-type response functions for large-scale systems. To address this, we introduce a multi-shifted biconjugate gradient algorithm that exploits the shared structure of Krylov subspaces across spectra with varying incident energies, effectively reducing the computational complexity to that of linear spectroscopies. Both mathematical proofs and numerical benchmarks confirm that this algorithm substantially accelerates spectral simulations, achieving constant complexity independent of the number of incident energies, while ensuring accuracy and stability. This development provides a scalable, versatile framework for simulating advanced spectroscopies in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Infinite randomness criticality and localization of the floating phase in arrays of Rydberg atoms trapped with non-perfect tweezers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Soto-Garcia, Natalia Chepiga</p>
            <p>Chains of Rydberg atoms have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring low-dimensional quantum physics. This success originates from the precise control of lattice geometries provided by optical tweezers, which allows access to a wide range of synthetic quantum phases. Experiments on one-dimensional arrays have stimulated tremendous progress in understanding quantum phase transitions into crystalline phases. However, the finite width of tweezers introduces small variations in interatomic distances, leading to quenched disorder in the interactions. In this letter, we numerically study how such disorder alters the nature of two critical regimes observed in experiments. Firstly, following experimental protocols, we analyze Kibble-Zurek dynamics and find a crossover from the clean Ising transition to the infinite-randomness fixed point as system size and disorder strength increase. Secondly, we show that the floating phase (an incommensurate Luttinger liquid phase emerging at stronger interactions) is localized by the disorder, yet preserves short-range incommensurate correlations with the same leading wave vector. Our results clearly reveal an additional technical challenge in the scalability of Rydberg-based quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Transverse thermoelectric effects interconvert charge and heat currents in orthogonal directions due to the breaking of either time-reversal symmetry or structural symmetry, enabling simple and versatile thermal energy harvesting and solid-state cooling/heating within single materials. In comparison to the complex module structures required for the conventional Seebeck and Peltier effects, the transverse thermoelectric effects provide the complete device structures, potentially resolving the fundamental issue of multi-module degradation of thermoelectric conversion performance. This review article provides an overview of all currently known transverse thermoelectric conversion phenomena and principles, as well as their characteristics, and reclassifies them in a unified manner. The performance of the transverse thermoelectric generator, refrigerator, and active cooler is formulated, showing that thermal boundary conditions play an essential role in discussion on their behaviors. Examples of recent application research and material development in transverse thermoelectrics are also introduced, followed by a discussion of future prospects.</p>

            <p>Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a theory that describes the time evolution of quantum mechanical many-electron systems under the influence of external time-dependent electric and magnetic fields. INQ is a specially designed software to efficiently solve the real-time TDDFT equations on graphics processing units (GPUs), which aim to overcome the computational limitation of time and size scales of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. In this work we will present an implementation of non-collinear TDDFT for the INQ code to simulate spin dynamics in real time and discuss the implementation of non-collinear magnetic effects into the code. We will discuss the implementation of exchange-correlation magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling, and the interaction between the electronic system and external magnetic fields. We will then consider several prototypical examples of spin dynamics in magnetic clusters and solids after light excitation. Potential applications range from the study of real-time dynamics of magnons to ultrafast spin dynamics under linear and circularly polarized laser excitation, as well as spectroscopic signatures such as magnetic circular dichroism and pump-probe Kerr rotation.</p>

            <p>We report the development of an instrument combining an ultrafast, high-repetition-rate, polarization-tunable monochromatic extreme ultraviolet (XUV, 21.6 eV) beamline and a next-generation momentum microscope endstation. This setup enables time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of quantum materials, offering multimodal photoemission dichroism capabilities. The momentum microscope simultaneously detects the full surface Brillouin zone over an extended binding energy range. It is equipped with advanced electron optics, including a new type of front lens that supports multiple operational modes. Enhanced spatial resolution is achieved by combining the small XUV beam footprint (33 $\mu$m by 45 $\mu$m) with the selection of small regions of interest using apertures positioned in the Gaussian plane of the momentum microscope. This instrument achieves an energy resolution of 44 meV and a temporal resolution of 144 fs. We demonstrate the capability to perform linear, Fourier, and circular dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions from photoexcited 2D materials.

            <p>The cuprate pseudogap phase displays Fermi arc spectral weight in photoemission and scanning tunneling microscopy, while recent magnetotransport observations yield evidence for the existence of hole pockets of fractional area $p/8$, where $p$ is the doping density. We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We predict that quantum oscillations of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates in regimes with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order.</p>

            <p>We revisit the relationship between electric polarization modulation $\Delta P$ in ferroelectrics induced by a low-frequency pulsed electric field and the corresponding second harmonic intensity modulation $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Using nonlinear response theory, we derive their time-domain expressions linear in the pulse amplitude, revealing that not only the electric field but also its time derivative contributes to $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Furthermore, even when the time-derivative component is negligible, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can be in antiphase with the pulsed field and thus with $\Delta P$. These theoretical predictions are further supported by real-time simulations of a model for electronic ferroelectrics. Our results demonstrate that the commonly assumed relation $\Delta P \propto \Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can break down under certain conditions, reflecting the complex-valued and frequency-dependent nature of nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities.</p>

Recently, its versatility was extended to SU(N) Hubbard model, where the core is a novel dynamical programming approach to the summation of all connected Feynman diagrams.

The framework treats SU(N) symmetry breaking both from nonuniform, flavor-dependent chemical potentials and from spontaneously broken phases induced by shift parameters. We also provide an end-to-end GPU acceleration path with dedicated CUDA C++ optimizations independent of a previous CUDA acceleration approach, where the parallelization strategy is different. We performed detailed numerical study of new algorithms involved in this article and exposed numerical instabilities of connected determinant formalism, which we solved in multiple ways.

            <p>Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</p>

Breaking the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, which connects magnetic sublattices, induces a transition to a quantum anomalous Hall state. We further establish a strain-induced mechanism to control these topological phase transitions and present the corresponding phase diagram. Finally, we demonstrate the predicted transitions in monolayer CrO, a realistic altermagnetic candidate, using first-principles calculations.

EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1% error), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems. Building on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model covering the periodic table. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot performance across diverse systems, and generalizes beyond the training distribution, supporting downstream applications such as band structure calculations.
