            <h2>A shear-induced limit on bacterial surface adhesion in fluid flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edwina F. Yeo, Benjamin J. Walker, Philip Pearce, Mohit P. Dalwadi</p>
            <p>Controlling bacterial surface adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation in fluid systems is crucial for the safety and efficacy of medical and industrial processes. Here, we theoretically examine the transport of bacteria close to surfaces, isolating how the key processes of bacterial motility and fluid flow interact and alter surface adhesion. We exploit the disparity between the fluid velocity and the swimming velocity of common motile bacteria and, using a hybrid asymptotic-computational approach, we systematically derive the coarse-grained bacterial diffusivity close to surfaces as a function of swimming speed, rotational diffusivity, and shape. We calculate an analytical upper bound for the bacterial adhesion rate by considering the scenario in which bacteria adhere irreversibly to the surface on first contact. Our theory predicts that maximal adhesion occurs at intermediate flow rates: at low flow rates, increasing flow increases surface adhesion, while at higher flow rates, adhesion is decreased by shear-induced cell reorientation.</p>

            <h2>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jessica Kaijia Jiang, Federica Maria Surace, Olexei I. Motrunich</p>
            <p>The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-André models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-André models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical correlation functions for the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin zu Münster, Florian Gebhard, Satoshi Ejima, Holger Fehske</p>
            <p>We calculate the dynamical current and kinetic-energy correlation functions for the first Mott lobe of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. We employ the strong-coupling expansion up to sixth order in $x=t/U$, and the dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method on rings with 64 sites. The correlation functions are finite above the single-particle gap with a square-root onset, as is also found from field theory close to the Mott transition. The correlation functions display a featureless superposition of the primary and tertiary Hubbard bands. We find very good agreement between all methods in the interaction/frequency regimes where they are applicable.</p>

            <h2>Electrostatics in semiconducting devices II : Solving the Helmholtz equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio Lacerda-Santos, Xavier Waintal</p>
            <p>The convergence of iterative schemes to achieve self-consistency in mean field problems such as the Schrödinger-Poisson equation is notoriously capricious. It is particularly difficult in regimes where the non-linearities are strong such as when an electron gas in partially depleted or in presence of a large magnetic field. Here, we address this problem by mapping the self-consistent quantum-electrostatic problem onto a Non-Linear Helmoltz (NLH) equation at the cost of a small error. The NLH equation is a generalization of the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We show that one can build iterative schemes that are provably convergent by constructing a convex functional whose minimum is the seeked solution of the NLH problem. In a second step, the approximation is lifted and the exact solution of the initial problem found by iteratively updating the NLH problem until convergence. We show empirically that convergence is achieved in a handfull, typically one or two, iterations. Our set of algorithms provide a robust, precise and fast scheme for studying the effect of electrostatics in quantum nanoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantics Tensor Train for solving Gross-Pitaevskii equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleix Bou-Comas, Marcin Płodzień, Luca Tagliacozzo, Juan José García-Ripoll</p>
            <p>We present a quantum-inspired solver for the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the Quantics Tensor-Train (QTT) representation. By evolving the system entirely within a low-rank tensor manifold, the method sidesteps the memory and runtime barriers that limit conventional finite-difference and spectral schemes. Two complementary algorithms are developed: an imaginary-time projector that drives the condensate toward its variational ground state and a rank-adapted fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator for real-time dynamics. The framework captures a broad range of physical scenarios - including barrier-confined condensates, quasi-random potentials, long-range dipolar interactions, and multicomponent spinor dynamics - without leaving the compressed representation. Relative to standard discretizations, the QTT approach achieves an exponential reduction in computational resources while retaining quantitative accuracy, thereby extending the practicable regime of Gross-Pitaevskii simulations on classical hardware. These results position tensor networks as a practical bridge between high-performance classical computing and prospective quantum hardware for the numerical treatment of nonlinear Schrodinger-type partial differential equations.</p>

            <h2>Mapping phase diagrams of quantum spin systems through semidefinite-programming relaxations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Jansen, Donato Farina, Luke Mortimer, Timothy Heightman, Andreas Leitherer, Pere Mujal, Jie Wang, Antonio Acín</p>
            <p>Identifying quantum phase transitions poses a significant challenge in condensed matter physics, as this requires methods that both provide accurate results and scale well with system size. In this work, we demonstrate how relaxation methods can be used to generate the phase diagram for one- and two-dimensional quantum systems. To do so, we formulate a relaxed version of the ground-state problem as a semidefinite program, which we can solve efficiently. Then, by taking the resulting vector of operator monomials for different model parameters, we identify all first- and second-order transitions based on their cosine similarity. Furthermore, we show how spontaneous symmetry breaking is naturally captured by bounding the corresponding observable. Using these methods, we reproduce the phase transitions for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and the two-dimensional frustrated bilayer Heisenberg model. We also illustrate how the phase diagram of the latter changes when a next-nearest-neighbor interaction is introduced. Overall, our work demonstrates how relaxation methods provide a novel framework for studying and understanding quantum phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Quasiparticle energies and excitonic effects of α-RuCl3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Du Li, Li Yang</p>
            <p>{\alpha}-phase Ruthenium (III) chloride ({\alpha}-RuCl3) has attracted significant attention because of its potential for realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquid. In this work, we employ first-principles many-body perturbation theory to study its many-electron interactions and excited-state properties. We find enhanced many-electron interactions that dominate quasiparticle energies and optical responses in {\alpha}-RuCl3. Our calculated quasiparticle band gap of bulk structure is about 1.75 eV that agrees well with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, our calculated first and second primary bright excitons are located at 1.23 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively. These excitons show good consistency with the main features observed in the optical absorption spectrum. We extend our investigation to monolayer {\alpha}-RuCl3, examining the zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases. In addition to significant excitonic effects, the optical spectrum of the zigzag AFM phase exhibits anisotropic behavior, while the FM phase demonstrates isotropic characteristics. The different optical response behaviors provide an efficient approach to identify the energy nearly degenerate magnetic states, which can both potentially exist in fabricated samples.</p>

            <h2>Effective anisotropic interaction potentials for pairs of ultracold molecules shielded by a static electric field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bijit Mukherjee, Luis Santos, Jeremy M. Hutson</p>
            <p>Quantum gases of ultracold polar molecules have novel properties because of the strong dipolar forces between molecules. Current experiments shield the molecules from destructive collisions by engineering long-range repulsive interactions using microwave or static electric fields. These shielding methods produce interaction potentials with large repulsive cores that are not well described with contact potentials. In this paper we explore the anisotropic interaction potentials that arise for pairs of polar molecules shielded with static electric fields. We derive computationally inexpensive approximations for the potentials that are suitable for use in calculations of many-body properties. The interaction potentials for molecules shielded with static fields are qualitatively different from those that arise from single-field microwave shielding and will produce quite different many-body physics.</p>

            <h2>Determining the complex second-order optical susceptibility in macroscale van der Waals heterobilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyuan Zhu, Taejun Yoo, Kanchan Shaikh, Amalya C. Johnson, Qiuyang Li, Fang Liu, Hui Deng, Yuki Kobayashi</p>
            <p>We report on the experimental characterization of the second-order susceptibility in MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayers, including their hidden complex phases. To this end, we developed a heterodyne-detection scheme for second-harmonic generation and applied it to macroscale heterobilayer samples prepared using the gold-tape exfoliation method. The heterodyne scheme enabled us to distinguish the relative orientation of the crystal domains, and further, it allowed us to characterize the complex phases of the susceptibility relative to a reference quartz sample. By comparing the results from the monolayer regions and the heterobilayer region over several hundred microns of the sample area, we determined that the contribution of interlayer effects to second-harmonic generation is within the experimental uncertainty arising from the sample inhomogeneity. The results here provide fundamental quantitative information necessary for the precise design of nanophotonic systems based on stacking engineering.</p>

            <p>Recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity on multilayer nickelates under high pressure have stimulated great interest. The magnetic and charge configurations in the normal phase of multilayer nickelates which closely relate to the spin-charge fluctuations remain under strongly debated. In this work, we focus the normal-state magnetic, charge and orbital configurations and its evolutions with hydrostatic pressure and Sr-doping concentration of monolayer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$. We reveal that in the ambient pressure tetragonal La2NiO4 displays Neel-type antiferromagnetic order in planer Ni spins with negligible interlayer magnetic coupling; with the increase of pressure, La2NiO4 evolves from insulate into metallic state with the critical pressure about P = 50 GPa; with the substitution of La by Sr, the magnetic ground state evolves from G-type, A-type, to double spin striped antiferromagnetic states, as well as weak charge and orbital orders, at x=1; These results can greatly promote our understanding of the magnetic properties of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, and shed the light of the pairing mechanism of unconventional nickelate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of topological Kondo insulating state in MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongdong Han, Yiyu Xia, Zhengchao Xia, Wenjin Zhao, Yichi Zhang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jie Shan, Kin Fai Mak</p>
            <p>Topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) are topologically protected insulating states induced not by single-particle band inversions, but by the Kondo interaction between itinerant electrons and a lattice of local magnetic moments. Although experiments have suggested the emergence of three-dimensional (3D) TKIs in the rare earth compound SmB6, its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart has not been demonstrated to date. Here we report experimental evidence of a TKI in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which support a Kondo lattice with topologically nontrivial Kondo interactions. We prepare in a dual-gated device a triangular lattice Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer Kondo-coupled to a half-filled itinerant band in the WSe2 layer. Combined transport and compressibility measurements show that the prepared state supports metallic transport at high temperatures and, at low temperatures, an insulating bulk with conducting helical edge states protected by spin-Sz conservation. The presence of Kondo singlets is further evidenced by their breakdown at high magnetic fields. Such behaviors are in stark contrast to the simple metallic state when the Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer is depleted by gating. Our results open the door for exploring tunable topological Kondo physics in moiré materials.</p>

            <p>When thinned down to just a few atomic layers, the layered magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 offers an exceptional platform for exploring a wide range of topological phenomena. In this work, we overcome longstanding challenges in synthesizing high-purity MnBi2Te4 crystals and report the observation of a myriad of quantized topological states in high-quality five-septuple-layer (5-SL) samples under magnetic fields up to 45 Tesla. We show that the nontrivial topology of 5-SL MnBi2Te4, in the presence of Landau quantization, is governed by a generalized topological index rooted in the parity anomaly of Dirac fermions in (2+1) dimensions. The anomaly manifests as an anomalous Landau level, giving rise to gate-tunable helical edge transport. Our results establish high-quality MnBi2Te4 as a robust platform for exploring emergent topological states and for advancing novel quantum device applications.</p>

            <h2>Polariton transport in 2D semiconductors: Phonon-mediated transitions between ballistic, superdiffusive and exciton-limited regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jamie M. Fitzgerald, Roberto Rosati, Ermin Malic</p>
            <p>Exciton transport in 2D semiconductors holds promise for room-temperature, ultra-compact optoelectronic devices, but it is limited by short propagation distances. Hybridization of excitons with cavity photons to form exciton-polaritons can enhance the propagation by orders of magnitude, enabling a coherent, ballistic transport. However, a microscopic understanding of the role of phonons is still lacking, particularly regarding their influence on the crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive polariton transport regime. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal polariton dynamics in \ce{MoSe2} monolayers at moderate to high temperatures, explicitly including the phonon-mediated coupling to the intervalley exciton reservoir. We identify three distinct transport regimes: (i) an initial sub-ps ballistic-like regime characterized by a phonon-induced velocity renormalization, (ii) a transient, few-ps superdiffusive regime characterized by strongly enhanced diffusion, and (iii) a slower, exciton-limited diffusion following thermalization. The gained microscopic insights will trigger and guide future experimental studies on the phonon-mediated polariton transport in atomically thin semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Ferroelectrically Switchable Half-Quantized Hall Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. U. Muzaffar, Kai-Zhi Bai, Wei Qin, Guohua Cao, Bo Fu, Ping Cui, Shun-Qing Shen, Zhenyu Zhang</p>
            <p>Integrating ferroelectricity, antiferromagnetism, and topological quantum transport within a single material is rare, but crucial for developing next-generation quantum devices. Here, we propose a multiferroic heterostructure consisting of an antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer and an Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film is able to harbor the half-quantized Hall (HQH) effect with a ferroelectrically switchable Hall conductivity of $e^2/2h$. We first show that, in the energetically stable configuration, the antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer opens a gap in the top surface bands of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ through proximity effect, while its bottom surface bands remain gapless; consequently, HQH conductivity of $e^2/2h$ can be sustained clockwise or counterclockwise depending on antiferromagnetic configuration of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Remarkably, when applying interlayer sliding within the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer, its electric polarization direction associated with parity-time reversal symmetry breaking is reversed, accompanied by a reversal of the HQH conductivity. The proposed approach offers a powerful route to control topological quantum transport in antiferromagnetic materials by ferroelectricity.</p>

            <h2>On-Device Control of Electronic Friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaokuan Yu, Jinbo Bian, Jin Wang, Zonghuiyi Jiang, Linxin Zhai, Xin Lu, Xiaofei Liu, Quanshui Zheng, Zhiping Xu</p>
            <p>Friction causes mechanical energy dissipation and material degradation in machinery and devices. While phononic friction is well understood via anharmonic lattice dynamics, the physics of electronic friction remains unclear due to challenges in separating electronic degrees of freedom from phononic ones in experiments and analyzing the non-equilibrium interactions between ionic movement and electronic dynamics in theory. To tackle this problem, we construct a sliding device featuring 2D crystalline interfaces that possess ultra-smooth and minimally interacting surfaces, achieving the state of structural superlubricity with no wear and minimal friction. Using electrical and mechanical controls, we tuned the nature of interfacial electronic coupling and charge densities in materials in an on-device setting, which allows us to disentangle the electron and phonon contributions to friction. Our experimental data and theoretical analysis supported by first-principles calculations demonstrate that electronic friction can well surpass phononic contributions and dominate energy dissipation at structural superlubricity contacts. These findings offer fresh insights into the mechanism of electronic friction and promising opportunities for friction control in device applications.</p>

            <h2>Prediction of High-Temperature Half Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in a Semi-magnetic Topological Insulator of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. U. Muzaffar, Kai-Zhi Bai, Wei Qin, Guohua Cao, Yutong Yang, Shunhong Zhang, Ping Cui, Shun-Qing Shen, Zhenyu Zhang</p>
            <p>The classic Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs theorem dictates that a single electron band of a lattice can only harbor an integer quantum Hall conductance as a multiple of e^2/2h, while recent studies have pointed to the emergence of half quantum anomalous Hall (HQAH) effect, though the underlying microscopic mechanisms remain controversial. Here we propose an ideal platform of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$ that allows not only to realize the HQAH effect at much higher temperatures, but also to critically assess the different contributions of the gapped and gapless Dirac bands. We first show that the top surface bands of the Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film become gapped, while the bottom surface bands remain gapless due to proximity coupling with the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ overlayer. Next we show that such a semi-magnetic topological insulator harbors the HQAH effect at ~20 K, with Cr doping enhancing it to as high as 67 K, driven by large magnetic anisotropy and strong magnetic coupling constants that raise the Curie temperature. Our detailed Berry curvature analysis further helps to reveal that, whereas the gapped surface bands can contribute to the Hall conductance when the chemical potential is tuned to overlap with the bands, these bands have no net contribution when the chemical potential is in the gapped region, leaving the gapless bands to be the sole contributor to the HQAH conductance. Counterintuitively, the part of the gapless bands within the gapped region of the top surface bands have no net contribution, thereby ensuring the plateau nature of the Hall conductance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aastha Jain, Dheeraj Kumar Singh</p>
            <p>We explore the nonreciprocity of spin-wave excitations in the Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnet within the random-phase approximation. We find that the non-reciprocal behavior arises only when the magnetic moments are aligned in-plane and not out-of-plane. Furthermore, the spin-wave excitations exhibit non-reciprocal behavior in a direction in the momentum space reciprocal to an in-plane direction perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic moments. In that case, the first dominating term in the low-energy dispersion is linear. However, if the magnetic moments are out-of-plane, then the first dominant term is quadratic instead. The low-energy non-quadratic behavior is examined in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime for various strengths of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <p>Transient size segregation of a bi-disperse granular mixture flowing over a periodic chute is studied using the Discrete Element Method and continuum simulations. A recently developed particle force-based size segregation model is used to predict the time-dependent flow properties of binary mixtures starting from rest. A two-way coupled continuum model that solves the momentum balance and convection-diffusion equations by incorporating the mixture segregation model along with the generalized inertial number-based rheological model is developed for predicting the evolution of segregation. The predicted concentration profiles and other flow properties of the mixture are found to be in good agreement with the DEM data for a variety of compositions. The evolution of the centre of mass of the two species with time is also very well captured for different initial configurations and size ratios using the particle force-based segregation model.</p>

            <p>Understanding thermal properties of materials is fundamental to technological applications and to discover new phenomena. In particular, advances of experimental techniques such as cold-atoms measurements allow the simulation of paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the Fermi-Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the behavior of the specific heat as function of density. In this work, we perform Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model to analyze the specific heat as the filling, interaction and temperature of the system is changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential contributions to the specific heat. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atoms experiments. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign. Moreover, our specific heat results demonstrate interesting phenomena away from the commonly studied half-filling regime.</p>

            <p>Topological materials occupy a frontier in condensed-matter physics thanks to their remarkable electronic and quantum properties, yet their cross-scale design remains bottlenecked by inefficient discovery workflows. Here, we introduce TopoMAS (Topological materials Multi-Agent System), an interactive human-AI framework that seamlessly orchestrates the entire materials-discovery pipeline: from user-defined queries and multi-source data retrieval, through theoretical inference and crystal-structure generation, to first-principles validation. Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses twice as fast as Qwen3-235B. This efficiency establishes TopoMAS as an accelerator for computation-driven discovery pipelines.

            <h2>Characterization of fractional Chern insulator quasiparticles in moiré transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Liu, Bohao Li, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>We provide a detailed study of Abelian quasiparticles of valley polarized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) residing in the top valence band of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) at hole filling $\nu_h=2/3$. We construct a tight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy dispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by short-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the localized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the impurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI quasiparticle localized at moiré lattice center closely follows the anyon Wannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite of the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around the impurity potential for the $\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar to that of the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length on the moiré lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough estimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the impurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as expected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of fractional statistics. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top valence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI quasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around a quasiparticle. We also discuss the effect of band mixing on FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Momentum-Band Topology in PT-Symmetric acoustic Floquet Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuaishuai Tong, Qicheng Zhang, Gaohan Li, Kun Zhang, Chun Xie, Chunyin Qiu</p>
            <p>Momentum-band topology, which transcends conventional topological band theory, unlocks new topological phases that host fascinating temporal interface states. However, direct bulk experimental evidence of such emerging band topology is still lacking due to the great challenges in resolving eigenstates and topological invariants of time-varying systems. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the momentum-band topology in a PT-symmetric Floquet lattice, where the drive-induced momentum gap can be characterized by a quantized Berry phase in the energy Brillouin zone. Experimentally, we synthesize the Floquet lattice model using an acoustic cavity-tube structure coupled to custom-designed external circuits. By reconstructing the effective Hamiltonian, we extract the system's eigenstates and provide the first bulk evidence of momentum-band topology from the perspectives of band inversion and topological invariants. This is accompanied by an unambiguous observation of time-localized interface states in real physical time, thereby providing the boundary signature of the bulk topology. Our work paves the way for further experimental studies on the burgeoning momentum-gap physics.</p>

            <h2>Time-Dependent Oxidative Degradation of WSe2 Nanosheets and Its Influence on HER Catalysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panwad Chavalekvirat, Wisit Hirunpinyopas, Pawin Iamprasertkun</p>
            <p>The selection of an appropriate solvent has long been a critical factor in the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (2D TMD) nanosheets. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) remains one of the most commonly used solvents due to its favourable surface tension compatibility, particularly with tungsten diselenide (WSe2), which facilitates a relatively high yield of exfoliated nanosheets. However, prolonged exposure of the nanosheets to NMP promotes oxidation, consequently diminishing their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In contrast, a more environmentally friendly solvent system, consisting of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionised water (DI), induces significantly less oxidation and results in enhanced HER performance. Notably, this green solvent system achieves the lowest overpotential of 0.209 V vs RHE after 24 hours of chronoamperometry.</p>

            <h2>Absence of higher than 6-fold coordination in glassy $GeO_{2}$ up to 158 GPa revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João Elias F. S. Rodrigues, Angelika D. Rosa, Emin Mijit, Tetsuo Irifune, Gaston Garbarino, Olivier Mathon, Raffaella Torchio, Max Wilke</p>
            <p>Simple binary oxide glasses can exhibit a compression behavior distinct from that of their crystalline counterparts. In this study, we employed high-pressure X-ray absorption spectroscopy coupled to the diamond anvil cell to investigate in detail local structural changes around Ge in glassy $GeO_{2}$ up to 158 GPa. We conducted four independent runs, both with and without pressure-transmitting media. Up to 30 GPa, we observed no significant influence of the pressure medium on the pressure dependence of the $Ge-O$ bond length ($<R_{Ge-O}>$). Between 10 and 30 GPa, the evolution of $<R_{Ge-O}>$ shows substantial variability across our experiments and previous works. The measured values lie close to those reported for crystalline polymorphs, including the rutile- and $CaCl_{2}$-type phase of $GeO_{2}$. This finding suggests that the amorphous structure possesses considerable flexibility to transition among different atomic configurations. From 30 GPa to 158 GPa, our results for both $<R_{Ge-O}>$ and the non-bonded cation-cation distance $<R_{Ge...Ge}>$ demonstrate that edge-sharing octahedra remain the main structural motives in glassy $GeO_{2}$. Up to 100 GPa, compaction proceeds primarily via distortions of octahedral $O-Ge-O$ bond angles accompanied by octahedral bond shortening. Above 100 GPa, octahedral distortion becomes the prevailing mechanism. Compared to its crystalline analogues ($\alpha-PbO_{2}$ and pyrite-like phase), glassy $GeO_{2}$ exhibits a slightly less efficient compaction mechanism, likely due to kinetic constraints that inhibit reconstructive lattice rearrangements.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic Origins of Conformable Dynamics: From Disorder to Deformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Weberszpil</p>
            <p>Conformable derivatives have attracted increasing interest for bridging classical and fractional calculus while retaining analytical tractability. However, their physical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we provide a systematic derivation of conformable relaxation dynamics from microscopic principles. Starting from a spatially-resolved Ginzburg-Landau framework with quenched disorder and temperature-dependent kinetic coefficients, we demonstrate how spatial heterogeneity and energy barrier distributions give rise to emergent power-law memory kernels. In the adiabatic limit, these kernels reduce to a conformable temporal structure of the form T^{1-\mu}\,d\psi/dT. The deformation parameter \mu is shown to be connected to experimentally measurable properties such as transport coefficients, disorder statistics, and relaxation time spectra. This formulation also reveals a natural link with nonextensive thermodynamics and Tsallis entropy. By unifying memory effects, anomalous relaxation, and spatial correlations under a coherent physical mechanism, our framework transforms conformable derivatives from heuristic tools into physically grounded operators suitable for modeling complex critical dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. R. Parymuda</p>
            <p>We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta>1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.</p>

            <h2>Effective behavior of heterogeneous media governed by strain gradient elasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harkirat Singh, Mayank Raj, Kaushik Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>Various mechanical phenomena depend on the length scale, and these have inspired a variety of nonlocal and higher gradient continuum theories. Mechanistically, it is believed that the length scale dependence arises due to an interplay between the length scale of heterogeneities in the material, the length scale of the material being probed and the phenomenon under study. In this paper, we seek to understand this interplay in a simple setting by studying the overall behavior of a one-dimensional periodic medium governed by strain gradient elasticity at the microstructural scale. We find that the overall behavior is not described by a strain gradient elasticity. In other words, strain gradient theories are not invariant under averaging at this scale. We also find that the overall behavior may be described by a kernel-based nonlocal elasticity theory, and approximated locally by a fractional strain gradient elasticity. Consequently, one can obtain various scaling laws with exponent between zero (classical elasticity) and one (strain-gradient elasticity). We also learn the overall behavior using a Fourier neural operator.</p>

            <p>Cold atom experiments show that a mobile impurity particle immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate forms a well-defined quasiparticle (Bose polaron) for weak to moderate impurity-boson interaction strengths, whereas a significant line broadening is consistently observed for strong interactions. Motivated by this, we introduce a phenomenological theory based on the assumption that the most relevant states are characterized by the impurity correlated with at most one boson, since they have the largest overlap with the uncorrelated states to which the most common experimental probes couple. These experimentally relevant states can however decay to lower energy states characterised by correlations involving multiple bosons, and we model this using a minimal variational wave function combined with a complex impurity-boson interaction strength. We first motivate this approach by comparing to a more elaborate theory that includes correlations with up to two bosons. Our phenomenological model is shown to recover the main results of two recent experiments probing both the spectral and the non-equilibrium properties of the Bose polaron. Our work offers an intuitive framework for analyzing experimental data and highlights the importance of understanding the complicated problem of the Bose polaron decay in a many-body setting.</p>

            <p>Recent years have seen a vast increase in research onto van der Waals magnetic materials, due to the richness of many-body effects and the versatility for next-generation technologies. In many of these systems, magnetism is introduced via light 3\textit{d}-transition metal elements, combined with chalcogenides or halogens. Despite the high technological promise in the field of spintronics, the connection between the \textit{d}-wave orbital configuration and the occurrence of low-dimensional magnetic order is currently unclear. To solve this issue, here we address the prototypical two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI\textsubscript{3}, via complementary absorption and photoemission spectroscopies, and density functional theory calculations. We reveal the electronic structure and orbital character of bulk CrI\textsubscript{3} in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, describing the couplings underpinning its energy diagram, and demonstrating that the mechanism of stabilization of ferromagnetism in this material is attributable to the orbital mixing between I \textit{p} and Cr \textit{e\textsubscript{g}} states. These findings reveal the microscopic connection between orbital and spin degrees of freedom, providing fundamental insights that can be readily generalized to many other low-dimensional magnetic materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gunnar F. Schwertfeger, Po-Hao Chang, Predrag Nikolic, Igor I. Mazin</p>
            <p>The Kagome lattice is a 2D network of corner sharing triangles found in several rare earth materials resulting in a complicated and often frustrated magnetic system. In the last decades, modifications of the motif, such as breathing Kagome, asymmetric Kagome, and twisted Kagome were brought into the limelight. In particular, the latter has lower symmetry than the original Kagome and thus allows implementations of an "Ising-local" Hamiltonian, leading to a 2D spin ice. One such material implementation, HoAgGe, was recently reported to have an exceptionally rich phase diagram and is a strongly frustrated 2D spin-ice material with a twisted-Kagome geometry. In the presence of an external magnetic field the compound exhibits step-like magnetization plateaus at simple fractions of the saturation magnetization. It is believed that this phenomenon results from strong single-site anisotropy, which in HoAgGe was found to be in-plane and along a high-symmetry direction. Previous Monte Carlo simulations with empirical exchange parameters explain some, but not all experimental observations. In this work we present (a) first-principle calculations of the crucial model parameters and (b) direct energy minimization via a Reduced-Configuration-Space search, as well as Monte-Carlo simulations of the field-dependent phase diagram. We find that for HoAgGe the calculated exchange parameters are very different from the earlier suggested empirical ones, and describe the phase diagram much more accurately. This is likely because the first-principles parameters are, in addition to geometrically, also parametrically frustrated.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. I. Dykman, J. Pollanen</p>
            <p>Electrons trapped above the surface of helium provide a means to study many-body physics free from the randomness that comes from defects in other condensed-matter systems. Localizing an electron in an electrostatic quantum dot makes its energy spectrum discrete, with controlled level spacing. The lowest two states can act as charge qubit states. In this paper, we study how the coupling to the quantum field of capillary waves on helium -- ripplons -- affects electron dynamics. As we show, the coupling can be strong. This bounds the parameter range where electron-based charge qubits can be implemented. The constraint is different from the conventional relaxation time constraint. The electron-ripplon system in a dot is similar to a color center formed by an electron defect coupled to phonons in a solid. In contrast to solids, the coupling in the electron on helium system can be varied from strong to weak. This enables a qualitatively new approach to studying color center physics. We analyze the spectroscopy of the pertinent synthetic color centers in a broad range of the coupling strength</p>

            <p>We compute the complete set of second order transport coefficients of the unitary Fermi gas, a dilute gas of spin 1/2 particles interacting via an $s$-wave interaction tuned to infinite scattering length. The calculation is based on kinetic theory and the Chapman-Enskog method at second order in the Knudsen expansion. We take into account the exact two-body collision integral. We extend previous results on second order coefficients related to shear stress by including terms related to heat flow and gradients of the fugacity. We confirm that the thermal relaxation time is given by the simple estimate $\tau_\kappa = \kappa m/(c_PT)$ even if the full collision kernel is taken into account. Here, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $m$ is the mass of the particles, $c_P$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $T$ is the temperature.</p>

            <h2>Unusual electronic structure in underdoped cuprate superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Li, Minghuan Zeng, Huaiming Guo, Shiping Feng</p>
            <p>The underdoped cuprate superconductors are characterized by the opening of the pseudogap, while such an aspect of the pseudogap effect should be reflected in the low-energy electronic structure (LEES). Here the effect of the pseudogap on LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is investigated within the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. The strong coupling of the electrons with the spin excitation induces the pseudogap-state in the particle-hole channel and superconducting (SC) state in the particle-particle channel, where the pseudogap and SC gap respectively originate from the electron normal and anomalous self-energies, and are evaluated by taking into account the vertex correction. As a natural consequence of the interplay between the pseudogap-state and SC-state, the SC transition temperature Tc exhibits a dome-like shape of the doping dependence, however, in a striking contrast to Tc in the underdoped regime, the pseudogap crossover temperature T* is much higher than Tc in the underdoped regime, and then it decreases with the increase of doping, eventually disappearing together with Tc at the end of the SC dome. Concomitantly, the spectral weight on the electron Fermi surface (EFS) at around the antinodal region is suppressed strongly by this pseudogap, and then EFS is truncated to form four disconnected Fermi arcs centered around the nodal region with the largest spectral weight located at around the tips of the disconnected Fermi arcs. Moreover, the dip in the peak-dip-hump structure observed in the energy distribution curve and checkerboard charge ordering found in the ARPES autocorrelation are intrinsically connected with the emergence of the pseudogap. The theory therefore indicates that the same spin excitation that governs both the pseudogap-state and SC-state naturally leads to the exotic features of LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Metric Enhancement and Hierarchical Scaling in One-Dimensional Quasiperiodic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jundi Wang, Yuxiao Chen, Huaqing Huang</p>
            <p>The quantum metric, a key component of quantum geometry, plays a central role in a wide range of physical phenomena and has been extensively studied in periodic crystals and moiré materials. Here, we systematically investigate quantum geometry in one-dimensional (1D) quasiperiodic systems and uncover novel properties that fundamentally distinguish them from both periodic crystals and disordered media. Our comparative analysis reveals that quasiperiodicity significantly enhances the quantum metric -- despite the absence of translational symmetry -- due to the presence of critical wavefunctions with long-range spatial correlations. In the Aubry-André-Harper model, we show that the quantum metric serves as a sensitive probe of localization transitions, exhibiting sharp changes at the critical point and distinct behaviors near mobility edges. In the Fibonacci chain, characterized by a singular continuous spectrum, we discover an anomalous enhancement of the quantum metric when the Fermi level lies within the minimal gaps of the fractal energy spectrum. Using a perturbative renormalization group framework, we trace this enhancement to the hierarchical structure of the spectrum and the bonding-antibonding nature of critical states across narrow gaps. Our findings establish a fundamental connection between wavefunction criticality, spectral fractality, and quantum geometry, suggesting quasiperiodic systems as promising platforms for engineering enhanced quantum geometric properties beyond conventional crystalline paradigms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michel Caffarel</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a compact analytical approximation for the quantum partition function of systems composed of quantum oscillators. The proposed formula is general and applicable to an arbitrary number of oscillators described by a rather general class of potential energy functions (not necessarily polynomials). Starting from the exact path integral expression of the partition function, we introduce a time-dependent Gaussian approximation for the potential contribution and, then, invoke a principle of minimal sensitivity to minimize the error. This leads to a system of coupled nonlinear equations whose solution yields the optimal parameters of the gaussian approximation. The resulting approximate partition function accurately reproduces thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy, average energy, and specific heat -- even at zero temperature -- with typical errors of only a few percent. We illustrate the performance of our approximate formula with numerical results for systems of up to ten coupled anharmonic oscillators. These results are compared to "exact" numerical results obtained via Hamiltonian diagonalization for small systems and Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations for larger ones.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tero Mäkinen, Anshul D. S. Parmar, Silvia Bonfanti, Mikko Alava</p>
            <p>Predicting the failure and plasticity of solids remains a longstanding challenge, with broad implications for materials design and functional reliability. Disordered solids like metallic glasses can fail either abruptly or gradually without clear precursors, and the mechanical response depends strongly on composition, thermal history and deformation protocol -- impeding generalizable modeling. While deep learning methods offer predictive power, they often rely on numerous input parameters, hindering interpretability, methodology advancement and practical deployment. Here, we propose a macroscopic, physically grounded approach that uses plastic strain accumulation in the elastic regime to robustly predict deformation and yield. This method reduces complexity and improves interpretability, offering a practical alternative for disordered materials. For the Cu-Zr-(Al) metallic glasses prepared with varied annealing, we identify two limiting regimes of plastic strain growth: power-law in poorly annealed and exponential in well-annealed samples. A physics-informed framework with Bayesian inference extracts growth parameters from stress-strain data within $\sim$5\% strain, enabling early prediction of bulk response and yield point, well before the failure. The predictive performance improves with annealing, and bulk plasticity correlates with the microscopic plastic activity from scattered to growth near yielding. This work presents a physically interpretable and experimentally relevant framework for predicting plasticity and failure in metallic glasses from early mechanical response, offering both theoretical insights and practical tools for material characterization and design.</p>

Applying this framework to a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we reveal spin-split magnon bands that support both intrinsic and extrinsic spin Nernst and Seebeck currents. For realistic parameters, we predict a sizable magnon spin-splitting angle (about 3.3 degrees) and a pure transverse spin current capable of exerting a strong spin-splitter torque suitable for magnetization switching.</p>

Gate-dependent spectroscopic measurements reveal two distinct regimes: under-doped ({\nu} = -2.3) and optimally doped ({\nu} = -2.6). In the under-doped regime, partial superconductivity arises, forming a network interspersed with non-gapped regions. At optimal doping, the entire unit cell demonstrates superconductivity, with gap size modulation showing an anti-correlation with the local density of states.

Solving the Dirac equation in this background produces spheroidal wavefunctions forming a highly degenerate manifold of normalizable zero modes, with degeneracy proportional to the total absolute flux.

Projecting interactions into this band yields Laughlin-type correlated states. The entanglement spectrum shows a chiral tower consistent with a virtual edge, demonstrating bulk-edge correspondence in a closed geometry. This generalizes the zero-flux flat-band construction of \cite{Parhizkar:2024som} to curved backgrounds, with potential applications to synthetic and astrophysical systems.</p>

            <p>Entanglement underpins quantum information processing and computing, yet its experimental quantification in complex, many-body condensed matter systems remains a considerable challenge. Here, we reveal a highly entangled electronic phase proximate to a quantum metal-insulator transition, identified by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering interferometry. This approach reveals that entanglement across atomic sites generates characteristic interference patterns, which our model accurately reproduces, enabling extraction of a full entanglement spectrum and resolution of the underlying quantum states. Our analysis of the pyrochlore iridate Nd2Ir2O7 demonstrates that the system undergoes pronounced quantum fluctuations in its spin, orbital and charge degrees of freedom, even in the presence of a long-range 'all-in-all-out' antiferromagnetic order. Importantly, the observed entanglement signatures facilitate the coexistence of multiple exotic symmetry-breaking orders. Complementary investigations using Raman spectroscopy corroborate the presence of these hidden orders and their emergent excitations. In particular, we observe a two-magnon-bound state below the lowest single-magnon excitation energy, which, together with split phonon modes, provides strong evidence for cubic symmetry-breaking orders of magnetic origin juxtaposed with the all-in-all-out order. Our work thus establishes a direct link between quantum entanglement and emergent unconventional orders, opening new avenues for investigating quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Electride-like $s$ States Coexisting with Correlated $d$ Electrons in NdNiO$_2$</h2>

            <p>Despite exhibiting a similar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band character to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates host additional electron pockets that distinguish them from single-band cuprates. The elusive orbital origin of these electron pockets has led to competing theoretical scenarios. Here, using polarization-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we determine the orbital character of the Fermi surfaces in NdNiO$_2$. Our data reveal that the electron-like pocket arises predominantly from interstitial $s$ states, with negligible contributions from rare-earth 5$d$ and 4$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level. The observation of well-defined quantum well states indicates a uniform distribution of these interstitial electrons throughout the film thickness. By comparing with electronic structure of LaNiO$_2$, we find that the rare-earth element modulates the Ni-derived bands and hopping integrals through a chemical pressure effect. These findings clarify the role of rare-earth elements in shaping the low-energy electronic structure and establish the presence of electride-like interstitial $s$ states in a correlated oxide system, where electrons occupy lattice voids rather than atomic orbitals. The electride-like character offer new insight into the self-doping and superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.</p>

            <h2>Generation of new quadratic coefficients within Ginzburg-Landau theory: Applications for specific heat calculations in various high-temperature superconductors</h2>

            <p>We revisit Landau's theory by renormalizing quadratic coefficients from nonlinear polynomial equations to adapt them to the system's dimensionality. These coefficients are employed to perform detailed specific-heat calculations for several high-temperature superconductors near the superconducting transition. We phenomenologically explain the change in the specific heat jump using Ginzburg-Landau theory, which is applicable to any spatial arrangement and interactions between electrons that influence the system's symmetries. We discuss the effects that may lead to the rapid and non-monotonic variation of the specific heat jump, $\Delta{C_p}/T_{c}$, across the transition over relatively small ranges of fluctuations, focusing particularly on changes attributed to the Sommerfeld coefficient in the normal state. We quantitatively explain the considerable reduction, disappearance, or significant enhancement of the specific heat anomaly at the superconducting transition, considering strong fluctuation corrections to the Ginzburg-Landau theory of low-dimensional systems. Additionally, we study the evolution of specific heat jumps by varying the system's dimensionality and discuss the results in relation to experimental observations of specific-heat jumps in iron-, yttrium-, and bismuth-based superconductors, as well as in $\beta$-pyrochlore oxides superconductors like $KOs_2O_6$.</p>

            <h2>Acoustoelectric superlattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eli Meril, Unmesh Ghorai, Tobias Holder, Rafi Bistritzer</p>
            <p>We introduce a new class of tunable periodic structures, formed by launching two obliquely propagating surface acoustic waves on a piezoelectric substrate that supports a two-dimensional quantum material. The resulting acoustoelectric superlattice exhibits two salient features. First, its periodicity is widely tunable, spanning a length scale intermediate between moiré superlattices and optical lattices, enabling the formation of narrow, topologically nontrivial energy bands. Second, unlike moiré systems, where the superlattice amplitude is set by intrinsic interlayer tunneling and lattice relaxation, the amplitude of the acoustoelectric potential is externally tunable via the surface acoustic wave power. Using massive monolayer graphene as an example, we demonstrate that varying the frequencies and power of the surface acoustic waves enables in-situ control over the band structure of the 2D material, generating flat bands and nontrivial valley Chern numbers, featuring a highly localized Berry curvature.</p>

            <h2>CEMP: a platform unifying high-throughput online calculation, databases and predictive models for clean energy materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jifeng Wang, Jiazhe Ju, Ying Wang</p>
            <p>The development of materials science is undergoing a shift from empirical approaches to data-driven and algorithm-oriented research paradigm. The state-of-the-art platforms are confined to inorganic crystals, with limited chemical space, sparse experimental data and a lack of integrated online computation for rapid validation. Here, we introduce the Clean Energy Materials Platform (CEMP), an open-access platform that integrates high-throughput computing workflows, multi-scale machine learning (ML) models and a comprehensive materials database tailored for clean energy applications. A key feature of CEMP is the online calculation module, which enables fully automatic quantum and molecular dynamics simulations via structured table uploads. CEMP harmonizes heterogeneous data from experimental measurements, theoretical calculation and AI-based predictions for four material classes, including small molecules, polymers, ionic liquids, and crystals. The platform hosts ~ 376,000 entries, including ~6,000 experimental records, ~50,000 quantum-chemical calculations and ~320,000 AI-predicted properties. The database covers 12 critical properties and the corresponding ML models demonstrate robust predictive power with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.94, thus ensures rapid material screening, structure-property relationship analysis and multi-objective optimization for clean energy applications. CEMP aims to establish a digital ecosystem for clean energy materials, enabling a closed-loop workflow from data acquisition to material discovery and real-time online validation.</p>

            <h2>Shear flow of frictional spheroids: lentil-like grains slide more than rice-like</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo Bilotto, Martin Trulsson, Jean-François Molinari</p>
            <p>The rheology of dense granular shear flows is influenced by friction and particle shape. We investigate numerically the impact of non-spherical particle geometries under shear on packing fraction, stress ratios, velocity fluctuations, force distribution, and dissipation mechanisms, for a wide range of inertial numbers, friction coefficients and aspect ratios. We obtain a regime diagram for the dissipation which shows that lentil-like (oblate) particles exhibit an extended sliding regime compared to rice-like (prolate) particles with the same degree of eccentricity. Additionally, we identify non-monotonic behaviour of slightly aspherical particles at low friction, linking it to their higher fluctuating rotational kinetic energy. We find that angular velocity fluctuations are generally reduced when particles align with the flow, except in highly frictional rolling regimes, where fluctuations collapse onto a power-law distribution and motion becomes less correlated. Moreover, for realistic friction coefficients power dissipation tends to concentrate along the major axis aligned with the flow, where slip events are more frequent. We also show that flat particles develop stronger fabric anisotropy than elongated ones, influencing macroscopic stress transmission. These findings provide new insights into the role of particle shape in granular mechanics, with implications for both industrial and geophysical applications.</p>

            <h2>Direct observation of distinct bulk and edge nonequilibrium spin accumulation in ultrathin MoTe$_2$</h2>

            <p>Low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) topological materials such as MoTe$_2$ host efficient charge-to-spin conversion (CSC) mechanisms that can be harnessed for novel electronic and spintronic devices. However, the nature of the various CSC mechanisms and their correlation with underlying crystal symmetries remain unsettled. In this work, we use local spin-sensitive electrochemical potential measurements to directly probe the spatially dependent nonequilibrium spin accumulation in MoTe$_2$ flakes down to four atomic layers. We are able to clearly disentangle contributions originating from the spin Hall and Rashba-Edelstein effects and uncover an abundance of unconventional spin polarizations that develop uniquely in the sample bulk and edges with decreasing thickness. Using ab-initio calculations, we construct a unified understanding of all the observed CSC components in relation to the material dimensionality and stacking arrangement. Our findings not only illuminate previous CSC results on MoTe$_2$ but also have important ramifications for future devices that can exploit the local and layer-dependent spin properties of this 2D topological material.</p>

            <h2>Coexistent multifractal mesoscopic fluctuations in Integer Quantum Hall Transition and in Orbital Hall Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan L. Pessoa, Antônio M. S. Macêdo, Anderson L. R. Barbosa</p>
            <p>We show that the integer quantum Hall transition in a disordered nanowire with orbital momentum-space texture connected to four terminals is accompanied by an orbital Hall transition. We applied a multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and found that both conductance fluctuations in the integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) and orbital-conductance fluctuations in the orbital Hall transition (OHT) display multifractal behavior. We argue that this multifractality is primarily related to disorder, which gives rise to the strong fluctuations that are fingerprints of IQHT and OHT, but is also a consequence of the fact that the nanowire has finite size, which causes a weakening of the multifractality in a certain range of values of disorder strength followed by a new regime of increasing multifractality with increasing disorder strength. Furthermore, our findings indicate that OHT can bring novel insights to future IQHT analysis.</p>

            <p>In this work, we have explored the Metallic-Flux Nanonucleation method to synthesize single crystals and nanowires (diameter $\approx$ 170 nm) of CeIn$_{3}$ and compare their properties. The effects of reduced dimensionality were systematically investigated using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Selected area electron diffraction (SAED), magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Semi-quantitative EDS analysis revealed a Ce:In ratio of 1:3.1(1), and the SAED results confirmed that the nanowires are polycrystalline with a cubic unit cell. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and NMR data indicated a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition to $T_N$ $\approx$ 2.4 K compared to the bulk value ($\approx$ 10 K). Furthermore, NMR analysis at temperatures below 2.8 K showed a reduced quadrupole frequency, $\nu_Q$ $\approx$ 1.77(2) MHz, and provided evidence of polycrystalline nanowires formed within the nanoporous alumina template, in agreement with SAED results. We attribute these findings to an increasing magnetic order frustration induced by dimensionality in CeIn$_{3}$ nanowires.</p>

            <h2>Floquet-Engineering Weyl Points and Linked Fermi Arcs from Straight Nodal Lines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongling Liu, Zheng-Yang Zhuan, Zhongbo Yan</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.</p>

            <p>Exciton transport is fundamental for understanding transport phenomena in bosonic systems and for embracing excitation energy transfer in materials. Spatially indirect excitons (IXs) are composed of electrons and holes in separated layers. Long IX lifetimes allow them to form quantum bosonic states and travel long distances. In this work, we measured IX transport in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure by time-resolved photoluminescence imaging. These measurements probe the kinetics of IX cloud expansion and reveal the transport characteristics. We found IX transport with anomalously high diffusivity, orders of magnitude higher than for regular diffusive exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures. This efficient IX transport agrees with long-range ballistic transport and is consistent with the Bose-Hubbard theory prediction of superfluid in moire superlattices.</p>

            <h2>Universal shape-dependence of quantum entanglement in disordered magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Natalie Love, István A. Kovács</p>
            <p>Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Deciphering the interplay between wetting and chemo-mechanical fracture in lithium-ion battery cathode materials</h2>

            <p>Crack growth in lithium-ion battery electrodes is typically detrimental and undesirable. However, recent experiments suggest that stabilized fracture of cathode active materials in liquid electrolytes can increase electrochemically active surfaces, shorten diffusion pathway, enhance (de)lithiation and improve overall capacity. To decipher the fundamental couplings between electrolyte wetting and fracture evolution and evaluate their influences on macroscopic battery performance, we conducted an integrated experiment-simulation study on $\alpha$-V2O5 single crystals and polycrystalline NCM as model cathode materials. Despite synthesis challenges, single-crystal $\alpha$-V2O5 offers clearer fundamental insights than polycrystalline counterparts with grain-boundary complexities. Fracture patterns and lithiation heterogeneities on the samples were mapped using advanced scanning techniques after chemical (de)lithiation cycles, exhibiting excellent agreements with simulations by the developed multiphysics model. Results reveal a mutually reinforcing interplay between wetting and fracture: (i) electrolyte infiltration at fracture surfaces enhances (de)lithiation and compositional heterogeneity; (ii) wetting influences fracture dynamics, including fracture modes, propagation distance and directionality. The validated modelling framework is further applied to simulations on polycrystalline NCM particles under constant-current (dis)charging, highlighting the critical role of wetting in promoting fracture and improving overall capacity. This work bridges fundamental understanding of wetting-fracture coupling with practical implications for battery performance optimization via controlled fracture engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Su, Brian J. Blankenau, Namhoon Kim, Jessica A. Krogstad, Elif Ertekin</p>
            <p>Nitrogen (N) is a key alloying element that enhances the performance of Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels, improving austenite stability, corrosion resistance, and yield strength. However, the role of N in modifying chemical ordering, particularly short-range order (SRO) and long-range order (LRO), is complex due to the multi-sublattice nature and magnetic interactions in these alloys. In this work, we combine first-principles calculations with the spin cluster expansion (spin CE) method to systematically investigate the effects of N on chemical ordering in Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Our atomistic models confirm a strong affinity between N and Cr, which drives the formation of N-Cr SRO and, at higher N concentrations, stabilizes M4N-type ordered phases (M = metal). Monte Carlo simulations reveal that low N concentrations promote local N-Cr or N-N SRO, while increasing N content leads to the emergence of Cr-and N-rich LRO structures. We also show that the presence of N suppresses intrinsic Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr SRO by competing with these interactions, particularly at high concentrations. The impact of Cr content on ordering diminishes as N approaches its solubility limit. These findings are consistent with experimental observations in high-N austenitic steels. Finally, we discuss the influence of kinetic and magnetic effects on SRO evolution in high-N alloys. This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding N-driven chemical ordering and offers insights into microstructural changes during nitriding processes.</p>

            <h2>Scaling laws for doublet craters formed by low-velocity impacts of unequal-mass spheres into a granular bed</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruto Kitagawa, Ririha Obara, Yu Matsuda</p>
            <p>Understanding the formation mechanism of doublet craters is an important challenge for advancing knowledge in astronomy and granular physics. In this study, we investigated craters formed by low-velocity impacts of two steel spheres with different masses into a granular bed. Even when the masses were different, a figure-eight-shaped doublet crater and a central ridge were observed, similar to the case with equal masses. However, the resulting shape became asymmetric even without a time delay between impacts. The total length of the doublet crater increased depending on the spacing between the two spheres and the ratio of their impact energies. These results followed a theoretical model based on a scaling law, where the crater diameter is proportional to the one-fourth power of the impact energy. A model was also developed to describe the crater overlap, which increases as the spheres become closer. It was also shown that the crater diameters vary with the time difference, and that the second impact tends to form a larger crater due to fluidization induced by the first.</p>

            <p>Building upon previously introduced Bistable Vortex Memory (BVM) as a novel, nonvolatile, high-density, and scalable superconductor memory technology, this work presents a methodology that uses BVM arrays to address challenges in data-driven algorithms and neural networks, specifically focusing on matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). The BVM approach introduces a novel superconductor-based methodology for in-memory arithmetic, achieving ultra-high-speed and energy-efficient computation by utilizing BVM arrays for in-memory computation. The design employs a tiled multiplier structure where BVM's inherent current summation capability is combined with Quantizer Buffer (QB) cells to convert the analog accumulated current into a variable number of digital Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) pulses. These pulses are then processed by T1 adder cells, which handle binary addition and carry propagation, thereby forming a complete functional multiplier unit. This paper thus presents an efficient MVM architecture that uses these BVM-based multipliers in a systolic array configuration to enable parallel computation. A key innovation is an optimized BVM array structure specifically tailored for multiplication applications, involving a restructuring of Sense Lines (SLs) with diagonal connections to reduce area and an adjusted input scheme to enhance computational efficiency compared to the general-purpose BVM array design. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with a 4-bit multiplier operating at 20 GHz with 50 ps latency and an MVM structure demonstrating operation at 20 GHz. Furthermore, we showcase how this multiplier design can be extended to support Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. This work paves the way for power-efficient neural networks by enabling high-speed in-memory computation.</p>

            <p>Understanding oxygen diffusion along grain boundaries (GBs) is critical for controlling ionic conductivity in oxide ceramics. GBs are typically thought to enhance ionic transport due to structural disorder and increased free volume. In this study, we report an unexpected anomaly: the $\Sigma 3(111)$ GB in thorium dioxide (ThO$_2$), despite its compact and coherent structure, exhibits significantly higher oxygen ionic conductivity compared to the more open GB ($\Sigma 19$ as an example). Using atomistic simulations based on a machine learning interatomic potential, we revealed that the high conductivity in the $\Sigma 3$ GB arises from a collective diffusion mechanism involving highly correlated atomic motion reminiscent of a superionic state. In contrast, the $\Sigma 19$ GB follows conventional pipe diffusion, consistent with its more open structure. This comparison highlights that enhanced GB conductivity is not simply correlated with free volume, but can occur from specific structural motifs that enable collective transport. These findings provide new guidance for designing GB-engineered oxides with targeted ionic transport properties for energy applications.</p>

By examining a simple model that exhibits prethermalization, we demonstrate that this effect indeed manifests under periodic driving. We further discuss the realization of this phenomenon in a variety of systems within a unified theoretical framework.</p>

Here, we compare two members of this family, LuOs$_3$B$_2$ and YCo$_3$B$_2$, with similar crystallography but differing chemical composition, leading to distinct electronic correlation strengths and spin-orbit coupling effects. We confirm superconductivity in LuOs$_3$B$_2$ with $T_c = 4.75$K, while YCo$_3$B$_2$ remains non-superconducting above 1.8K. First-principles estimates of the electron-phonon coupling for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ are consistent with its observed $T_c$ and suggest a moderate coupling strength. Both materials exhibit kagome-derived electronic features, including quasi-flat bands, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities. Fermi surface calculations reveal quasi-one-dimensional behavior along the $c$-axis in YCo$_3$B$_2$, in contrast to the more three-dimensional Fermiology of LuOs$_3$B$_2$. Phonon calculations for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ show imaginary modes, indicating potential lattice instabilities. Experimental estimates of the Wilson and Kadowaki-Woods ratios point to non-negligible electronic correlations in both compounds.</p>

            <p>Quantized conductance in quasi-one-dimensional systems not only provides a hallmark of ballistic transport, but also serves as a gateway for exploring quantum phenomena. Recently, a unique hidden Rashba effect attracts tremendous attention, which arises from the compensation of opposite spin polarizations of a Rashba bilayer in inversion symmetric crystals with dipole fields, such as bismuth oxyselenide ($\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$). However, investigating this effect utilizing conductance quantization is still challenging. Here we report the conductance quantization observed in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown high-mobility $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$ nanoribbon, where quantized conductance plateaus up to $44\cdot 2e^{2}/{h}$ ($e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is the Planck constant, and the factor $2$ results from spin degeneracy) are achieved at zero magnetic field. Due to the hidden Rashba effect, the quantized conductance remains in multiples of $2e^{2}/{h}$ without Zeeman splitting even under magnetic field up to $12$ T. Moreover, within a specific range of magnetic field, the plateau sequence exhibits the Pascal triangle series, namely $(1,3,6,10,15\dots )\cdot 2e^{2}/{h}$, reflecting the interplay of size quantization in two transverse directions. These observations are well captured by an effective hidden Rashba bilayer model. Our results demonstrate $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$ as a compelling platform for spintronics and the investigation of emergent phenomena.</p>

The study revealed that in flat samples, the nucleation rate is primarily influenced by the activity of the mold wall surface, which is affected by melt overheating and subcooling, while in bulk samples, supercooling and nucleation are additionally influenced by factors such as impurity activity, temperature, and density fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>DFT-Guided Operando Raman Characterization of Ni-Based Phases Relevant to Electrochemical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harol Moreno Fernández, Siavash Karbasizadeh, Esmaeil Adabifiroozjaei, Leopoldo Molina-Luna, Jan P. Hofmann, Mohammad Amirabbasi</p>
            <p>We present a phase-resolved investigation of Ni-based oxides and hydroxides relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), combining ground-state DFT+U calculations with operando and in situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by high-resolution TEM. Five crystalline phases-cubic and hexagonal NiO, monoclinic and trigonal Ni(OH)2, and NiOOH-are systematically characterized in terms of their vibrational and electronic structure. Although the DFT models are idealized (0 K, defect-free, no solvation), they serve as clean, phase-specific references for interpreting complex experimental spectra. Cubic NiO is confirmed to be dynamically and electronically stable, consistent with dominant Raman modes observed experimentally. Despite dynamic instabilities in phonon dispersions, hexagonal NiO is structurally verified via TEM, suggesting substrate- or defect-stabilized metastability. Ni(OH)2 polymorphs are both vibrationally stable semiconductors, with the trigonal phase exhibiting stronger spin polarization. NiOOH exhibits spin-polarized electronic states across the Brillouin zone, consistent with its asymmetric band structure under ferromagnetic ordering. Independently, phonon calculations reveal soft modes near the Gamma-point, indicating dynamic instability under idealized conditions, yet operando Raman spectra align closely with calculated zone-center modes. However, introducing 0.03 Angstrom symmetry-breaking displacements relaxes the NiOOH lattice off its saddle point, removing imaginary phonon modes and stabilizing the phase. This integrated framework demonstrates how idealized DFT can reveal intrinsic fingerprints that anchor the interpretation of vibrational and electronic responses in catalytically active, dynamically evolving Ni-based materials.</p>

            <h2>The Ferroelectric Superconducting Field Effect Transistor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Paghi, Laura Borgongino, Elia Strambini, Giorgio De Simoni, Lucia Sorba, Francesco Giazotto</p>
            <p>The ferroelectric field-effect transistor (Fe-FET) is a three-terminal semiconducting device first introduced in the 1950s. Despite its potential, a significant boost in Fe-FET research occurred about ten years ago with the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide. This material has been incorporated into electronic processes since the mid-2000s. Here, we observed ferroelectricity in a superconducting Josephson FET (Fe-JoFET) operating at cryogenic temperatures below 1 Kelvin. The Fe-JoFET was fabricated on the InAsOI platform, which features an InAs epilayer hosted by an electrical insulating substrate, using HfO2 as the gate insulator, making it a promising candidate due to its ferroelectric properties. The Fe-JoFET exhibits significant hysteresis in the switching current and normal-state resistance transfer characteristics, which depend on the range of gate voltages. This phenomenon opens a new research area exploring the interaction between ferroelectricity and superconductivity in hybrid superconducting-semiconducting systems, with potential applications in cryogenic data storage and computation. Supporting this, the Fe-JoFET was operated as a cryogenic superconducting single memory cell, exhibiting both dissipative and non-dissipative states. Its non-volatility was tested over a 24-hour measurement period. We also demonstrated that the Fe-JoFET can retain information at temperatures above the superconductor critical temperature, resulting in a temperature-fault-tolerant memory cell resistant to temperature oscillations or, in the worst case, cryostat faults.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengxin Yang, Jiangzhen Shi, Kan-Hao Xue, Jun-Hui Yuan, Xiangshui Miao</p>
            <p>There has been a high demand in rectifying the band gap under-estimation problem in density functional theory (DFT), while keeping the computational load at the same level as local density approximation. DFT-1/2 and shell DFT-1/2 are useful attempts, as they correct the spurious electron self-interaction through the application of self-energy potentials, which pull down the valence band. Nevertheless, the self-energy potential inevitably disturbs the conduction band, and these two methods fail for semiconductors whose hole and electron are entangled in the same shell-like regions. In this work, we introduce the occupation-dependent DFT-1/2 method, where conduction band states are not subject to the additional self-energy potential disturbance. This methodology works for difficult cases such as $\text{Li}_2\text{O}_2$, $\text{Cu}_2\text{O}$ and two-dimensional semiconductors. Using a shell-like region for the self-energy potential, and allowing for downscaling of the atomic self-energy potential (with an $A$ < 1 factor), the occupation-dependent shell DFT+$A$-1/2 method yields more accurate conduction band and valence band edge levels for monolayer $\text{MoS}_2$, compared with the computationally demanding hybrid functional approach.</p>

            <p>We study spin/fermion ladder models with multipole phases, which are traditional transverse-field-Ising phases formed by multipole moments. These phases feature non-trivial order with zero magnetization. The multipole models have dimer local conserved quantities that are Ising terms of spin. The Hilbert spaces are locally fragmented into independent sectors described effectively by {\it higher-order spin}. For dipole models, we consider two ladder geometries and work out the phase diagrams. Different phases of the model can be distinguished experimentally with the dynamical structure factor. Higher-order multipole models are obtained by introducing more dimer conserved quantities. The phases are characterized by the values of the local conserved quantities and the transverse-Ising phases of the higher-order spin.</p>

            <h2>Ferroelectrically Controlled Chirality Switching of Weyl Quasiparticles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeling Li, Yu liu, Le Du, Fengyu Li, Zhifeng Liu, Lei Li, Lei Wang, Botao Fu, Xiao-Ping Li</p>
            <p>Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface phonon arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.</p>

            <p>Ceramics are typically brittle at ambient conditions due to their covalent or ionic bonding and limited dislocation activities. While plasticity, and occasionally superplasticity, can be achieved in ceramics at high temperatures through thermally activated phenomena, creep, and grain boundary sliding, their deformation at ambient temperature and pressure remains challenging. Processing under high pressure via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) method offers new pathways for severe plastic deformation (SPD) of ceramics. This article reviews recent advances in HPT processing of ceramics, focusing primarily on traditional ceramics (e.g., oxides, carbides, nitrides, oxynitrides) and to a lesser extent advanced ceramics (e.g., silicon, carbon, perovskites, clathrates). Key structural and microstructural features of SPD-processed ceramics are discussed, including phase transformations and the generation of nanograins and defects such as vacancies and dislocations. The properties and applications of these deformed ceramics are summarized, including powder consolidation, photoluminescence, bandgap narrowing, photovoltaics, photocatalysis (dye degradation, plastic waste degradation, antibiotic degradation, hydrogen production, CO2 conversion), electrocatalysis, thermoelectric performance, dielectric performance, and ion conductivity for Li-ion batteries. Additionally, the article highlights the role of HPT in synthesizing novel materials, such as high-entropy ceramics (particularly high-entropy oxides), black oxides, and high-pressure polymorphs, which hold promise for energy and environmental applications.</p>

In this work, we study the effects of moiré superlattices on the Landau levels of topological surface states.

As a result, the originally field-independent zeroth Landau level of moiré surface states could be tilted by the out-of-plane magnetic field.</p>

In contrast, the different MLD response of spin-orbitsplit valence bands reveals non-equilibrium, transverse spin dynamics.

            <h2>Universal Diagnostic Criterion for Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ran Wang, Ning Hao</p>
            <p>The intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) is distinguished from the Josephson diode effect (JDE) by its manifestation of nonreciprocal critical current phenomena within a monolithic superconductor, typically linked to finite-momentum Cooper pairing. The long-standing assumption that SDE requires co-breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries proves to be necessary but not sufficient. In this work, we propose a universal diagnostic criterion. Embodied in two concise inequalities, this criterion enables convenient and intuitive assessment of whether an intrinsic SDE can emerge in a given system without requiring extensive numerical calculations. Furthermore, our universal criterion provides explicit design guidelines for material systems exhibiting intrinsic SDE.</p>

            <p>Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded pi-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials which are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charith L. Hirimuthugodage, Laalitha S.I. Liyanage</p>
            <p>This study investigates the torsional mechanical properties of pristine iron (Fe) and carbon-doped iron (FeC) nanowires with [001] orientation through molecular dynamics simulations utilizing the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential developed by Liyanage et al. for accurately modeling Fe-C interactions in body-centered cubic structures. Systematic analysis across carbon concentrations (0 - 10%), temperatures (1 - 900 K), and cross-sectional dimensions 10a, 13a, 15a, ( where a = 2.81 Angstrom represents the lattice constant ) within the LAMMPS environment reveals that increasing carbon content weakens grain boundaries, reducing the maximum shear stress required to reach the critical torsional angle, while higher temperatures promote phase transitions from elastic to plastic deformation due to enhanced atomic vibrations, and larger cross-sections exhibit higher shear stress resistance attributed to strengthening effects from the outer atomic layers. By elucidating these interrelationships between carbon content, temperature, and dimensional factors, this work provides fundamental insights into the mechanical behavior of FeC nanowires under torsional loading conditions, offering valuable guidance for their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems, nanorobotic actuators, and advanced structural materials where precise control of mechanical properties is essential.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials showing room-temperature magnetism and high coercivity are desired for combining magnetism with semiconducting properties useful for spintronics. In this work, the magnetic properties of the 1T phase of MoS$_2$ have been studied at room temperature. We observe ferromagnetism with a coercivity of ~0.3 T and a maximum saturation magnetization of 0.26 emu/g at room temperature. This is the highest among coercivities reported so far in 2D magnets at room temperature. MoS$_2$ nanosheets are prepared using a single-step hydrothermal synthesis with a relative 1T-phase reaching up to 77%. We report a correlation between the structural and magnetic characteristics via interplanar distance and coercivity. The increase in interplanar distance is also accompanied by an increase in the 1T phase. Our results pave a useful way of controlling the coercivity and saturation magnetization in a 2D magnet with applications in spintronics and low-power quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The optical and magneto-optical properties of thin epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films, with thicknesses ranging from 8 to 160 nm, were investigated across the spectral range of 0.7-6.4 eV. The films were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering on MgO substrate with stress-mediating Cr buffer layer. Structural and magnetic characterization revealed an stress-induced martensitic transformation for the films thicker than 80 nm, while thinner films remained in austenite structure deformed by substrate constraint. Both X-type and Y-type twin domains were observed in martensitic samples. Magneto-optical polar Kerr effect spectra showed notable evolution with film thicknesses, demonstrating changes in electronic structure of Ni-Mn-Ga. A combination of spectroscopic ellipsometry and magneto-optical Kerr spectroscopy allowed for the deduction of the spectral dependence of full permittivity tensor of investigated samples. Three magneto-optical transitions were fitted to the spectra of non-diagonal permittivity using semiclassical theory, showing strong correlations with in-plane coercivity. Observed correlations highlight the impact of substrate-induced strain on Ni-Mn-Ga films and provide insights into the electronic structure changes associated with the martensitic transformation.</p>

            <p>Dielectric spectra are typically obtained in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by analyzing the fluctuations, in the absence of an applied electric field, of the total dipole moment of the simulation box. We compare this standard method with a protocol that focuses on a virtual cavity whose size is chosen to include short-range dipolar cross-correlations, while excluding long-range correlations that are affected by the choice of electrostatic boundary conditions. We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods. We propose that, for a liquid with a sufficiently high dielectric permittivity, the cavity protocol yields a self-spectrum consistent with the electrostatic boundary conditions applicable to the experimental situation.</p>

            <p>Solitons are striking manifestations of nonlinearity, encountered in diverse physical systems such as water waves, nonlinear optics, and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). In BECs, dark solitons emerge as exact stationary solutions of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. While they can be long-lived in elongated traps, their stability is compromised in higher dimensions due to the snake instability, which leads to the decay of the soliton into vortex structures among other excitations. We investigate the dynamics of a dark soliton in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an anisotropic harmonic trap. Using a variational ansatz that incorporates both the transverse bending of the soliton plane and the emergence of vortices along the nodal line, we derive equations of motion governing the soliton's evolution. This approach allows us to identify stable oscillation modes as well as the growth rates of the unstable perturbations. In particular, we determine the critical trap anisotropy required to suppress the snake instability. Our analytical predictions are in good agreement with full numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cecile Monthus</p>
            <p>For diffusion process involving the force $F(x)$ and the diffusion coefficient $D(x)$, the continuity equation $\partial_t P_t(x)=- \partial_xJ_t(x)$ gives the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ in terms of the current $J_t( x)=F(x)P_t(x)-D(x)\partial_x P_t(x)={\cal J}P_t( x)$ obtained from $P_t( x) $ via the application of the first-order differential current-operator ${\cal J}$. So the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ is governed by the factorized Fokker-Planck generator ${\cal F}=-\partial_x{\cal J}$, while the dynamics of the current $J_t( x)$ is governed by its supersymmetric partner ${\hat {\cal F} }= - {\cal J}\partial_x$, so that their right and left eigenvectors are directly related using the two intertwining relations ${\cal J}{\cal F}=-{\cal J}\partial_x{\cal J}={\hat {\cal F}}{\cal J}$ and ${\cal F}\partial_x=-\partial_x{\cal J}\partial_x=\partial_x{\hat {\cal F} }$. We also describe the link with the factorization of the adjoint $ {\cal F}^{\dagger}=\frac{d}{dm(x)}\frac{d}{ds(x)} $ in terms of the scale function $s(x)$ and speed measure $m(x)$. We then analyze how the supersymmetric partner ${\hat {\cal F} } = - {\cal J} \partial_x$ can be re-interpreted in two ways: (1) as the adjoint ${\mathring {\cal F}}^{\dagger} ={\mathring {\cal J} }^{\dagger} \partial_x$ of the Fokker-Planck generator ${\mathring {\cal F}}=- \partial_x{\mathring {\cal J} }$ associated to the dual force ${\mathring F}(x)=-F(x)-D'(x)$, that unifies various known Markov dualities; (2) as the non-conserved Fokker-Planck generator ${\tilde {\cal F}}_{nc} = -\partial_x{\tilde {\cal J}}-{\tilde K }(x)$ involving the force ${\tilde F}(x)=F(x) +D'(x)$ and the killing rate ${\tilde K }(x)=-F'(x)-D''(x)$, with application to shape-invariance-solvability. Finally, we describe how all these ideas can be also applied to Markov jump processes with nearest-neighbors transition rates $w(x \pm 1,x)$.</p>

Digital alloying is an approach towards growing ternary quantum wells that enables asymmetric interfaces and compositional grading in the quantum well, which can potentially modify the spin-orbit coupling in the quantum well. The spin-orbit coupling of the quantum wells is extracted from beating patterns in the low magnetic field magnetoresistance. Digital alloying is found to modify the spin-orbit coupling by up to 138 meV\textnormalÅ. The changes induced in the spin-orbit coupling can be qualitatively understood as being due to modifications in the interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</p>

However, spin-orbit coupling also enhances the sensitivity to electrical disorder, potentially increasing variability. In this work, we perform numerical simulations in a realistic device geometry to quantify the variability of the charge and spin properties of Ge qubits induced by charge traps at the SiGe/oxide interfaces. We show that while the variability of charge properties remains moderate, spin properties (g-factors and Rabi frequencies) show significant dispersion. We explore the implications of this variability for large-scale architectures, and provide guidelines to minimize variability both in terms of interface quality requirements and optimal operation strategies.</p>

Measurement results are simulated and fitted with high accuracy. Complete reversion of the ponderomotive momentum transfer allows for retrieval of the undisturbed initial state and the transient band structure for overlapping pump and probe pulses.</p>

Additionally, Ru-1 also functions as an efficient sensor for \ce{F^-}, \ce{AcO^-}, and \ce{H2PO4^-} ions, along with \ce{CN^-}, when acetonitrile is used as the solvent system. The binding constant ($K_b$) and detection limit (LoD) for \ce{CN^-} were determined to be $3.05 \times 10^6$~M$^{-1}$ and 12.8~nM, respectively, in water. The close proximity of the N--H site to the Ru(II) center, along with its notable acidity, were identified as the primary factors responsible for the high selectivity of Ru-1 toward \ce{CN^-} in aqueous media. Job's plots and density functional theory (DFT) analyses were conducted to support the anion binding mechanism. Furthermore, time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) spectroscopy was employed to evaluate the \ce{CN^-}-induced emission lifetime change of Ru-1 in water. To explore practical applicability, the Ru-1 probe was developed into paper-based strips capable of detecting \ce{CN^-} ions in the millimolar range via the naked eye under 365~nm UV illumination. It was also effectively applied for the detection of \ce{CN^-} in human breast cancer MCF-7 cell lines and natural food sources, such as apple seeds and sprouting potatoes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudo Yi, Seong-Gyu Yang, K.-I. Goh, D.-S. Lee</p>
            <p>Diffusion over networks has recently been used to define spatiotemporal scales and extend Kadanoff block spins of Euclidean space to supernodes of networks in the Laplacian renormalization group (LRG). Yet, its ad hoc coarse-graining procedure remains underdeveloped and unvalidated, limiting its broader applicability. Here we rigorously formulate an LRG preserving the equilibrium state, offering a principled coarse-graining procedure. We construct the renormalized Laplacian matrix preserving dominant spectral properties using a proper, quasi-complete basis transformation and the renormalized adjacency matrix preserving mean connectivity from equilibrium-state flows among supernodes. Applying recursively this equilibrium-preserving LRG to various hypergraphs, we find that in hypertrees with low spectral dimensions vertex degree and hyperedge cardinality distributions flow toward Poissonian forms, while in hypergraphs lacking a finite spectral dimension they broaden toward power-law forms when starting from Poissonian ones, revealing how informational, structural, and dynamical scale-invariances are interrelated.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian C. Hübl, Carl P. Goodrich</p>
            <p>Controlling the size and shape of assembled structures is a fundamental challenge in self-assembly, and is highly relevant in material design and biology. Here, we show that specific, but promiscuous, short-range binding interactions make it possible to economically assemble linear filaments of user-defined length. Our approach leads to independent control over the mean and width of the filament size distribution and allows us to smoothly explore design trade-offs between assembly quality (spread in size) and cost (number of particle species). We employ a simple hierarchical assembly protocol to minimize assembly times, and show that multiple stages of hierarchy make it possible to extend our approach to the assembly of higher-dimensional structures. Our work provides a simple and experimentally straightforward solution to size control that is immediately applicable to a broad range of systems, from DNA origami assemblies to supramolecular polymers and beyond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Píro, Jaroslav Hamrle</p>
            <p>A comprehensive Hartree-Fock analysis of the ground-state electronic structure of spherical gold nanoparticles modeled within the jellium approximation is carried out for all systems containing up to 132 delocalized electrons. Emphasis is placed on resolving the energy-level ordering, properly describing the electron density tail and associated charge spill-out, and assessing the accuracy of local exchange and kinetic energy potentials. The calculations are performed on a high-resolution real-space grid to ensure numerical precision. Significant discrepancies are observed between the exchange energy given by the Hartree-Fock approximation and the local spin density approximation (LSDA) in both the inner and outer regions of the nanoparticle. To address these differences, a refined expression of the one-electron exchange energy density as an explicit function of the charge density is proposed. Similarly, the failure of the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy model near the surface of the nanoparticle is resolved by introducing an improved expression for the one-electron kinetic energy density.</p>

            <p>The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.</p>

            <p>We report a novel localization phenomenon that emerges in non-Hermitian and quasiperiodic coupled systems, which we dub ``Anderson-Skin (AS) dualism". The emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method. Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS dualism is universal.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Induced Chiral Currents in a Mesoscopic Helicoidal Quantum Well</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edilberto O. Silva</p>
            <p>We introduce a mesoscopic quantum well whose confinement and chirality emerge solely from the intrinsic torsion of a finite helicoidal metric. This purely geometric construction requires no external gates or fields: the metric itself induces both a harmonic radial potential and a torsion-driven Zeeman term that breaks the $m \leftrightarrow -m$ degeneracy. By imposing hard-wall boundary conditions at $z = \pm L/2$, we quantize the axial motion and obtain a genuinely zero-dimensional helicoidal quantum dot. An exact analytic solution reveals an energy spectrum with chiral splitting linear in both the torsion parameter $\Omega$ and the axial quantum number $n_z$. For realistic InAs nanoroll parameters ($L = 100$ nm, $\Omega = 5\times10^{6} \mathrm{m^{-1}}$), this geometric effect results in a measurable splitting of $\sim 0.5$ meV. We propose three viable experimental platforms, ultracold atoms in optical traps, femtosecond-written photonic waveguides, and strain-engineered semiconductor nanorolls, where this torsion-induced phenomenon should be accessible with current technology.</p>

            <p>Generative models show great promise for the inverse design of molecules and inorganic crystals, but remain largely ineffective within more complex structures such as amorphous materials. Here, we present a diffusion model that reliably generates amorphous structures up to 1000 times faster than conventional simulations across processing conditions, compositions, and data sources. Generated structures recovered the short- and medium-range order, sampling diversity, and macroscopic properties of silica glass, as validated by simulations and an information-theoretical strategy. Conditional generation allowed sampling large structures at low cooling rates of 10$^{-2}$ K/ps to uncover a ductile-to-brittle transition and mesoporous silica structures. Extension to metallic glassy systems accurately reproduced local structures and properties from both computational and experimental datasets, demonstrating how synthetic data can be generated from characterization results. Our methods provide a roadmap for the design and simulation of amorphous materials previously inaccessible to computational methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Payal Wadhwa, Michael Schmid, Georg Kresse</p>
            <p>The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30° and (2$\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.</p>

            <p>In this work, we identify the local structural defects that control the non-affine displacement fields in jammed disk packings subjected to athermal, quasistatic (AQS) simple shear. While complex non-affine displacement fields typically occur during simple shear, isolated effective quadrupoles are also observed and their probability increases with increasing pressure. We show that the emergence of an isolated effective quadrupole requires the breaking of an interparticle contact that is aligned with low-frequency, spatially extended vibrational modes. Since the Eshelby inhomogeneity problem gives rise to quadrupolar displacement fields in continuum materials, we reformulate and implement Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method (EIM) for jammed disk packings. Using EIM, we show that we can reconstruct the non-affine displacement fields for jammed disk packings in response to applied shear as a sum of discrete Eshelby-like defects that are caused by mismatches in the local stiffnesses of triangles formed from Delaunay triangulation of the disk centers.</p>

            <p>Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has been in the focus of contemporary condensed matter research as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism. In the face of daunting evidence for bulk magnetic order despite promising theoretical predictions, it naturally suggests the focus on thin films where Coulomb interactions are dimensionally quenched and may yield a more strongly correlated environment prone to magnetic ordering. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT), and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to investigate atomically ordered ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) grown on Ru(0001). Contrary to predictions of magnetic order, we observe a nonmagnetic charge density wave (CDW) instability that is driven by Fermi surface nesting within the flat-band surface state, and stabilized by the incommensurate moiré stacking with the substrate. We further identify a nonmagnetic and metastable 2 $\times$ 2 surface reconstruction that breaks in-plane mirror symmetry and can be reversibly toggled via STM tip manipulation. Our spin-polarized STM measurements find no sign of any magnetic instability at the RuO$_2$ surface. As much as our findings refute proposals for either bulk or surface magnetism in RuO$_2$, we establish ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) as an intriguing platform for exploring Moiré-assisted electronic surface order.</p>

            <p>Metal-support interfaces fundamentally govern the catalytic performance of heterogeneous systems through complex interactions. Here, utilizing operando transmission electron microscopy, we uncovered a type of looping metal-support interaction in NiFe-Fe3O4 catalysts during hydrogen oxidation reaction. At the NiFe-Fe3O4 interfaces, lattice oxygens react with NiFe-activated H atoms, gradually sacrificing themselves and resulting in dynamically migrating interfaces. Meanwhile, reduced iron atoms migrate to the {111} surface of Fe3O4 support and react with oxygen molecules. Consequently, the hydrogen oxidation reaction separates spatially on a single nanoparticle and is intrinsically coupled with the redox reaction of the Fe3O4 support through the dynamic migration of metal-support interfaces. Our work provides previously unidentified mechanistic insight into metal-support interactions and underscores the transformative potential of operando methodologies for studying atomic-scale dynamics.</p>

            <p>Over nearly two decades, Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) has become a standard technique for extracting dynamic correlation functions from time-lapse microscopy data, with applications spanning colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, active fluids, and biological systems. In its most common implementation, DDM analyzes image sequences acquired with a conventional microscope equipped with a digital camera, yielding time- and wavevector-resolved information analogous to that obtained in multi-angle Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.</p>

            <p>The three-dimensional frustrated spin lattice in MgCrGaO4, where Cr3+ ions occupy a pyrochlore-like network, exemplifies a quantum magnet with competing interactions, macroscopic degeneracy, and exotic low-energy excitations. Using thermodynamic, electron spin resonance (ESR), muon spin relaxation (muSR), and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) techniques, we observe no magnetic order or spin freezing down to 57 mK, despite a sizable exchange interaction (J= 58 K) between Cr3+ (S=3/2) moments and inherent site disorder. Below the characteristic exchange energy scale, all experimental probes detect the emergence of antiferromagnetic short-range spin correlations, corroborated by magnetic diffuse scattering in the wave vector dependence of low-energy magnetic excitations centered on Q = 1.5 A^-1 in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. The low-temperature specific heat follows a near-quadratic dependence without a gap, consistent with algebraic spin correlations. These results establish MgCrGaO4 as a rare three-dimensional classical spin liquid featuring a highly degenerate ground-state manifold and gapless excitations, offering a strong impetus for the experimental realization of spin liquids in higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets.</p>

            <p>We performed classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate, from an atomistic point of view, the formation of dislocations during the epitaxial growth of Ge on Si. We show that simulations at 900 and 1000 K with deposition rates of 10$^8$ monolayers per second provide a good compromise between computational cost and accuracy. In these conditions, the ratio between the Ge deposition rate and the ad-atom jump rate is analogous to that of out-of-equilibrium experiments. In addition, the main features of the grown film (intermixing, critical film thickness, dislocation typology, and surface morphology) are well described. Our simulations reveal that dislocations originate in low-density amorphous regions that form under valleys of the rough Ge film surface. Atoms are squeezed out of these regions to the surface, releasing the stress accumulated in the film and smoothing its surface. Amorphous regions grow until atoms begin to rearrange in dislocation half-loops that propagate throughout the Ge film. The threading arm ends of the dislocation half-loops move along the surface following valleys and avoiding islands. The film surface morphology affects the propagation path of the dislocation half-loops and the resulting dislocation network.</p>

            <p>We systematically investigate the stability of the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase in spin-1/2 Heisenberg and half-filled Hubbard ladders coupled by ferromagnetic Hund's interactions. Using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze key signatures of the Haldane phase: long-range string order, finite spin gap, and characteristic entanglement spectrum degeneracies. In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials.</p>

            <p>The bulk-boundary correspondence, which relates topological properties of a material in the bulk to the presence of robust modes localized on the edge, is at the core of the now mature field of topological wave physics. More recently, it was realized that in crystalline structures, certain types of defects can host localized modes, in which case the bulk-boundary correspondence has to be replaced by a bulk-defect correspondence. These defect-localized modes are expected to have robust properties owing to their topological origin. In this work, we show how to obtain topological defect modes in a lattice possessing both mirror and chiral symmetry. The defect is obtained by endowing a plaquette with a non-trivial gauge flux. We show that the bulk-defect correspondence is satisfied by introducing appropriate topological invariants. Moreover, the topological defect modes are shown to be highly robust to the introduction of symmetry-preserving disorder. The model is then realized in an acoustic system made of a network of tubes, and the presence of topological defect mode is experimentally clearly demonstrated.</p>

            <p>The behavior of charge carriers in polar materials is governed by electron-phonon interactions, which affect their mobilities via phonon scattering and may localize carriers into self-induced deformation fields, forming self-trapped polarons. We present a first-principles study of self-trapped polaron formation in paradigmatic polar semiconductors and insulators using the variational polaron equations framework and self-consistent gradient optimization. Our method incorporates long-range corrections to the electron-phonon interaction, essential for finite-size systems. We demonstrate how the variational approach enables the identification of multiple polaronic states and supports the analysis of polarons with arbitrarily large spatial extent via energy filtering. The potential energy surfaces of the resulting polarons exhibit multiple local minima, reflecting distinct, symmetry-broken polaronic configurations in systems with degenerate band edges. Our findings align with previous theoretical studies and establish a robust foundation for future ab initio studies of polarons, especially those employing variational methods.</p>

            <p>A novel approach to moment closure problem is used to derive low dimensional laws for the dynamics of the moments of the membrane potential distribution in a population of spiking neurons. Using spectral expansion of the density equation we derive the recursive and nonlinear relation between the moments, such as the mean potential, and the population firing rates. The self-consistent dynamics found relies on the dominant eigenvalues of the evolution operator, tightly related to the moments of the single-neuron inter-spike interval distribution. Contrary to previous attempts our system can be applied both in noise- and drift-dominated regime, and both for weakly and strongly coupled population. We demonstrate the applicability of the theory for the case of a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons deriving closed analytical expressions. Truncating the mode decomposition to the first few more relevant moments, results to effectively describe the population dynamics both out-of-equilibrium and in response to strongly-varying inputs.</p>

            <p>Energy-based probabilistic models learned by maximizing the likelihood of the data are limited by the intractability of the partition function. A widely used workaround is to maximize the pseudo-likelihood, which replaces the global normalization with tractable local normalizations. Here we show that, in the zero-temperature limit, a network trained to maximize pseudo-likelihood naturally implements an associative memory: if the training set is small, patterns become fixed-point attractors whose basins of attraction exceed those of any classical Hopfield rule. We explain quantitatively this effect on uncorrelated random patterns. Moreover, we show that, for different structured datasets coming from computer science (random feature model, MNIST), physics (spin glasses) and biology (proteins), as the number of training examples increases the learned network goes beyond memorization, developing meaningful attractors with non-trivial correlations with test examples, thus showing the ability to generalize. Our results therefore reveal pseudo-likelihood works both as an efficient inference tool and as a principled mechanism for memory and generalization.</p>

It is therefore important to develop robust protocols for characterizing the valley coupling. Here, we show that realistically sized samplings of valley energy distributions tend to dramatically overestimate the average valley coupling. But we find that knowledge of the valley phase, in addition to the valley splitting, can significantly improve our estimates. Motivated by this understanding, we propose a novel method to probe the valley phase landscape across the quantum well using simple $g$-factor measurements. An important calibration step in this procedure is to measure $g$ in a loop enclosing a valley vortex, where the valley phase winds by $\pm 2\pi$ around a zero of the valley splitting. This proposal establishes an important new tool for probing spin qubits, and it can be implemented in current experiments.</p>

            <p>The topological magnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT), with gapped topological surface state, is an attractive platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall and Axion insulator states. However, the experimentally observed surface state gaps fail to meet theoretical predictions, although the exact mechanism behind the gap suppression has been debated. Recent theoretical studies suggest that intrinsic antisite defects push the topological surface state away from the MBT surface, closing its gap and making it less accessible to scanning probe experiments. Here, we report on the local effect of defects on the MBT surface states and demonstrate that high defect concentrations lead to a displacement of the surface states well into the MBT crystal, validating the theorized mechanism. The local and global influence of antisite defects on the topological surface states are studied with samples of varying defect densities by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), and density functional theory (DFT). Our findings identify a combination of increased defect density and reduced defect spacing as the primary factors underlying the displacement of the surface states and suppression of surface gap, shedding light to further development of topological quantum materials.</p>

From this perspective, we study the dynamics of the Kuramoto model with quenched random couplings: the simplest oscillator ensemble with fully disordered interactions.

We show frequency entrainment is not realized in the thermodynamic limit and that chaotic dynamics are pervasive in parameter space. In the weak coupling regime, we find closed formulas for the frequency shift and the dissipativeness of the model. Interestingly, the largest Lyapunov exponent is found to exhibit the same asymptotic dependence on the coupling constant irrespective of the coupling asymmetry, within the numerical accuracy.</p>

            <p>We provide an overview of the methodology and fundamental principles associated with newly developed experimental technique -- scanning quantum-vortex microscopy [Hovhannisyan et al., Commun. Mater., vol. 6, 42 (2025)]. This approach appears promising for experimental studies of vortex pinning phenomena in superconducting films and nanodevices. In particular, we studied the magnetic properties of magnetron-sputtered niobium (Nb) films by low-temperature magnetic force microscopy. As the temperature approaches the superconducting critical temperature, the pinning potential caused by structural defects weakens; consequently, the attractive interaction between the magnetic tip of the cantilever and a single-quantum vortex begins to dominate. In this scenario the magnetic probe is capable of trapping a vortex during the scanning process. Because the dragged vortex continues interacting with structural defects, it serves as an efficient nano-probe to explore pinning potentials and visualize grain boundaries in granular Nb films, achieving resolutions (30 nm) comparable to the superconducting coherence length.</p>

            <p>Hafnia-based ferroelectrics are revolutionizing the data storage industry and the field of ferroelectrics, with improved materials and devices being reported monthly. However, full understanding and control has not been reached yet and the ideal material still needs to be found. Here we report ferroelectric hafnia-zirconia superlattices made out of zirconium-substituted hafnia (Hf$_{1-x}$Zr$_x$O$_2$) sublayers of varying stoichiometries alternating with pure ZrO$_2$ sublayers. It is observed that the ZrO$_2$ layers in these superlattices act as a booster for the total remnant polarization (P$_r$). By combining the benefits of the ZrO$_2$ layers and the added interfaces, which help prevent breakdown, we fabricate superlattices with a total 87.5% ZrO$_2$ content, exhibiting record polarizations with a 2P$_r$ value of 84 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ that can be cycled 10$^9$ times, while maintaining a 2P$_r$ > 20 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Next to these attractive properties, substitution of HfO$_2$ by the much more abundant ZrO$_2$ offers a significant step towards the sustainable application of these devices.</p>

            <p>Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moiré excitons provide a fertile territory for realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moiré excitons hybridize with photons to form moiré exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features. In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moiré excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moiré patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moiré polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moiré excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.</p>

            <h2>Doping Induced Magnetic and Electronic phase Transition in Ferrimagnetic Half-metallic Mn$_{4}$Al$_{11}$ Compound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujoy Datta, Prashant Singh</p>
            <p>The future of spintronic and semiconductor applications demands materials with tailored electronic and magnetic properties. This study uses density functional theory to investigate the electronic structure of the half-metallic compound Mn$_{4}$Al$_{11}$ under uniaxial strain and in its Ge-substituted derivatives. Strain analysis shows that although the half-metallic band-gap collapses under strain beyond $-2\%$, the ferrimagnetic character remains stable. Ge substitution at six inequivalent Al-sites in Mn$_{4}$Al$_{11}$ results in varying degrees of metallicity and magnetic properties. Substitution at Al$=(000)$ induces a metal-to-insulator transition with an indirect semiconducting gap of $0.14~ eV$. Bonding and hybridization analysis reveals that local Mn-Al interactions due to Ge substitution significantly modify the local electronic structure, causing both electronic and magnetic phase transitions. This work highlights the effectiveness of substitutional doping in tuning half-metallicity and magnetic properties in inorganic solids, enabling the design of materials for future technological applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Pandey, Snehasish Nandy, Pankaj Bhalla</p>
            <p>Polarizability plays an essential role in characterizing the key phenomena, such as the screening effects, collective excitations, and dielectric functions present in the system. In this study, we investigate the intraband and interband polarizability within the random phase approximation for the three-dimensional nodal line semimetals, specifically for Ca$_3$P$_2$ and ZrSiS. We find both intraband and interband contributions show tunable behavior with the chemical potential, which adds a resonance signature in the behavior of the polarizability. Further, in the long wavelength limit, the results reveal the quadratic dependence on the wave vector by the non-resonant intraband and interband parts of the polarizability. On the other hand, the resonant interband part gives a cubic dependence on the wave vector. In addition, the total polarizability is dominated by the intraband part in the low frequency regime, while in the mid and high frequency regimes, the interband part takes the lead. This study opens avenues for further theoretical and experimental exploration of frequency dependent dielectric properties, paving the way for potential applications in tunable plasmonic devices.</p>

            <p>We describe how quantum Monte Carlo calculations using the CASINO software can be accelerated using graphics processing units (GPUs) and OpenACC.

We present results for three- and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gases and ab initio simulations of bulk materials, showing that significant speedups of up to a factor of 2.5 can be achieved by the use of GPUs when several hundred particles are included in the simulations. The use of single-precision arithmetic can improve the speedup further without significant detriment to the accuracy of the calculations.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic Trapping of Tracer Particles Induced by Spatially Correlated Noise in Thermal Equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijie Huang, Ayush Saurabh, Steve Presse</p>
            <p>We investigate the fluctuating Stokes equation in the presence of spatially correlated noise -- characterized by a single length scale -- while preserving thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends nonmonotonically on the ratio $\ell/r$ between the correlation length $\ell$ and the particle radius $r$: the MSD decreases as $\ell$ approaches $r$, reaches a minimum near $\ell\simeq r$, and rises again for $\ell > r$. The initial suppression stems from transient trapping, where sluggish momentum diffusion at short wavelengths confines the particle. When $\ell>r$, the particle hops between traps and eventually recovers normal diffusion ($\text{MSD}\propto t$) consistent with the fact that momentum diffusion crosses over to the standard Laplacian at long wavelengths. We further illustrate that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equations, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</p>

            <p>Recently, "photovoltaic photographs" were proposed as a creative application of photovoltaic technologies, relevant in fields such as architecture or the automotive industry. In this application an image is created by light-induced patterning of the photoactive layer, causing a local change in the appearance of the solar cell. In order to further develop this concept, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanism underlying these local changes. Here, UV-VIS and infrared spectroscopic techniques, as well as Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, have been used to investigate the physico-chemical changes induced by this process in the photoactive layer of proof-of-concept photo-patterned dye-sensitized solar cells. We show that, for N719 photovoltaic photographs, TiO2 plays a crucial role and that the dye undergoes a multi-step chemical degradation, related to its isothiocyanate ligand. These insights are of importance for a better understanding of the photo-induced degradation of N719, a more substantiated control of the light-induced patterning process, and to design appropriate light-induced patterning techniques for other classes of solar cells.</p>

            <h2>Mass Transfer Through Vapor-Liquid Interfaces From Hydrodynamic Density Functional Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Bursik, F. Bender, R. Stierle, G. Bauer, J. Gross</p>
            <p>We assess the capabilities of hydrodynamic density functional theory (DFT) to predict mass transfer across vapor-liquid interfaces by studying the response of an initially equilibrated pure component vapor-liquid system to the localized insertion of a second component. Hydrodynamic DFT captures the effect of interfaces on the dynamics by modeling the chemical potential gradients of an inhomogeneous system based on classical DFT. Hydrodynamic DFT effectively connects molecular models with continuum fluid dynamics. Away from interfaces the framework simplifies to the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations. We employ Maxwell-Stefan diffusion with a generalized driving force to model diffusive molecular transport in inhomogeneous systems. For the considered Lennard--Jones truncated and shifted (LJTS) fluid, we utilize a non-local Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed truncated and shifted (PeTS) equation of state. The model provides noise-free partial densities and fluxes for the mass transfer near the interface, as well as profiles of these quantities across the interface. A comparison with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations shows that hydrodynamic DFT accurately predicts mass transfer across the interface, including microscopic phenomena such as the temporary enrichment and repulsion of the light boiling component at the interface. Combining generalized entropy scaling with generalized Maxwell-Stefan diffusion allows for an accurate description of diffusive molecular transport in the system. This approach can accurately predict phase behavior, equilibrium interfaces, and mass transfer across interfaces based on molecular interactions for mixtures of strongly dissimilar components. Our results suggest that hydrodynamic DFT can accurately predict the dynamics of mixtures at vapor-liquid interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning Guided Multiscale Design of DNA-functionalized Nanoparticles for Targeted Self-Assembly of the Double Gyroid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Nieves-Rosado (1), Fernando Escobedo (1) ((1) Cornell University)</p>
            <p>In soft matter science, it is often the goal to design new materials with targeted properties. These materials can be used in many applications, each requiring specific features to be optimized for maximum fitness. The use of self-assembly processes, where a target structure is attained from suitably designed building blocks, is a powerful tool for this optimization. However, it is still an open question how to generally design realizable building blocks that lead to the desired phases. In this work, the double gyroid is chosen as target structure and DNA functionalized nanoparticles are used as our building blocks. Using existing pair potentials as inspiration, a large design space is defined for exploration of the target structure. An effective search strategy is implemented, where free energy calculations are first used to coarse grain our originally fine-grained model of the building blocks and then quickly evaluate the fitness of each design. These data are then fed into a machine learning algorithm that allows obtaining predictions for all candidates in our design space through an active learning loop. Successful coarse-grained designs are identified and evaluated again through interfacial pinning calculations with the fine-grained model. This work leads to the development of specific, experimentally relevant designs of DNA functionalized nanoparticles that self-assembly into the target phase. The methodology used can be extended to other types of building blocks and target structures.</p>

            <p>Wet-chemistry synthesized Gold nanourchins (Au NUs), characterized by spiky morphologies with spherical cores, exhibit complex and geometry-dependent plasmonic properties distinct from those of symmetrical nanostructures. While plasmon hybridization and mode coupling in branched nanostructures have been broadly studied, the specific optical behavior of Au NUs-particularly regarding spike length distribution and ultrafast dynamics-remains underexplored. This study investigates the steady-state and transient absorption spectra of Au NUs with 50-80 nm cores and 5-20 nm spikes, revealing multiple resonance bands. Transient absorption spectroscopy at various excitation wavelengths confirmed the presence of distinct resonances. Electromagnetic simulations based on TEM tomography-inspired models identified two key extinction bands: a green-wavelength dark mode resonance and a red-nIR spike-induced resonance attributed to the lightning rod effect. Simulations further showed that short, uniformly distributed spikes (aspect ratio <= 1) weakly excite dark resonances, while longer spikes (aspect ratio > 1) induce hybridized longitudinal resonances and significant redshifts. Broad spike length distributions result in multiple coexisting resonances, aligning with experimental extinction spectra. A preliminary surface-enhanced Raman scattering study using 2-naphthalene thiol confirmed stronger enhancement for long-spiked Au NUs under 785 nm excitation, validating the field enhancement potential of the identified resonances.</p>

            <h2>Latent Thermodynamic Flows: Unified Representation Learning and Generative Modeling of Temperature-Dependent Behaviors from Limited Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunrui Qiu, Richard John, Lukas Herron, Pratyush Tiwary</p>
            <p>Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work, we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow, important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive computational results.</p>

Because the size and spacing of holes can readily be controlled on all relevant length scales, this gives the opportunity to create designer surface plasmons with almost arbitrary dispersion in frequency and in space, opening new vistas in surface plasmon optics.</p>

            <p>Low-noise and tunable single-photon sources are essential components of photonic quantum technologies. However, in WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, charge noise from fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment remains a major obstacle to achieving transform-limited single-photon emission and high photon indistinguishability. Here, we systematically investigate two noise mitigation strategies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation and electrostatic biasing. We demonstrate that hBN encapsulation alone suppresses spectral wandering (from $\sim$170 $\mu$eV to $\sim$40 $\mu$eV) and narrows emission linewidths (from $\sim$500 $\mu$eV to $\sim$150 $\mu$eV), while applied bias enables stable Stark tuning over a 280 $\mu$eV range and further linewidth narrowing down to $\sim$100 $\mu$eV reaching the resolution-limited regime. Time-resolved and second-order correlation measurements confirm stable mono-exponential decay and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0) \approx 0.01$) with no observable blinking. To quantify progress toward the transform limit, we define two figures of merit: the linewidth ratio $R = W_{\text{exp}} / W_{\text{rad}}$ and total broadening $\Delta W = W_{\text{exp}} - W_{\text{rad}}$, with both being reduced more than five-fold in optimized devices. These results provide a robust framework for developing and evaluating low-noise, tunable WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, potentially realizing electrically controllable sources of indistinguishable single-photons for future photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling temperature and Reynolds number effects in quantum turbulence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Ignacio Polanco, Philippe-E. Roche, Luminita Danaila, Emmanuel Lévêque</p>
            <p>The interplay between viscous and frictional dissipation is key to understanding quantum turbulence dynamics in superfluid $^4$He. Based on a coarse-grained two-fluid description, an original scale-by-scale energy budget that identifies each scale's contribution to energy dissipation is derived. Using the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) model to further characterize mutual friction, direct numerical simulations at temperatures $1.44 \, \mathrm{K} \lesssim T \lesssim 2.16 \, \mathrm{K}$ indicate that mutual friction promotes intense momentum exchanges between the two fluids to maintain a joint energy cascade despite their viscosity mismatch. However, the resulting overall frictional dissipation remains small (compared to the viscous dissipation) and confined to far-dissipative scales. This remarkable feature allows us to define an effective Reynolds number for the turbulence intensity in a two-fluid system, helping to disentangle the effects of Reynolds number and temperature in quantum turbulence. Thereby, simple physical arguments predict that the distance $\ell$ between quantized vortices (normalized by the turbulence integral scale $L_0$) should behave as $\ell/L_0 \approx 0.5 \, \mathrm{Re}_\kappa^{-3/4}$ with the Reynolds number based on the quantum of circulation $\kappa$. This law is well supported by a large set of experimental and numerical data within the temperature range of the HVBK model. Finally, this new approach offers the possibility of revisiting the ongoing controversy on intermittency in quantum turbulence. It is shown that observed changes in intermittency arise from Reynolds number effects rather than from temperature variations, as proposed in recent studies.</p>

            <p>Germanium spin qubits exhibit strong spin-orbit interaction, which allow for high-fidelity qubit control, but also provide a strong dependence on the magnetic field. Superconducting vector magnets are often used to minimize dephasing due to hyperfine interactions and to maximize spin control, but these compromise the sample space and thus challenge scalability. Here, we explore whether a permanent magnet outside the cryostat can be used as an alternative. Operating in a hybrid mode with an internal and external magnet, we find that we can fine-tune the magnetic field to an in-plane orientation. We obtain a qubit dephasing time T2*=13 microseconds, Hahn-echo times T2H=88 microseconds, and an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity above 99.9%, from which we conclude that room temperature magnets allow for high qubit performance. Furthermore, we probe the qubit resonance frequency using only the external magnet, with the internal superconducting magnet switched off. Our approach may be used to scale semiconductor qubits and use the increased sample space for the integration of cryogenic control circuitry and wiring to advance to large-scale quantum processors.</p>

            <p>We formulate a spatial extension of the Leggett-Garg inequality by considering three distant observers locally measuring a many-body system at three subsequent times. The spatial form, in particular, is specially suited to analyze propagation of quantum perturbations through spin chains, by capturing how a measurement at one site can later affect distant sites due to the interactions. We illustrate our proposal for a Heisenberg chain in a magnetic field, showing indeed that the first inequality-violation time scales proportionally to the distance between measuring parties. We attribute this phenomenon to Lieb-Robinson physics and, confirming this connection, we find that violations are anticipated when increasing the interaction range. The inequality violation, readily observable in current experiments, demonstrates the incompatibility between two-point correlation functions and the macrorealistic hypothesis. In outlook, spatial Leggett-Garg inequalities constitute a new tool for analyzing the non-relativistic dynamics of many-body quantum systems.</p>

This approach entails a fully complex treatment of orbitals and quasiparticle energies in a non-Hermitian setting. We validate our CAP-$GW$ implementation by applying it to the prototypical shape resonances of \ce{N2^-}, \ce{CO^-}, \ce{CO_2^-}, \ce{C2H2-}, \ce{C2H4-}, and \ce{CH2O-}.

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks To Inverse Design Metasurfaces For Incident Angle-Independent Unidirectional Transmission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreeraj Rajan Warrier, Jayasri Dontabhaktuni</p>
            <p>Optimization of metasurface designs for specific functionality is a challenging problem due to the intricate relation between structural features and electromagnetic responses. Recently, many researchers resolved to inverse design of metasurfaces for efficient design parameters based on methods such as parameter optimization, evolutionary optimization and machine learning. In this paper a hybrid quantum machine learning method which uses quantum encoders to enhance the performance of a classical GAN is applied to implement inverse design of a metasurface. Aiming towards angle-independent unidirectional transmission, this approach combines a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to optimize metasurface designs. Incident-angle independent uni-directional transmission has potential applications in efficient solar cells, thermal cooling, non-reciprocal devices, etc. However, it is very challenging to achieve such a metasurface design via forward methods and hence very few studies exist till now in this direction. The methodology employed in this work reduces the data requirement for inverse design by 30% compared to conventional GAN-based methods. More importantly, the developed metasurface designs show high fidelity of 95% with regard to the targeted far-field radiation patterns. We also provide a material look-up table for feasible substitutes of the obtained material design with real materials and yet maintaining performance accuracy. Further, we embed the inverse-designed metasurfaces into Perovskite solar cell layers to demonstrate the improvement in its performance. We observe that the conversion efficiency of the example perovskite solar cell improves by 95% and remains independent of incident angle in the range -60$^\circ$ to 60$^\circ$ within the desired frequency range.</p>

We investigate the dynamic behaviour of elastic, chemically propelled phoretic filaments, combining two existing models; a local version of slender phoretic theory, which determines the resulting slip flows for chemically propelled filaments with a given shape and chemical patterning, is paired with an efficient method for capturing the elastohydrodynamics of a deformable filament in viscous flow to study the chemoelastohydrodynamics of filaments. As the activity increases, or equivalently the filament stiffness decreases, these filaments undergo buckling instabilities that alter their behaviour from rigid rods. We follow their behaviour well beyond the buckling threshold to find a rich array of dynamics, including motions that may be described as planar swimming, circling, pinwheeling, flapping and diffusive.</p>

            <p>The field of superconducting qubits is constantly evolving with new circuit designs. However, when it comes to qubit readout, the use of simple transverse linear coupling remains overwhelmingly prevalent. This standard readout scheme has significant drawbacks: in addition to the Purcell effect, it suffers from a limitation on the maximal number of photons in the readout mode, which restricts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) nature of the readout. Here, we explore the high-power regime by engineering a nonlinear coupling between a transmon qubit and its readout mode. Our approach builds upon previous work by Dassonneville et al. [Physical Review X 10, 011045 (2020)], on qubit readout with a non-perturbative cross-Kerr coupling in a transmon molecule. We demonstrate a readout fidelity of 99.21% with 89 photons utilizing a parametric amplifier. At this elevated photon number, the QND nature remains high at 96.7%. Even with up to 300 photons, the QNDness is only reduced by a few percent. This is qualitatively explained by deriving a critical number of photons associated to the nonlinear coupling, yielding a theoretical value of $\bar{n}_r^\text{crit} = 377$ photons for our sample's parameters. These results highlight the promising performance of the transmon molecule in the high-power regime for high-fidelity qubit readout.</p>

            <h2>Universal quantum melting of quasiperiodic attractors in driven-dissipative cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline Nowoczyn, Ludwig Mathey, Kilian Seibold</p>
            <p>Nonlinear classical mechanics has established countless intriguing and profound phenomena. These include limit tori defined by toroidal attractors that support quasiperiodic motion of at least two incommensurate frequencies. Here we address the question, whether and how such phenomena persist in open quantum systems. We develop a quantum description of limit tori within the Lindblad master-equation formalism for a system of two coupled driven-dissipative Kerr cavities. Using the spectral theory of the Liouvillian and the truncated Wigner approximation, we analyze the system across the quantum-to-classical transition. In the classical limit, we identify two pairs of purely imaginary Liouvillian eigenvalues, corresponding to persistent quasiperiodic modes of the limit torus. Quantum fluctuations induce small negative real parts to these eigenvalues, giving rise to finite lifetimes of these modes. The corresponding Liouvillian gaps vanish algebraically in the classical limit. This behavior signals a genuine continuous dynamical phase transition, marked by the spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry. Analysis of individual quantum trajectories reveals quantum-fluctuation-induced dephasing as the primary mechanism behind this "quantum melting" of the torus. We quantify this dephasing using a circular-variance-based order parameter, revealing universal scaling with both system size and time. These scaling laws are robust and independent of microscopic parameters. Our results establish the quantum melting of limit tori as a distinct non-equilibrium critical phenomenon and provide concrete signatures for experimental observation in trapped ions and superconducting circuits.</p>

For a periodic (Floquet) non-unitary evolution, such circuits are exactly tractable and admit volume-to-area law transitions. We show that breaking time-translation symmetry down to a quasiperiodic (Fibonacci) time evolution leads to the emergence of a critical phase with tunable effective central charge and with a fractal origin. Furthermore, for some classes of random non-unitary circuits, we demonstrate the robustness of the volume-to-area law phase transition for arbitrary random realizations, thanks to the emergent compactness of the classical map encoding the circuit's dynamics.</p>

            <p>We develop a conformal geometric model for grain boundaries in graphene based on a periodic line of alternating disclinations. Within the framework of (2+1)-dimensional gravity, we solve a reduced form of the Einstein equations to determine the conformal factor, from which the induced metric, scalar curvature, and holonomy are obtained analytically. Each pentagon-heptagon pair is modeled as a disclination dipole, forming a continuous distribution that captures the geometric signature of experimentally observed 5-7 grain boundaries. We show that the curvature is localized near the defect line and that the geometry becomes asymptotically flat, with trivial holonomy at large distances. This construction provides a tractable and physically consistent realization of the Katanaev-Volovich framework, connecting topological defect theory with atomistic features of graphene.</p>

            <p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases. However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+ angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to 128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rik S. Breebaart, Gianmarco Lazzeri, Roberto Covino, Peter G. Bolhuis</p>
            <p>Understanding mechanisms of rare but important events in complex molecular systems, such as protein folding or ligand (un)binding, requires accurately mapping transition paths from an initial to a final state. The committor is the ideal reaction coordinate for this purpose, but calculating it for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems has long been considered intractable. Here, we introduce an iterative path sampling strategy for computing the committor function for systems with high free energy barriers. We start with an initial guess to define isocommittor interfaces for transition interface sampling. The resulting path ensemble is then reweighted and used to train a neural network, yielding a more accurate committor model. This process is repeated until convergence, effectively solving the long-standing circular problem in enhanced sampling where a good reaction coordinate is needed to generate efficient sampling, and vice-versa. The final, converged committor model can be interrogated to extract mechanistic insights. We demonstrate the power of our method on a benchmark 2D potential and a more complex host-guest (un)binding process in explicit solvent.</p>

            <p>We theoretically analyze the Photosystem II reaction center using a quantum master equation approach, where excitonic and charge-transfer rates are computed at the Redfield and Förster levels with realistic spectral densities. The focus is on ergotropy, the maximum work extractable from a quantum state without energy loss. We compute the ergotropy by constructing passive states in the thermodynamic sense. Among the electron transfer pathways, those involving charge separation between $Chl_{D1}$ and $Phe_{D1}$, as well as a route passing through three sequential charge-separated states, yield higher ergotropy, suggesting greater capacity for work extraction, akin to quantum energy capacitors. A third pathway, bypassing the $Chl_{D1},Phe_{D1}$ pair, shows significantly reduced ergotropy. These differences arise from population-induced transitions between active and passive regimes. Our findings highlight how biological systems may exploit non-equilibrium population structures to optimize energy conversion, connecting quantum thermodynamic principles to biological energy harvesting.</p>

            <p>The enhancement of power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of single-junction solar cells is a key objective in the advancement of hot carrier solar cells. Recent findings indicate that quantum wells (QWs) can effectively generate hot carriers by confining charged carriers within their potential wells and by optimizing material properties. Here, we investigate the impact of quantum confinement on the thermodynamic properties of photogenerated hot carriers in p-i-n InGaAs/InAlAs heterostructure diodes, utilizing QW thicknesses of 4 nm, 5.5 nm, and 7.5 nm. The optical properties of these nanostructures reveal significant hot carrier effects at various lattice temperatures, with a pronounced effect noted at lower temperatures. The experimental results indicate that the widest QW exhibits stronger hot carrier effects than the thinner QWs. Additionally, the open-circuit voltage of the samples demonstrates a correlation with the degree of quantum confinement, mirroring trends observed in the quasi-Fermi level splitting of hot carriers. However, the magnitudes recorded exceed the bandgap of the quantum structures, suggesting that this behavior may be influenced by the barrier layer. Furthermore, the short-circuit current of the samples reveals a strong dependence on excitation power, but not on the degree of quantum confinement. This indicates that the majority of the photocurrent is generated in the barrier, with negligible contributions from photogenerated carriers within the QWs. This study provides insights into the role of quantum confinement on the opto-electrical properties of non-equilibrium hot carrier populations in QW structures.</p>

            <h2>Model selection for stochastic dynamics: a parsimonious and principled approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andonis Gerardos</p>
            <p>This thesis focuses on the discovery of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) from noisy and discrete time series. A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible correct model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard information criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited. We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information criterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\mathcal{B} \ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of candidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model ($n_\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance threshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more parameters than necessary when comparing many models. Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for SDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC, cross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model identification and predictive capability. Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals ($\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\sigma$), which can impair model learning and selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants of PASTIS, PASTIS-$\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\sigma$, thus extending the applicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data. PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical methodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with stochastic dynamics.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling, feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment on the utility of transfer learning.</p>

            <p>The XY spin chain is a paradigmatic example of a model solved by free fermions, in which the energy eigenspectrum is built from combinations of quasi-energies. In this article we show that by extending the XY model's anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ to complex values, it is possible for two of the quasi-energies to become degenerate. In the non-Hermitian XY model these quasi-energy degeneracies give rise to exceptional points (EPs) where two of the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The distinct $\lambda$ values at which EPs appear form concentric rings in the complex plane which are shown in the infinite system size limit to converge to the unit circle coinciding with the boundary between distinct topological phases. The non-Hermitian model is also seen to possess a line of broken $PT$ symmetry along the pure imaginary $\lambda$-axis. For finite systems, there are four EP values on this broken $PT$-symmetric line if the system size is a multiple of 4.</p>

The justification of this ensemble model relies on the conjecture that almost all states with constant flux correspond to turbulence states. To verify this conjecture, a numerical search for states with constant enstrophy flux in wavenumber space over finite time intervals in two-dimension turbulence is conducted using a Monte Carlo method. Properties of the obtained states, such as energy spectrum and spectra related to fourth-order moments, are examined and compared with those of turbulence states obtained from direct numerical simulations. The dependence of the obtained states on the time interval and the initial conditions used in the numerical search is also discussed.</p>

While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</p>

            <p>Understanding how quasi-particles interact with impurities is crucial for unveiling novel properties of quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the enhanced scattering between electrons and magnetic impurities in the low-energy limit, which gives rise to the Kondo effect. In this letter, motivated by recent developments in quantum simulation platforms, we investigate the universal behavior of long-range quantum spin chains with a single local impurity, focusing on systems that conserve the magnon number. Using effective field theory, we show that distinct classes of universal three-magnon states can emerge when the impurity-mediated two-magnon interaction is on resonance. When the long-range coupling decays as $1/r^\alpha$, we find that (i) for $\alpha\in (2,2.89)$, the system exhibits Efimov effects, with the three-body binding energy forming a geometric series $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-n (\alpha-1) \pi/s_0(\alpha)$, (ii) for $\alpha=2$, the system shows semi-super Efimov effects with $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-(n\pi-\theta)^2/8$. Our theoretical prediction is validated by the numerical solution of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation. Our results could be tested experimentally in the future on quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <p>Understanding how fluctuations arise and spread in the international trade system can help assess the current state and guide future developments. We analyze the world trade data to investigate strong adverse fluctuations, characterized here as `collapsed trades' -- individual trades that experience significant declines in annual trade volume compared to the previous year. Adopting a hypergraph framework for a fine-scale trade-centric representation of international trade, we find that collapsed trades are clustered similar to infectious disease outbreaks in societies. Moreover, the portion of collapsed trades is found to be negatively correlated with trade volume. We develop a collapse propagation model, an epidemic-like model with a weight-dependent infection rate, that reproduces all the essential empirical features. Through both analytical and numerical analysis, we identify two key factors that synergistically suppress the onset of global collective collapse and serve as a joint stabilizing mechanism for the international economy: i) a positive correlation between a trade's degree (the number of adjacent trades) and its volume and ii) an algebraically decaying infection rate with trade volume. In particular, the second factor weakened during the 2008--2009 global economic recession, possibly explaining the broader spread of collapse.</p>

            <p>The mixing of two different gases is one of the most common natural phenomena, with applications ranging from CO$_2$ capture to water purification. Traditionally, mixing is analyzed in the context of local thermal equilibrium, where systems exchange energy with a heat bath. Here, we study mixing in an isolated system with potentially non-equilibrium initial states, characterized solely by macroscopic observables. We identify the entropy of mixing as a special case of observational entropy within an observer-dependent framework, where both entropy and extractable work depend on the resolution of measurement. This approach naturally resolves the Gibbs mixing paradox in quantum systems: while an observer experiences a discontinuous increase in entropy upon learning of the existence of two particle types, this knowledge does not provide an advantage in work extraction if the types of particles remain operationally indistinguishable in their measurements. Finally, we derive a Landauer-like bound on the difference in energy extracted by two observers, where an "observational temperature" emerges, determined by the accessible information. These results provide a foundation for rigorously determining the energy required to unmix in non-equilibrium settings and extend beyond quantum systems, offering insights into the thermodynamics of isolated classical gases.</p>

            <p>In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an "entangler" and a "disentangler", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.</p>

We investigate spontaneous and laser-assisted electronic bridge schemes for different charge compensation mechanisms. While the calculated spontaneous electronic bridge rates are very small, laser-assisted electronic bridge schemes for nuclear (de)excitation turn out to be significantly more efficient than both spontaneous nuclear decay and direct laser excitation, offering promising prospects for the future clock operation.</p>

To facilitate this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500 devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently, fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models, including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination ($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters simultaneously.

            <p>Efficient signal representation is essential for the functioning of living and artificial systems operating under resource constraints. A widely recognized framework for deriving such representations is the information bottleneck method, which yields the optimal strategy for encoding a random variable, such as the signal, in a way that preserves maximal information about a functionally relevant variable, subject to an explicit constraint on the amount of information encoded. While in its general formulation the method is numerical, it admits an analytical solution in an important special case where the variables involved are jointly Gaussian. In this setting, the solution predicts discrete transitions in the dimensionality of the optimal representation as the encoding capacity is increased. Although these signature transitions, along with other features of the optimal strategy, can be derived from a constrained optimization problem, a clear and intuitive understanding of their emergence is still lacking. In our work, we advance our understanding of the Gaussian information bottleneck method through multiple mutually enriching perspectives, including geometric and information-theoretic ones. These perspectives offer novel intuition about the set of optimal encoding directions, the nature of the critical points where the optimal number of encoding components changes, and about the way the optimal strategy navigates between these critical points. We then apply our treatment of the method to a previously studied signal prediction problem, obtaining new insights on how different features of the signal are encoded across multiple components to enable optimal prediction of future signals. Altogether, our work deepens the foundational understanding of the information bottleneck method in the Gaussian setting, motivating the exploration of analogous perspectives in broader, non-Gaussian contexts.</p>

            <h2>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David E. Evans, Corey Jones</p>
            <p>We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Guided Dual Implicit Neural Representations for Source Separation</h2>

            <p>Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this, we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.</p>

            <h2>Stealthy-Hyperuniform Wave Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Photonic Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Barsukova, Zeyu Zhang, Brian Gould, Koorosh Sadri, Christian Rosiek, Søren Stobbe, Jonas Karcher, Mikael C. Rechtsman</p>
            <p>Hyperuniform structures are spatial patterns whose fluctuations disappear on long length scales, making them effectively homogeneous when observed from afar. Mathematically, this means that their spectral density, $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, approaches zero for low wavenumber, $|\textbf{k}|$. Crystalline lattices are hyperuniform, as are certain quasicrystals, maximally random jammed packing of spheres, and electrons in the fractional quantum Hall state. Stealthy-hyperuniformity is an even stronger constraint on the spectral density: it requires that $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$ is strictly zero in a finite range of wavevectors around $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}$, called the stealthy regime, or exclusion region. Since the degree of scattering by disorder is, to leading order, proportional to $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, waves propagating through such structures may do so without scattering for sufficiently long wavelengths and short distances. Here, we measure scattering by disorder in photonic crystal slabs with stealthy-hyperuniform disorder by measuring the linewidths of the photonic bands. We observe the transition between the stealthy and non-stealthy regimes, marked by a sharp increase in linewidth. We also observe the effects of multiple scattering in the stealthy regime, which implies diminishing transparency. Moreover, we show that residual single scattering in the stealthy regime arises from an intrinsically non-Hermitian effect: propagating light has a complex effective mass due to radiative loss out of the slab.</p>

            <h2>Circuit complexity and functionality: a thermodynamic perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Chamon, Andrei E. Ruckenstein, Eduardo R. Mucciolo, Ran Canetti</p>
            <p>Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem [1,2,3]. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (``wormhole'') connecting the two sides of an AdS ``eternal'' black hole [4]. Here we are motivated by an independent set of considerations and explore links between complexity and thermodynamics for functionally-equivalent circuits, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides a new perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length -- an important problem in cryptography -- as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with ``gases of gates''. This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits of same size and functionality that cannot be connected via a polynomial number of local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide.</p>

            <p>Acoustic metamaterials have gained popularity as promising materials for enhancing noise reduction. Here, we explore the use of metamaterials, based on Helmholtz resonators (HRs), to enhance the performance of standard clay hollow brick. By incorporating HRs in the upper and lower hollows, we transform the standard brick into metaBrick, which is essentially designed based on metamaterial principles. We evaluate the acoustic and thermal performance of walls constructed with clay metaBricks, focusing on sound transmission loss and heat resistance. Both the finite element method and experimental analysis were employed to highlight the performance of metaBricks compared to standard clay bricks. Results show that metaBricks significantly enhance acoustic and thermal insulation, achieving an attenuation of $20$ \si{dB} across a broad frequency range from $500$ to $2500$ \si{Hz} and an $8$\% increase in thermal resistance. However, compressive strength is reduced by $33$\%, though it remains above the standard requirements for building materials. These findings indicate that metaBrick is a promising building material, offering improved sound and thermal insulation.</p>

Using group theory analysis in the framework of topological quantum chemistry, we find fragile bands near the Fermi level for all the materials studied. Since stable topological bands are also present in these systems, the interplay of both phases is discussed, showing that corner charges appear in over 80% of the materials and are linked to fragile topology. Using first-principles calculations, we predict fractionally-charged corner charges protected by $C_3$ symmetry. Our work aims to broaden the scope of materials with experimentally accessible fragile bands.</p>

            <p>A biorthonormal-block density-matrix renormalization group algorithm is proposed to accurately compute properties of large-scale non-Hermitian many-body systems, in which a renormalized-space partition of the non-Hermitian reduced density matrix is implemented to fulfill the prerequisite for the biorthonormality of the renormalization group (RG) transformation and to optimize the construction of saved Hilbert spaces. A redundancy in saved spaces of the reduced density matrix is exploited to reduce a condition number resulting from the non-unitarity of the left and right transformation matrices, in order to ensure the numerical stability of the RG procedure. The algorithm is successfully applied to an interacting fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nonreciprocal hoppings and staggered complex chemical potential, exhibiting novel many-body phenomena.</p>

            <p>Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated nanoparticles derived from natural cellulose, with potential applications ranging from rheological modifiers and emulsion stabilizers to photonic pigments and sensors. For most applications, precise control over CNC morphology and surface chemistry is essential, but the relationship between process parameters, CNC characteristics, and their resulting behavior is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of centrifugation and ionic strength on CNC morphology after dialysis using transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron diffraction. We find that the centrifugation step commonly applied during CNC purification promotes the formation of compact composite nanoparticles made of aligned crystallites, referred to as 'bundles', that are associated preferentially along their hydrophobic faces. In stark contrast, transient exposure to high ionic strength leads to fractal-like, irregular composite nanoparticles. We then examine the consequence of these morphological differences on the cholesteric self-organization of the CNCs: aligned bundles reduce the cholesteric pitch in suspension, causing a blue-shift in the color of dish-cast photonic films, while misaligned particles promote gelation, producing colorless films. This study reveals the importance of sample history, in particular, the often-disregarded purification steps, on CNC characteristics and their ensemble behavior, thereby unlocking new routes for tailoring this promising nanomaterial.</p>

            <p>Feynman diagrams are an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, stochastic quantum Monte Carlo sampling suffers from the sign problem, particularly when solving a multiorbital quantum impurity model. Recently, two approaches have been proposed for efficient numerical treatment of Feynman diagrams: Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) to replace stochastic sampling and the Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) representation for compressing space-time dependence. One of the remaining challenges is the nontrivial task of identifying low-rank structures in weak-coupling Feynman diagrams for multiorbital electron-phonon systems. In particular, the traditional TCI algorithm faces an ergodicity problem, which prevents it from fully exploring the multiorbital space. To address this, we incorporate a new algorithm called global search, which resolves this issue. By combining this approach with QTT, we uncover low-rank structures and achieve efficient numerical integration with exponential resolution in time and faster-than-power-law convergence of error relative to computational cost. Additionally, our approach does not require the division of discontinuous regions necessary in non-quantics TCI.</p>

            <h2>Thermally-induced mimicry of quantum cluster excitations and implications for the magnetic transition in FePSe$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry Lane, Martin Mourigal</p>
            <p>In two dimensional magnets, the interplay of thermal fluctuations and spin anisotropy control the existence of long-range magnetic order. In the van der Waals antiferromagnets FePX$_3$, orbital degeneracy in the $t2g$ levels of the Fe$^{2+}$ ions in octahedral coordination yields strong uniaxial anisotropy, which stabilizes magnetic order up to T$\approx$100 K. Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements around the magnetic ordering transition have shown the existence of a broad spectrum of magnetic fluctuations with nontrivial momentum dependence, which has been interpreted as evidence for localized entangled cluster excitations. In this paper, we offer an alternative interpretation using classical nonlinear spin dynamics simulations. We present stochastic Landau Lifshitz dynamics simulations that reproduce the neutron scattering measurements of Chen et al. [npj Quantum Mater. 9, 40 (2024)] on FePSe$_3$. These calculations faithfully explain the dynamical structure factor's momentum and energy dependence and point to a classical origin for the excitations observed in neutron spectroscopy and that the order-disorder transition can be understood in terms of thermal fluctuations overcoming the anisotropy energy.</p>

            <p>Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports soft magnon modes. In particular, we show that these soft modes can mediate pairing through inter-band scattering events that are symmetry-forbidden in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, thus providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sangyun Lee, Jae Sung Lee, Jong-Min Park</p>
            <p>As a fundamental thermodynamic principle, speed limits reveal the lower bound of entropy production (EP) required for a system to transition from a given initial state to a final state. While various speed limits have been developed for continuous-time Markov processes, their application to discrete-time Markov chains remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the speed limits in discrete-time Markov chains, focusing on two types of EP commonly used to measure the irreversibility of a discrete-time process: time-reversed EP and time-backward EP. We find that time-reversed EP satisfies the speed limit for the continuous-time Markov processes, whereas time-backward EP does not. Additionally, for time-reversed EP, we derive practical speed limits applicable to systems driven by cyclic protocols or with unidirectional transitions, where conventional speed limits become meaningless or invalid. We show that these relations also hold for continuous-time Markov processes by taking the time-continuum limit of our results. Finally, we validate our findings through several examples.</p>

These states include Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states, both of which break inversion symmetry. We investigate the supercurrent properties and discover non-reciprocal supercurrents for both the Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states with distinct spatial dependencies. We propose that the supercurrent diode effect can serve as an experimental tool for distinguishing between different pair density waves in metallic altermagnets and discuss the relation to material candidates.</p>

            <p>In this work, we perform a combination of analytical and numerical studies on the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg chain in the region of negative Kitaev and positive Heisenberg couplings. Apart from the antiferromagnetic phase, we find a magnetically ordered phase with left-left-right-right order and a gapless phase with central charge value $c=1$, resolving the existing contradictory results in literature regarding this parameter region. In particular, the origin of the left-left-right-right order is clarified based on a perturbative Luttinger liquid analysis. The left-left-right-right phase is further shown to persist in the Kitaev-Heisenberg-Gamma model when a small nonzero Gamma interaction is introduced. Using a coupled-chain method, we also demonstrate that the one-dimensional (1D) left-left-right-right order gives a quasi-1D explanation for the 2D stripy order of the same model on the honeycomb lattice.</p>

            <p>We develop a systematic large-$N$ expansion based on the Schwinger boson representation of SU(4) coherent states of dimers for the paradigmatic spin-$1/2$ bilayer square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. This system exhibits a quantum phase transition between a quantum paramagnetic state and a Néel order state, driven by the coupling constant $g = J'/J$, which is defined as the ratio between the inter-dimer $J'$ and intra-dimer $J$ exchange interactions. We demonstrate that this approach accurately describes static and dynamic properties on both sides of the quantum phase transition. The critical coupling constant $g_c \approx 0.42$ and the dynamic spin structure factor reproduce quantum Monte Carlo results with high precision. Notably, the $1/N$ corrections reveal the longitudinal mode of the magnetically ordered phase along with the overdamping caused by its decay into the two-magnon continuum. The present large-$N$ $SU(N)$ Schwinger boson theory can be extended to more general cases of quantum paramagnets that undergo a quantum phase transition into magnetically ordered states.</p>

            <p>It was recently found that, going beyond the tendfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and violating the bulk-boundary correspondence of the usual topological phases, PT-invariant systems support a real Chern insulator with the so-called boundary criticality, which forbids the transition between different orders of topological phases accompanied by the closing and reopening of the bulk-band gap. Here, we fnd that the periodic driving can break the boundary criticality of a PT-invariant system. Setting free from the the boundary criticality, diverse first- and second-order topological phases absent in the static case are found in both the zero and Pi/T modes. The application of our result in the three-dimensional PT-invariant system permits us to discover exotic second-order Dirac and nodal-line semimetals with coexisting surface and hinge Fermi arcs. Enriching the family of the topological phases in PT-invariant systems, our result provides us a useful way to explore novel topological phases.</p>

            <p>The energy landscape plays a central role in understanding the dynamics of low-temperature and athermal systems, which are characterized by a plethora of minima and the intricate geometry of their basins of attraction. Due to their complexity, these landscapes resist analytical treatment and must instead be studied numerically. We focus on jammed soft spheres, a paradigmatic model of glasses and granulars, to expose the limitations of standard numerical methods in resolving the true structure of energy landscapes. We show that CVODE is the ODE solver with the best time-for-error trade-off, outperforming commonly used steepest-descent solvers by several orders of magnitude. Using this numerical approach, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies of soft sphere packings destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderately low dimensions. Employing a range of geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that earlier claims on the fractality of basins of attraction originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies. In reality, the basins of attraction of soft sphere packings are smooth structures with well-defined length scales.</p>

            <p>The ability to control the morphology of the nanotube deposit formed during the evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate is of theoretical and practical interest. Such deposits are required for various applications including nanotechnology, medicine, biotechnology, and optronics. In the experiment of Zhao et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 440, 68 (2015)], an annular deposit was formed near the contact line. The deposition geometry is caused by the coffee ring effect. This deposit is unusual in its morphology. It changes gradually in space from a disordered structure in the inner part of the ring to an aligned structure of nanotubes close to the periphery. To understand the mechanisms that lead to this, we have developed a mathematical model that takes into account the effects of advection, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions on particle transport. Results of numerical calculations have confirmed that all these factors together have an influence on the formation of such a variable morphology. Qualitative agreement with the experiment is shown for some values of the model parameters.</p>

            <p>Interactions between active individuals in animal collectives lead to emergent responses that remain elusive in synthetic soft matter. Here, shape-morphing polymers are used to create bio-inspired transient solids that self-assemble with controlled mechanical properties and disassemble on demand. Dilute-suspensions of magnetic, heat-responsive liquid crystal elastomer ribbons mechanically interlock, inducing reversible aggregation. A mathematical model is developed that sheds light on the role of topological mechanisms in aggregation. Aggregation was favored for ribbons with moderate curvature at 25C above crosslinking temperature as compared to flat ribbons or higher curvature ribbons at higher temperatures. The ribbon suspensions reversibly transition between fluid- and solid-like states, exhibiting up to 6 orders-of-magnitude increase in the storage moduli of the entangled aggregates compared with the liquid dispersions. Controlled dissociation is induced by imparting kinetic energy to the individual ribbons at high magnetic field rotation speeds (> 200 RPM). Ribbon shape and the medium in which dissociation occurs were shown to govern disassembly. Imparting dynamic collective behaviors into synthetic systems may enable a range of potential applications from bio-inspired soft robotics to injectable biomaterials.</p>

Although the zero resistance has been successfully achieved under improved hydrostatic pressure conditions, the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ under high pressure remains controversial. Here, using shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted on the culet of diamond anvils as in-situ quantum sensors, we observe compelling evidence for the Meissner effect in polycrystalline bilayer nickelate samples: the magnetic field expulsion during both field cooling and field warming processes. In particular, we explore the multiparameter measurement capacity of the diamond quantum sensors to extract the weak demagnetization signal of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$. The correlated measurements of Raman spectra and magnetic imaging indicate an incomplete structural transformation related to the displacement of oxygen ions emerging in the non-superconducting region. Our work clarifies the controversy about the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ and contributes to the development of quantum sensing of weak signals under high-pressure conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vanja Marić, Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti</p>
            <p>We consider translationally invariant quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains with local interactions and a discrete symmetry that is spontaneously broken at zero temperature. We envision experimenters switching off the couplings between two parts of the system and preparing them in independent equilibrium states. One side of the chain is prepared in a disordered phase, and the other in a symmetry-breaking ground state. When the couplings are switched back on, time evolution ensues. We argue that in integrable systems the front separating the ordered region recedes at the maximal velocity of quasiparticle excitations over the ground state. We infer that, generically, the order parameters should vary on a subdiffusive scale of order $t^{1/3}$, where $t$ is time, and their fluctuations should exhibit the same scaling. This interfacial region exhibits full range correlations, indicating that it cannot be decomposed into nearly uncorrelated subsystems. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a case study, we demonstrate that all order parameters follow the same universal scaling functions. Through an analysis of the skew information, we uncover that the breakdown of cluster decomposition has a quantum contribution: each subsystem within the interfacial region, with extent comparable to the region, exists in a macroscopic quantum state.</p>

Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be a one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single parameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously tuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this transition to catastrophe. In turn, prevention of rapid increase in the extremal event-driven rate of failure, in the interest of system preservation, causes the catastrophe regime to be strategically unfavorable.</p>

            <h2>Crystal Structure and Collective Oxygen Transport in the High-Temperature Phase of Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sung-Hoon Lee, Ki-Ha Hong</p>
            <p>In crystalline materials, atomic motion is typically confined to vibrations within a fixed lattice, with substantial movement generally associated with defect migration. Here, we report an extraordinary collective ionic transport pathway in the high-temperature tetragonal phase of tantalum pentoxide (H-Ta$_2$O$_5$), whose crystal structure has remained unresolved until now. Our density functional theory calculations unequivocally determine the tetragonal structure to possess a four-fold screw-symmetric configuration derived from the known orthorhombic phase. The proposed structure aligns excellently with experimental lattice constants and transmission electron microscopy observations, resolving longstanding ambiguities regarding the atomic arrangement of H-Ta$_2$O$_5$. Remarkably, ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal an unexpected ionic transport mechanism: coordinated, floating-like motion of specific oxygen atoms occurring at temperatures as low as 500 K. This collective oxygen motion beyond simple vibrations occurs within the stoichiometric lattice. The calculated energy barrier is exceptionally low (~0.2 eV), an order of magnitude below typical crystalline diffusion barriers. This drastic barrier reduction arises from flexible lattice coordination around screw-rotation planes, providing extensive positional flexibility and effectively dissipating local charge imbalances near oxygen pathways. Our findings elucidate the intriguing phenomena of intrinsic and anisotropic oxygen conductivity in H-Ta$_2$O$_5$ and offer valuable insights for designing novel crystalline materials with enhanced ionic mobility.</p>

            <p>The Laughlin state embodies a universal class of fractional quantum Hall effects arising in two-dimensional electron systems subjected to strong perpendicular magnetic fields. Conventionally described by a single-component wavefunction, the Laughlin state features fractionally charged quasiparticles arising from correlations within one electron species. Here, we explore a novel physical situation by introducing inter-species Coulomb coupling between two intra-species Laughlin states in a quantum Hall graphene bilayer structure. Although quasiparticle excitations typically exhibit charge gaps of tens of Kelvin, we observe that this energy scale is significantly lowered through interlayer excitonic pairing between quasiparticles and quasiholes. Identified via transport measurements, these excitons belong to an unprecedented category of charge-neutral anyons, opening a new avenue for investigating exotic quantum statistics and phases of matter.</p>

            <p>Valence bond (VB) states as the formation mechanism of Cooper pairs, eventually leading to high-temperature superconductivity, remain a controversial topic. Although various VB-like states find variational relevance in the description of specific spin models and quantum spin liquids, in the realm of many-body fermionic Hamiltonians, the evidence for such states as ground states wave functions remains elusive, challenging the valence-bond pairing mechanism. Here, we present evidence of a VB ground state with pairing tendencies, particularly at finite doping. We achieved this for the generic two-orbital Hubbard model in low dimension, where the VB states can be associated with the presence of the topological order manifested by edge states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcio S. Gomes-Filho, Eugene M. Terentjev</p>
            <p>Understanding and computing the entropic forces exerted by polymer chains under confinement is important for many reasons, from research to applications. However, extracting properties related to the free energy, such as the force (or pressure) on confining walls, does not readily emerge from conventional polymer dynamics simulations due to the entropic contributions inherent in these free energies. Here we propose an alternative method to compute such forces, and the associated free energies, based on empirically measuring the average force required to confine a polymer chain between parallel walls connected by an artificial elastic spring. This measurement enables us to interpolate the expression for the free energy of a confined self-avoiding chain and offer an analytical expression to complement the classical theory of ideal chains in confined spaces. Therefore, the significance of our method extends beyond the findings of this paper: it can be effectively employed to investigate the confinement free energy across diverse scenarios where all kinds of polymer chains are confined in a gap between parallel walls.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors CrSBr offer an ideal platform to achieve exciton-polaritons correlated with magnetic orders for developing solid-state quantum, spintronic, and photonic devices. However, for the exciton-polaritons formed by lower-energy excitons (XL = 1.37 eV), the coupling strength and nonlinear optical response are almost inert to the external magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate robust strong coupling between higher-energy excitons (XH = 1.8 eV) and photons that persists up to room temperature, along with giant magnetic-field tunability. The Rabi splitting energy is tuned up to 100 meV within a moderate 0.45 T in-plane magnetic field due to changes in excitonic states during the spin transitions. Besides, we observe significantly enhanced polariton nonlinearity in the intermediate magnetic phase, which exhibits a distinct mode-number dependence and originates from magnon-assisted long-range attractive interactions and coupling strength reduction. These results advance the development of on-demand polariton platforms for spin-correlated quantum optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>Titanium (Ti) is an adhesion and contact metal commonly used in nanoelectronics and two-dimensional (2D) materials research. However, when Ti is deposited on graphene (Gr), we obtain dramatically different film morphology depending on the experimental conditions. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio density functional theory calculations, we show that the most critical parameters are the number of Gr layers, the nature of the Gr support, and the deposition temperature. Particularly distinctive is the island morphology and large defect density of Ti on monolayer Gr, compared to bilayer or thicker Gr. We propose that this results from structural and mechanical differences between monolayer and thicker Gr flakes, where monolayer Gr is more flexible, exhibits larger surface roughness and therefore lower Ti diffusivity, and is more easily damaged. Our results highlight the extreme sensitivity of Ti morphology on Gr to processing and substrate conditions, allowing us to propose design rules for controlling Ti-Gr interface properties and morphology and to discuss the implications for other technologically relevant metal deposition processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Wang, Zhiqiang Wang, Qijin Chen, K. Levin</p>
            <p>While there are many different mechanisms which have been proposed to understand the physics behind light induced ``superconductivity", what seems to be common to the class of materials in which this is observed are strong pairing correlations, which are present in the normal state. Here we argue, that the original ideas of Eliashberg are applicable to such a pseudogap phase and that with exposure to radiation the fermions are redistributed to higher energies where they are less deleterious to pairing. What results then is a photo-induced state with dramatically enhanced number of nearly condensed fermion pairs. In this phase, because the a.c. conductivity, $\sigma(\omega) = \sigma_1(\omega) + i \sigma_2(\omega)$, is dominated by the bosonic contribution, it can be computed using conventional (Aslamazov Larkin) fluctuation theory. We, thereby, observe the expected fingerprint of this photoinduced ``superconducting" state which is a $1/\omega$ dependence in $\sigma_2$ with fits to the data of the same quality as found for the so-called photo-enhanced (Drude) conductivity scenario. Here, however, we have a microscopic understanding of the characteristic low energy scale which appears in transport and which is necessarily temperature dependent. This approach also provides insight into recent observations of concomitant diamagnetic fluctuations. Our calculations suggest that the observed light-induced phase in these strongly paired superconductors has only short range phase coherence without long range superconducting order.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the ongoing interest in understanding the actual magnetic ground state of the promising axion insulator candidate EuIn2As2, we present here a spin symmetry analysis and ab-initio calculations, aiming to identify specific exchange-dominated physics that could offer insights into the current debate. We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the helical and broken helical phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the broken helical phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our ab-initio calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound.</p>

YbBr$_3$ is an excellent realization of the $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, and we have performed detailed spectroscopic experiments with both unpolarized and polarized neutrons at all applied magnetic fields up to saturation. We observe extensive excitation continua, which cause strong renormalization and the decay of single magnons at higher fields, while coherent features include field-induced ``shadows'' of the single magnons and the spectacular emergence of a roton-like excitation. To guide and interpret our experiments, we performed systematic calculations by the method of cylinder matrix-product states that provide quantitative agreement with the neutron scattering data and a qualitative benchmark for the spectral signatures of strong quantum fluctuations even in the absence of magnetic frustration.</p>

            <h2>Thermal Quench Dynamics of Visons in Gapless Kitaev Spin Liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Yang, Gia-Wei Chern</p>
            <p>The relaxation dynamics of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a thermal quench is dominated by the quasi-stochastic diffusion and pair annihilation of visions, which are gapped flux excitations of an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field of the Kitaev spin liquid. Both the diffusion energy barrier as well as the effective interactions between visons are mediated by the Majorana fermions which are fractionalized quasiparticles of the spin liquid. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the interplay between the thermal diffusion and nonlocal multi-vision interactions leads to a variety of temperature-dependent dynamical behaviors ranging from diffusion-limited and terminal-velocity-limited annihilation to dynamical arresting and freezing. Notably, we show that the freezing phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of metastable $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ vison crystals and a hidden coarsening of super-clusters associated with a broken $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry.</p>

            <p>Smart active matter has the ability to control its motion guided by individual policies to achieve collective goals. We introduce a theoretical framework to study a decentralized learning process in which agents can locally exchange policies to adapt their behavior and maximize a predefined reward function. We use our formalism to derive explicit hydrodynamic equations for the policy dynamics. We apply the theory to two different microscopic models where policies correspond either to fixed parameters similar to evolutionary dynamics, or to state-dependent controllers known from the field of robotics. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and agent-based simulations. By deriving fundamental control parameters and uncertainty relations, our work lays the foundations for a statistical physics analysis of decentralized learning.</p>

            <h2>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier--phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier--phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the general explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring appropriate hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</p>

These have been previously shown to exhibit "Machian" dynamics where the motion of one particle requires the presence of others in its proximity, such that dynamics produces ergodicity breaking steady states characterized by clusters. In this work, we show that although the global state breaks ergodicity, a limited version of ergodic behavior is retained within the clusters which may or may not be chaotic, depending on the nature of the microscopic Hamiltonian. In certain cases, we show that the dynamics can be mapped to that of a billiards particle in various stadiums. We also show that the many-fracton trajectories characteristically exhibit a central time or "Janus point" and thus a generic nonequilibrium bidirectional arrow of time.</p>

By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon, as validated through density functional theory calculations. Moreover, the atoms in the split kite phase demonstrate distinct collective diffusion dynamics. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</p>

            <p>In statistical physics, phase transitions are arguably among the most extensively studied phenomena. In the computational approach to this field, the development of algorithms capable of estimating entropy across the entire energy spectrum in a single execution has highlighted the efficacy of microcanonical inflection point analysis, while Fisher's zeros technique has re-emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating these phenomena. This paper presents an alternative protocol for analyzing phase transitions using a parametrization of the entropy function in the microcanonical ensemble. We also provide a clear demonstration of the relation of the linear pattern of the Fisher's zeros on the complex inverse temperature map (a circle in the complex $x=e^{-\beta \varepsilon}$ map) with the order of the transition, showing that the latent heat is inversely related to the distance between the zeros. We study various model systems, including the Lennard-Jones cluster, the Ising, the XY, and the Zeeman models. By examining the behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and its derivatives in the microcanonical ensemble, we identify key features-such as loops and discontinuities in parametric curves-which signal phase transitions' presence and nature. This approach can facilitate the classification of phase transitions across various physical systems.</p>

            <h2>Unified description of viscous, viscoelastic, or elastic thin active films on substrates</h2>

            <p>It is frequent for active or living entities to find themselves embedded in a surrounding medium. Resulting composite systems are usually classified as either active fluids or active solids. Yet, in reality, particularly in the biological context, a broad spectrum of viscoelasticity exists in between these two limits. There, both viscous and elastic properties are combined. To bridge the gap between active fluids and active solids, we here systematically derive a unified continuum-theoretical framework. It covers viscous, viscoelastic, and elastic active materials. Our continuum equations are obtained by coarse-graining a discrete, agent-based microscopic dynamic description. In our subsequent analysis, we mainly focus on thin active films on supporting substrates. Strength of activity and degree of elasticity are used as control parameters that control the overall behavior. We concentrate on the analysis of transitions between spatially uniform analytical solutions of collective migration. These include isotropic and polar, orientationally ordered states. A stationary polar solution of persistent directed collective motion is observed for rather fluid-like systems. It corresponds to the ubiquitous swarming state observed in various kinds of dry and wet active matter. With increasing elasticity, persistent motion in one direction is prevented by elastic anchoring and restoring forces. As a consequence, rotations of the spatially uniform migration direction and associated flow occur. Our unified description allows to continuously tune the material behavior from viscous, via viscoelastic, to elastic active behavior by variation of a single parameter. Therefore, it allows in the future to investigate the time evolution of complex systems and biomaterials such as biofilms within one framework.</p>

            <p>We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of bond dissipation and disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial system is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial system strengthens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.</p>

We discuss progresses from the perspective of materials development and device implementation. Finally, we emphasize the major challenges that must be addressed for practical applications of these phase-change materials and provide our outlook on the future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

            <p>Machine-learned interatomic potentials are revolutionising atomistic materials simulations by providing accurate and scalable predictions within the scope covered by the training data. However, generation of an accurate and robust training data set remains a challenge, often requiring thousands of first-principles calculations to achieve high accuracy. Foundation models have started to emerge with the ambition to create universally applicable potentials across a wide range of materials. While foundation models can be robust and transferable, they do not yet achieve the accuracy required to predict reaction barriers, phase transitions, and material stability. This work demonstrates that foundation model potentials can reach chemical accuracy when fine-tuned using transfer learning with partially frozen weights and biases. For two challenging datasets on reactive chemistry at surfaces and stability and elastic properties of tertiary alloys, we show that frozen transfer learning with 10-20% of the data (hundreds of datapoints) achieves similar accuracies to models trained from scratch (on thousands of datapoints). Moreover, we show that an equally accurate, but significantly more efficient surrogate model can be built using the transfer learned potential as the ground truth. In combination, we present a simulation workflow for machine learning potentials that improves data efficiency and computational efficiency.</p>

Based on versatile microscopic models able to capture the altermagnetic sublattice degrees of freedom, we study characteristic local signatures of altermagnetism near disorder sites. We give a complete list of two-dimensional models that exhibit altermagnetism classified by their corresponding layer groups. Specifically, we calculate the local density of states in the vicinity of pointlike nonmagnetic impurities and expose its spatial dependence for two minimal models showcasing $d$-wave and $g$-wave altermagnetism. The momentum structure of the nodes ($d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc.) is directly imprinted on the total local density of states, thus measurable by scanning tunneling conductance experiments. This signature is present both in the spin-resolved as well as the spin-summed local density of states. We find a weaker response in the nonmagnetic state from the anisotropic crystal environment and uncover the importance of the sublattice degree of freedom to model altermagnets. We also study coexistence phases of altermagnetism and superconductivity and provide predictions for the local impurity response of in-gap bound states. The response of impurity bound states strongly enhances the distinct altermagnetic signature.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii theory for a spin-1 Bose gas: Application to superfluidity in two dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew P. C. Underwood, P. B. Blakie</p>
            <p>This paper develops and implements the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation for spin-1 Bose gases, addressing key considerations for numerical simulations. As an application of the theory we explore equilibrium phases in a two-dimensional spin-1 gas, where quasi-long-range order emerges via a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Our analysis includes definition of superfluid densities for both mass and spin degrees of freedom, in a manner suitable for implementation within a stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We present a finite-temperature phase diagram for the ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose gas and identify three distinct superfluid phases: two exhibiting conventional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like behavior and a novel phase that simultaneously supports independent mass and spin superflows. As temperature increases, the stability region of this novel phase shrinks. We provide characterization of the phase transitions through consideration of the spin-component densities and the unbinding of multiple types of vortices. This work provides a foundation for further studies of nonequilibrium and finite-temperature phenomena in spinor Bose gases.</p>

            <h2>Atomistic modeling of functionalized magnetite surfaces with oxidation states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emre Gürsoy, Robert H. Meißner, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer</p>
            <p>Understanding the atomic structure of magnetite-carboxylic acid interfaces is crucial for tailoring nanocomposites involving this interface. We present a Monte Carlo (MC)-based method utilizing iron oxidation state exchange to model magnetite interfaces with tens of thousands of atoms, scales typically inaccessible by electronic structure calculations. Charge neutrality is ensured by the oxidation of Fe ions. The MC approach allows magnetite to adapt to its environment at interfaces without requiring interface-specific rescaling of force-field parameters. This enables a simple, versatile method. By comparing adsorption sites, layer distances, and bond lengths with results from electronic structure calculations and experiments, we validated the accuracy of our method. We found that the oxidation state distribution and, consequently, binding site preference depend on coverage and surface thickness, with a critical thickness signaling the transition from layered to bulk-like oxidation states. The method ensures seamless compatibility with popular biomolecular force fields providing transferability and simplifying the study of magnetite interfaces in general.</p>

            <h2>Orbital splitter effect and spatial resolution of current-induced orbital accumulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niels Henrik Aase, Erik Wegner Hodt, Karl Bergson Hallberg, Asle Sudbø, Jacob Linder</p>
            <p>The emergence of an orbital angular momentum (OAM) response to a charge current holds promise for technological applications, allowing electrical control of magnetization dynamics. Often, the OAM current is invoked in explaining experimental results for very large orbital transport effects, but this is conceptually challenging as the OAM current is not a conserved quantity. Instead of utilizing the orbital conductivity associated with the non-conserved OAM current, we here use non-equilibrium Green's functions to directly image the OAM density in real space under an applied electric current bias. We find strong spatial variations in OAM density, with the lattice acting as a source and sink of OAM. Moreover, we show that the OAM response depends sensitively on the angle between the charge current and the crystal axis. This enables the generation of a transverse OAM response in one current direction and solely a longitudinal response in another. We refer to this as an orbital splitter effect, analogous to the spin splitter effect in altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>Dislocation correlations in GaN epitaxial films revealed by EBSD and XRD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir M. Kaganer, Domenik Spallek, Philipp John, Oliver Brandt, Jonas Lähnemann</p>
            <p>Correlations between dislocations in crystals reduce the elastic energy via screening of the strain by the surrounding dislocations. We study the correlations of threading dislocations in GaN epitaxial films with dislocation densities of $5\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.8\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in reciprocal space and by high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) in real space, where the strain is derived from a cross-correlation analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. The measured XRD curves and HR-EBSD strain and rotation maps are compared with Monte Carlo simulations within one and the same model for the dislocation distributions. The screening of the dislocation strains is modeled by creating pairs of dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors, with the mean distance between dislocations in a pair equal to the screening distance. The pairs overlap and cannot be distinguished as separate dipoles. The HR-EBSD-measured autocorrelation functions of the strain and rotation components follow the expected logarithmic law for distances smaller than the screening distances and become zero for larger distances, which is confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations. The kink in the plot of the autocorrelation function allows a robust and accurate determination of the screening distance without making any simulation or fit. Screening distances of 2 $\mu$m and 0.3 $\mu$m are obtained for the samples with low and high dislocation densities, respectively. The dislocation strain is thus screened by only 4 neighboring dislocations. In addition, an anisotropic resolution of the HR-EBSD measurements is observed and quantified.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Gnoli, Elisabetta Venuti, Matteo Masino, Patrizio Graziosi</p>
            <p>We have performed a comprehensive computational study of the vibrational properties and electron-phonon couplings in the three known polymorphs of pentacene. Vibrational patterns and electron-phonon interactions were calculated at several q-points of the Brillouin zone, allowing for a detailed mapping of the phonon landscape and the associated coupling mechanisms relevant to charge transport. Using a pool of post-processing tools, we analyze the different phonon dispersions. Thus, we shed light on how low-frequency phonons modulate the transport differently in the polymorphs via their distinct electron-phonon coupling (EPC) signatures in reciprocal space. In fact, we show that distinct phonons dominate in high-temperature and thin-film polymorphs with respect to the high mobility low-temperature polymorph, and that these lead to different decoherence/localization trends. We describe the microscopic origin of the mobility in bulk polymorph, demonstrating that polymorphism not only modulates the transfer integral but also the phonon pattern. For the first time we show that different EPC patterns lead to very different mobility values even in similar structures. Also, we explain how phonon confinement is responsible for the increased mobility observed in 2D phase. Finally, we address the problem of possible coexistence of multiple polymorphs within a single specimen, frequently encountered in organic crystals due to their subtle energy landscape and processing conditions. In this context, we consider the implications of polymorph intergrowth, structural defects and disorder.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Active wetting transitions induced by rotational noise at solid interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suchismita Das, Raghunath Chelakkot</p>
            <p>We investigate the wetting transitions displayed by the collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) confined within rigid, impenetrable, flat walls. In our computational study using Brownian dynamics simulations, the wall-particle interactions are implemented with a short-range repulsive potential. An enhanced rotational diffusion at the walls is used as a control parameter for wetting transitions. Increasing the wall rotational diffusion destabilizes complete wetting, and the aggregate shows morphological transitions. We observe a sequence of morphological transitions with an increase in wall rotational diffusion: symmetric complete wetting (SCW), asymmetric complete wetting (ACW), partial wetting (PW) with droplet formation, and drying. In the PW state, we compute the contact angle as a function of activity and rotational noise. Our analysis indicates that these transitions are linked to enhanced kinetic energy fluctuations of particles and bubble formations in the dense state. We further characterize the nature of these transitions by systematically analyzing an order parameter. Our work shows that modifying local reorientation rates alone is sufficient to induce wetting transitions in active systems.</p>

            <p>Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials for the next generation of optoelectronic applications, with BaZrS$_\text{3}$ attracting significant attention due to its wide bandgap, earth-abundant composition, and thermal and chemical stability. However, previous studies have consistently reported weak and ambiguous photoluminescence (PL), regardless of synthesis method, raising questions about the intrinsic optoelectronic quality of this compound. In this work, we demonstrate strong, band-to-band-dominated PL at room temperature in high-quality BaZrS$_\text{3}$ single crystals, with a PL quantum yield of $\sim$0.005\%. Despite the narrow, single-component PL emission band, time-resolved PL measurements reveal a carrier lifetime of $1.0\pm0.2$ ns. To understand the origin of the strong PL and short carrier lifetime, we perform multiwavelength excitation and polarization-dependent Raman measurements, supported by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. We identify all 23 theoretically predicted Raman-active modes and their symmetries, providing a comprehensive reference for future studies. Our results indicate that phonon-assisted carrier decay and nontrivial electron-phonon interactions contribute to the short carrier lifetimes, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further studies on compositional variations or partial cation/anion substitutions could mitigate electron-phonon coupling and enhance carrier lifetimes. By establishing a detailed reference for the intrinsic vibrational and optoelectronic properties of BaZrS$_\text{3}$, this work paves the way for further advancements in chalcogenide perovskites for energy and optoelectronic technologies.</p>

            <h2>High-performance Andreev interferometer-based electronic coolers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Cioni, Fabio Taddei</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose an electronic refrigerator based on a ballistic Andreev interferometer that allows to reach a maximum cooling power per channel up to five orders of magnitude larger than that of the conventional normal metal-insulator-superconductor cooler. This effect is achieved by exploiting the destructive interference that occurs when the superconducting phase difference equals $\pi$. This results in a strongly suppressed charge current below the superconducting gap, while still allowing the extraction of excitations above the gap, leading to a cooler with enhanced performance. Interestingly, we find that such a large cooling power per channel enables the achievement of an electronic temperature close to the theoretical lower bound. Additionally, we derive an approximate expression for this bound in the regime of low bath temperatures. Finally, we propose potential implementations of the ballistic Andreev interferometer cooler using semiconductors, graphene, and topological insulators.</p>

            <p>This paper presents progress towards the large-scale manufacturability of piezo- and ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films with very high Sc content. Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N layers were deposited by reactive sputtering from a 300 mm diameter Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N target on standard 200 mm Si wafers with Pt bottom- and Mo top-electrodes. The deposited films were analyzed in depth with X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Reciprocal Space Mapping (RSM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) showing well oriented c-axis growth over the full wafer with slight variation in the film thickness and Sc content over the wafer radius. An overall low density of abnormally oriented grains (AOG) was found. Further wafer mapping for piezoelectric and dielectric properties showed a piezoelectric performance increase by 40 % in comparison to Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N while only moderately increasing the permittivity and loss factor. Switching measurements revealed ferroelectric behavior of the film on all measured positions with an average remanent polarization of 88.36 uC/cm$^2$ and an average coercive field of 244 V/um. This successful demonstration opens new opportunities for MEMS applications with demands for high forces like microspeakers or quasi static micromirrors.</p>

            <p>CeO$_x$-based nanoforms are widely used in catalysis, or biomedical applications due to their redox activity and oxygen storage capacity. The key parameters determining their surface chemistry are the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio and the ability to transition between Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states. We synthesized Au@CeO$_x$ core@shell nanoparticles with different thicknesses of CeO$_x$ shells and different Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratios through a photothermal reaction driven by localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) at the Au nanoparticle surface induced by visible light. We introduce a way to further enhance the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio in the shell by exposing the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles to visible light using a green laser (532 nm, 50 mW). Our findings based on photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the Ce$^{4+}$-to-Ce$^{3+}$ transition results from LSPR-induced superheating of the Au@CeO$_x$ interface, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies and reduction of Ce$^{4+}$ ions. This process is reversible upon air exposure suggesting that the ability to transition between the Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states is retained in the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles. Our study presents the CeO$_x$-based nanoforms with a tunable cerium valence state ratio, highlighting the potential of plasmonic control in optimizing their photocatalytic and enzyme-mimetic properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Yadav, Mahran Yousef, David Wolpert</p>
            <p>All digital devices have components that implement Boolean functions, mapping that component's input to its output. However, any fixed Boolean function can be implemented by an infinite number of circuits, all of which vary in their resource costs. This has given rise to the field of circuit complexity theory, which studies the minimal resource cost to implement a given Boolean function with any circuit. Traditionally, circuit complexity theory has focused on the resource costs of a circuit's size (its number of gates) and depth (the longest path length from the circuit's input to its output). In this paper, we extend circuit complexity theory by investigating the minimal thermodynamic cost of a circuit's operation. We do this by using the mismatch cost (MMC) of a given circuit that is run multiple times in a row to calculate a lower bound on the entropy production (EP) incurred in each such run. Specifically, we discuss conditions under which MMC of a circuit is proportional to the size of a circuit, and conditions for them to diverge. We also use our results to compare the thermodynamic costs of different circuit families implementing the same family of Boolean functions. In addition we analyze how heterogeneity in the underlying physical processes implementing the gates in a circuit influences the minimal thermodynamic cost of the overall circuit. These and other results of ours lay the foundation for extending circuit complexity theory to include mismatch cost as a resource cost.</p>

            <h2>Understanding and Design of Interstitial Oxygen Conductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Meng</p>
            <p>Highly efficient oxygen active materials that react with, absorb, and transport oxygen is essential for fuel cells, electrolyzers and related applications. While vacancy mediated oxygen ion conductors have long been the focus of research, they are limited by high migration barriers at intermediate temperatures, which hinder their practical applications. In contrast, interstitial oxygen conductors exhibit significantly lower migration barriers enabling faster ionic conductivity at lower temperatures. This review systematically examines both well established and recently identified families of interstitial oxygen ion conductors, focusing on how their unique structural motifs such as corner sharing polyhedral frameworks, isolated polyhedral, and cage like architectures, facilitate low migration barriers through interstitial and interstitialcy diffusion mechanisms. A central discussion of this review focuses on the evolution of design strategies, from targeted donor doping, element screening, and physical intuition descriptor material discovery, which leverage computational tools to explore vast chemical spaces in search of new interstitial conductors. The success of these strategies demonstrates that a significant, largely unexplored space remains for discovering high performing interstitial oxygen conductors. Crucial features enabling high performance interstitial oxygen diffusion include the availability of electrons for oxygen reduction and sufficient structural flexibility with accessible volume for interstitial accommodation. This review concludes with a forward looking perspective, proposing a knowledge driven methodology that integrates current understanding with data centric approaches to identify promising interstitial oxygen conductors outside traditional search paradigms.</p>

            <p>Martensites subjected to quasistatic deformation are known to exhibit power law distributed acoustic emission in a broad range of scales, however, the origin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self-organization towards apparent criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure of intermittent fluctuations can be at least partially interpreted as an effect of inertia. We build on the insight that inertial dynamics, evidenced by acoustic emission, can become an important factor if the underlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the possibility of inertia-induced \textit{heavy-tailed} avalanche size distributions using a prototypical example of a discrete chain with bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia in fully realistic two- and three-dimensional continuum models of elastic phase transitions. In particular, we demonstrate that a three-dimensional model can produce not only qualitative but also quantitative agreement with experiment.</p>

            <p>Micropolar fluid theory, an extension of classical Newtonian fluid dynamics, incorporates angular velocities and rotational inertias and has long been a foundational framework for describing granular flows. We propose a macroscopic model of granular matter based on active micropolar fluid dynamics, which incorporates internal rotations, couple stresses, and broken parity through odd viscosity. Our framework extends traditional micropolar theory to describe chiral granular flows driven far from equilibrium, where energy is continuously injected and dissipated. In particular, we focus on steady states and explicitly neglect energy conservation, reflecting the dissipative nature of granular systems maintained in non-equilibrium by external forcing. Within this setup, we study the lift force experienced by a test bead embedded in a compressible, parity-breaking granular flow. We analyze how odd viscosity and microrotation modify the transverse forces, using both analytical results in the linearized Stokes regime and nonlinear finite element simulations. Our results demonstrate that active micropolar fluids provide a physically consistent and symmetry-informed continuum description of chiral granular matter, capable of capturing lift forces that emerge uniquely from odd transport effects.</p>

            <p>While the high-temperature spin diffusion in spin chains with random local fields has been the subject of numerous studies concerning the phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the energy diffusion in the same models has been much less explored. We demonstrate that energy diffusion is faster at weak random fields but becomes essentially equal at strong fields; hence, both diffusions determine the slowest relaxation time scale (Thouless time) in the system. Numerically reachable finite-size systems reveal the anomalously large distribution of diffusion constants with respect to actual field configurations. Despite the exponential-like dependence of diffusion on field strength, the results for sensitivity to twisted boundary conditions are incompatible with the Thouless criterion for localization and the presumed transition to MBL, at least for numerically reachable sizes. In contrast, we find indications of the scenario of subdiffusive transport, particularly in the dynamical diffusivity response.</p>

The $\beta$-stabilization caused by alloying Si, Fe, Cr, and Mo was observed, but the most stable phase appears between the $\beta$ and the $\alpha$ phases, corresponding to the martensitic $\alpha''$ phase. Next, the $\{112\}\langle11\bar1\rangle$ bcc twins are separated by a positive barrier, which further increases by alloying w.r.t. pure Ti. The $\{332\}\langle11\bar3\rangle$ twinning yields negative barriers for all species but Mo and Fe. This is because the transition state is structurally similar to the $\alpha$ phase, which is preferred over the $\beta$ phase for the majority of alloying elements. Lastly, the impact of alloying on twin boundary energies is discussed. These results may serve as design guidelines for novel Ti-based alloys with specific application areas.</p>

            <p>The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature $T_C$, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to interband scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multiband superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by interband scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying crystallographic defects in the form of stacking fault tetrahedra with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune interband coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters from two well separated gaps to one merged gap around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multiband superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.</p>

            <p>The growth of viscous two-dimensional lipid domains in contact with a viscoelastic actin network was recently shown to exhibit unusual lipid domain ripening due to the geometry and anisotropy of the actin network [Arnold & Takatori. Langmuir. 40, 26570-26578 (2024)]. In this work, we interpret previous experimental results on lipid membrane-actin composites with a theoretical model that combines the Cahn-Hilliard and Landau-de Gennes liquid crystal theory. In our model, we incorporate fiber-like characteristics of actin filaments and bundles through a nematic order parameter, and elastic anisotropy through cubic nematic gradients. Numerical simulations qualitatively agree with experimental observations, by reproducing the competition between the thermodynamic forces that coarsen lipid domains versus the elastic forces generated by the surrounding actin network that resist domain coarsening. We observe a decrease in the growth of domain sizes, finding $R(t) \sim t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha < 1/4$ for different actin network stiffnesses, in sharp contrast to the $\sim t^{1/3}$ scaling for diffusive growth of domains in the absence of the actin network. Our findings may serve as a foundation for future developments in modeling elastic ripening in complex systems.</p>

            <p>The spontaneous Hall effect (SHE), a finite voltage occurring transversal to the electrical current in zero-magnetic field, has been observed in both conventional and unconventional superconductors, appearing as a peak near the superconducting transition temperature. The origin of SHE is strongly debated, with proposed explanations ranging from intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms such as spontaneous symmetry breaking and time-reversal symmetry breaking (BTRS), Abrikosov vortex motion, or extrinsic factors like material inhomogeneities, such as non-uniform critical temperature (Tc) distributions or structural asymmetries. This work is an experimental study of the SHE in various superconducting materials. We focused on conventional, low-Tc, sharp transition Nb and unconventional, intermediate-Tc, smeared transition Fe(Se,Te). Our findings show distinct SHE peaks around the superconducting transition, with variations in height, sign and shape, indicating a possible common mechanism independent of the specific material. We propose that spatial inhomogeneities in the critical temperature, caused by local chemical composition variations, disorder, or other forms of electronic spatial inhomogeneities could explain the appearing of the SHE. This hypothesis is supported by comprehensive finite elements simulations of randomly distributed Tc by varying Tc-distribution, spatial scale of disorder and amplitude of the superconducting transition. The comparison between experimental results and simulations suggest a unified origin for the SHE in different superconductors, whereas different phenomenology can be explained in terms of amplitude of the transition temperature in respect to Tc-distribution.</p>

            <h2>Shubnikov-de Haas Oscillations in 2D $\text{PtSe}_2$: A fermiological Charge Carrier Investigation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Max Salchegger, Rajdeep Adhikari, Bogdan Faina, Alberta Bonanni</p>
            <p>High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.</p>

            <h2>Finding the right path: statistical mechanics of connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damien Barbier</p>
            <p>We define and study a statistical mechanics ensemble that characterizes connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Built around a well-known local entropy bias, it allows us to better identify hardness transitions in problems where the energy landscape is dominated by isolated solutions. We apply this new device to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its manifold of connected solutions behaves. We choose this particular problem because, while its typical solutions are isolated, it can be solved using local algorithms for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. With this new ensemble, we unveil the presence of a cluster composed of delocalized connected solutions. In particular, we demonstrate its stability until a critical threshold $\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$ (dependent on $\alpha$). This transition appears as paths of solutions shatter, a phenomenon that more conventional statistical mechanics approaches fail to grasp. Finally, we compared our predictions to simulations. For this, we used a modified Monte-Carlo algorithm, designed specifically to target these delocalized solutions. We obtained, as predicted, that the algorithm finds solutions until $\kappa\approx\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$.</p>

            <h2>Molecular dynamics simulation of the effects of neutron irradiation on Caesium Lead Bromide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongming Zhang, Samuel Murphy, Michael Aspinall</p>
            <p>With the development of fast neutron reactors and nuclear fusion reactors, it is necessary to find new radiation-hardened high-flux core neutron detectors. The use of perovskite Caesium Lead Bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) for neutron radiation detection is a new research direction. However, at high temperatures, the effects of neutron radiation, especially the Primary Knock-out Atom (PKA) and Displacement Per Atom (DPA), and the defect distribution at the molecular level have not been reported. This study investigated the effect on CsPbBr$_3$ produced by 14 MeV neutron irradiation under 100 K to 400 K. Molecular dynamics methods are used to model the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms at the molecular level of materials. This study obtained the displacement threshold energies of three atoms in CsPbBr$_3$ and obtained the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms within the material over time. Monte Carlo simulations were used to obtain PKA and DPA information in CsPbBr$_3$ under neutron irradiation. This research will help to further study the performance changes of halide perovskites under neutron irradiation to verify the possibility of using them as radiation-hardened neutron detectors.</p>

            <p>Interacting one-dimensional bosons with long range hopping decaying as a power law $r^{-\alpha}$ with distance $r$ are considered with the renormalization group and the self-consistent harmonic approximation. For $\alpha\ge 3$, the ground state is always a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, whereas for $\alpha <3$, a ground state with long range order breaking the continuous global gauge symmetry becomes possible for sufficiently weak repulsion. At positive temperature, continuous symmetry breaking becomes restricted to $\alpha<2$, and for $2<\alpha<3$, a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the Tomonaga-Luttinger exponent diverging at low temperature is found.</p>

            <h2>«Anticommuting» $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumiran Pujari, Harsh Nigam</p>
            <p>We discuss a class of lattice $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum Hamiltonians with bond-dependent Ising couplings and a mutually «anticommuting» algebra of extensively many local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ conserved charges that was explicated in [arXiv:2407.06236]. This mutual algebra is reminiscent of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Pauli matrix algebra but encoded in the structure of \emph{local conserved charges}. These models have finite residual entropy density in the ground state with a simple but non-trivial degeneracy counting and concomitant quantum spin liquidity as proved in [arXiv:2407.06236]. The spin liquidity relies on a geometrically site-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that is rather natural in presence of an «anticommuting» structure, as opposed to for example the bond-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ hexagonal plaquette charges of the Kitaev honeycomb spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model which leads to a mutually commuting local algebra. In this work, we make several exact statements on the many-body order that can be present within the class of «anticommuting» quantum spin liquids. We elucidate the differences between the many-body order in these models and that found in some gapped quantum spin liquids with mutually commuting local algebras, e.g. the Kitaev toric code or Levin-Wen models. We also point out a mutually commuting algebra with local support that are naturally expressed as multi-linear Majorana forms in the Kitaev representation of these quantum spin liquids. They capture non-trivial quantum resonances throughout the lattice in these «anticommuting» $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid Hamiltonians.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic field-free braiding and nontrivial fusion of Majorana bound states in high-temperature planar Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pankaj Sharma, Narayan Mohanta</p>
            <p>Demonstration of non-Abelian statistics of Majorana bound states (MBS) is crucial for the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Two-dimensional platforms such as planar Josephson junctions require an in-plane magnetic field to generate a pair of MBS at its non-superconducting channel ends; however, the fixed direction of the in-plane magnetic field puts a constraint on the realization of a multi-terminal topological planar junction, and hence its ability to physically move multiple MBS -- which is necessary for performing the fusion and braiding operations. Here we show that in a planar Josephson junction coupled to a skyrmion crystal, which can generate multiple pairs of MBS in the absence of any external magnetic field, the non-trivial fusion and braiding operations can be performed. Our numerical calculations, designed for realistic two-dimensional quantum systems, certify the feasibility of experimental realization of the proposed device schemes. We find that both $s$-wave and $d$-wave superconducting leads can generate the MBS; indicating that the MBS movement operations can be performed at higher temperatures using $d$-wave superconducting leads. Our results establish that the skyrmion crystal-coupled planar Josephson junction is a viable platform for the generation and controlled movement of the MBS.</p>

            <h2>Probing quantum geometry with two-dimensional nonlinear optical spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Froese, Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>Recent studies have shown that the nonlinear optical response of crystalline systems is fundamentally a quantum geometric property. In this work, we propose two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which measures the nonlinear conductivity as a function of two independent frequencies using two time-delayed light pulses, as a probe of quantum geometry. We show how the two-frequency second-order nonlinear conductivity, which is naturally measured by 2DCS, decomposes into distinct quantum geometric contributions. We identify a term arising from the multi-band quantum connection that does not appear in linear response, and show that it can be measured in isolation by considering specific polarizations and enforcing time-reversal symmetry. We explore this finding via model calculations for transition metal dichalcogenides and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Through these examples, we demonstrate how 2DCS enables study of the quantum connection, providing a way to compare the quantum geometry of different materials. We also show that one can gain rough momentum-resolved knowledge of the quantum geometry by varying the chemical potential.</p>

            <p>Complex chalcogenides in the $M$PS$_3$ family of materials ($M$ = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) display remarkably different phase progressions depending upon the metal center orbital filling, character of the P-P linkage, and size of the van der Waals gap. There is also a stacking pattern and spin state difference between the lighter and heavier transition metal-containing systems that places CoPS$_3$ at the nexus of these activities. Despite these unique properties, this compound is under-explored. Here, we bring together Raman scattering spectroscopy and infrared absorption spectroscopy with X-ray techniques to identify a structural component to the 119 K magnetic ordering transition as well as a remarkable lower temperature set of magnon-phonon pairs that engage in avoided crossings along with a magnetic scattering continuum that correlates with phonon lifetime effects. These findings point to strong spin-phonon entanglement as well as opportunities to control these effects under external stimuli.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takashi Yanagisawa</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground-state properties of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, based on the off-diagonal wave function variational Monte Carlo method. We use an optimized wave function that is improved from an initial one-body wave function by multiplying by multiple correlation operators that are given by the form of exp($-S$)-type where $S$ is a suitable operator. We examine the inhomogeneous ground state at near 1/8 doping in the strongly correlated region where the on-site Coulomb interaction is larger than the bandwidth. The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Gawarecki, Alina Garbiec, Jakub Stanecki, Michał Zieliński</p>
            <p>We present a detailed comparative study of two important theoretical approaches: atomistic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding and continuum eight-band $k \cdot p$ methods, for modeling the spin and optical properties of quantum dots (QDs). Our investigation spans key physical observables, including single-particle energy levels, g-factors, exciton radiative lifetimes, and hyperfine-induced Overhauser field fluctuations. We perform our calculations for self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs QD systems as representative case studies. While both methods yield qualitatively consistent trends, quantitative discrepancies arise due to different treatment of atomistic details, strain effects, and confinement. We introduce targeted corrections to the eight-band $k \cdot p$ framework, including a modified deformation potential scheme and adjusted remote-band contributions, to improve agreement with atomistic results, especially for electron g-factors and single-particle energies. Furthermore, we validate the eight-band implementation of hyperfine interactions by benchmarking it against the tight-binding model, showing reasonable convergence for both electrons and holes. Our results establish criteria for selecting the appropriate modeling framework based on the desired physical accuracy and computational efficiency in spin-optical studies of semiconductor QDs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Gao, Yixuan Huang, Sadamichi Maekawa, Wei Li</p>
            <p>Using the developed thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling behaviors of the normalized spin current across the interface. Using the 1D Heisenberg chain as a benchmark system, we observe a negative spinon spin current exhibiting algebraic scaling $T^{\alpha}$, with exponent $\alpha$, in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with distinct spin-current signatures - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence - distinguishing different spin states. Remarkably, we discover a persistent, negative spin current in the spin supersolid phase. It saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit, and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits provide sensitive probes for spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Furthermore, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.</p>

The areal N atom density is one third of the areal C atom density in practical devices. It is found that the nitrided layer screens the unfavorable Coulomb interaction of O atoms in the SiO$_2$. However, the electrons flowing under the nitrided layer are significantly scattered by the fluctuation of potential due to the low areal N atom density. These results imply that the areal N atom density should be increased so that the fluctuation of potential is suppressed.</p>

            <p>The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians we obtain analytic \textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. This validation not only furnishes a tractable, physics-inspired lens for interpretability but also provides the groundwork for novel generative models, bridging the gap between theoretical condensed matter physics and AI.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate magnetic anisotropy in materials with non-critical elements to determine which symmetry conditions and atomic shell filling favor enhanced magnetic anisotropy. We study the magnetocrystalline anisotropies (MCA) of the equiatomic ferrous compounds FeCo and FeNi using ab initio calculations and analytical approaches via the diatomic pair model. We find that when these materials undergo a Bain transformation, that is, the variation of the a and c lattice parameters adjust to interpolate between the B2 and L10 structural phases while keeping the unit cell volume constant, the MCA versus r = c/a ratio varies differently for FeCo and FeNi despite Co and Ni differing only by one valence electron. To uncover the physics governing these trends, we use a diatomic pair model to perform a theoretical analysis of the ab initio results. We find that the MCA variation along the Bain path is correlated with the structural phase of the material as well as the occupation of (l, m)-resolved states for each equiatomic ferrous compound. Accordingly, the MCA was found to differ depending on the element paired with Fe to form the Fe-X compound (X = Co, Ni). Our work could help guide the scientific community in solving the supply crisis of hard/strong permanent magnets that are crucial for various technological applications such as those depending on motors and generators for energy conversion and clean energy applications.</p>

            <p>Tetramethylammonium (TMA) cadmium azide, is a new perovskite-like compound which undergoes a series of first-order phase transitions, including a ferroelastic transition above room temperature. Understanding the order-disorder structural phase transition (SPT) mechanism in hybrid organic--inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) is crucial for designing new compounds with enhanced barocaloric efficiency, as well as unlocking other multifunctional properties. In this paper, we employed the energy fluctuation (EF) model to investigate the experimental linewidth of Raman modes in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ near the critical phase transition temperature ($T_C = {322}{K}$), aiming to gain insights into the molecular dynamics around the SPT. The temperature dependence of the strain, used as an order parameter, was obtained using the appropriate thermodynamic potential for the first-order phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, expressed through a Landau expansion, which can be successfully employed to model first-order ferroelastic phase transitions. We show that the EF model suitably captures the behavior of the Raman linewidths in the vicinity of the structural phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The activation energies obtained for TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ are comparable to those of DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, as well as to $k_B T_C$. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the relaxation reveals that the torsional and librational modes require longer to renormalize after the phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ when compared with DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The discussion based on these new parameters provides a new perspective for understanding molecular dynamics in systems undergoing order-disorder phase transitions, particularly in ferroelastic transitions, where order-disorder mechanisms are coupled to symmetry-breaking lattice distortions.</p>

            <p>Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.</p>

A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce Néel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.</p>

            <p>We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jalil Varela-Manjarres, Yafei Ren, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by fsLP are coupled self-consistently to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. This theory explains how fsLP, of central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a {\em nonequilibrium spintronic mechanism}. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) decodes frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by {\em nonlocal} damping with the LLG equation due to, explicitly included via TDNEGF, electronic bath. The TDNEGF part of the loop is also used to include excitons via mean-field treatment, utilizing off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, of Coulomb interaction binding conduction-band electrons and valence-band holes. Finally, our theory predicts how excited magnons will {\em pump} time-dependent charge currents into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor that will then emit electromagnetic radiation. The windowed FFT of these signals contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</p>

            <h2>Tailoring the Electronic Properties of Monoclinic (InxAl1-x)2O3 Alloys via Substitutional Donors and Acceptors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Abdelilah Fadla, Myrta Grüning, Lorenzo Stella</p>
            <p>Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors such as \b{eta}-Ga2O3 are ideal materials for next-generation power electronic devices. Electronic and mechanical properties of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 can be tuned by alloying with other sesquioxides, notably Al2O3 and In2O3. Moreover, by tuning the In content of a (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloy, its lattice constants can be matched to those of Ga2O3, while preserving a large conduction-band offset. In view of potential applications to \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuad M. Saradzhev</p>
            <p>The generalized Levy-Leblond equation (GLL) is used to study the bound state problem for a non-relativistic Fermi field in external potentials. A condition when the rest energy term can be removed from the GLL equation is determined. For external potentials which do not obey the condition, the bound state spectrum is affected non-trivially by the rest energy of the Fermi field. This is demonstrated for a spherical finite-depth well potential. The existence, number, and energies of bound states depend on the value of the rest energy.</p>

            <h2>Hyperfine Structure of Quantum Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang-Hong Mo, Yao Zhou, Jia-Rui Sun, Peng Ye</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent advantages and limitations. In this work, we introduce the hyperfine structure of entanglement, which decomposes entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases, especially topological gapped state and trivial gapped state. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Manshouri, Moslem Zarei, Mehdi Abdi, Sougato Bose, Abolfazl Bayat</p>
            <p>We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from quantum-enhanced scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations. We show that a simple particle configuration measurement together with a maximum likelihood estimation can closely reach the ultimate precision limit in both single- and multi-particle probes.</p>

            <h2>Coherent information for CSS codes under decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Niwa, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>Stabilizer codes lie at the heart of modern quantum-error-correcting codes (QECC). Of particular importance is a class called Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which includes many important examples such as toric codes, color codes, and fractons. Recent studies have revealed that the decoding transition for these QECCs could be intrinsically captured by calculating information-theoretic quantities from the mixed state. Here we perform a simple analytic calculation of the coherent information for general CSS codes under local incoherent Pauli errors via diagonalization of the density matrices and mapping to classical statistical mechanical (SM) models. Our result establishes a rigorous connection between the decoding transition of the quantum code and the phase transition in the random classical SM model. It is also directly confirmed for CSS codes that exact error correction is possible if and only if the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder always succeeds in the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the fundamental threshold is saturated by the optimal decoder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Ermakov, Oleg Lychkovskiy, Boris V. Fine</p>
            <p>We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</p>

            <p>Disorder-induced phenomena in quantum many-body systems pose significant challenges for analytical methods and numerical simulations at relevant time and system scales. To reduce the cost of disorder-sampling, we investigate quantum circuits initialized in states tunable to superpositions over all disorder configurations. In a translationally-invariant lattice gauge theory (LGT), these states can be interpreted as a superposition over gauge sectors. We observe localization in this LGT in the absence of disorder in one and two dimensions: perturbations fail to diffuse despite fully disorder-free evolution and initial states. However, Rényi entropy measurements reveal that superposition-prepared states fundamentally differ from those obtained by direct disorder sampling. Leveraging superposition, we propose an algorithm with a polynomial speedup in sampling disorder configurations, a longstanding challenge in many-body localization studies.</p>

            <p>Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity fields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological bands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liyuan Chen, Yuanjie Ren, Ruihua Fan, Arthur Jaffe</p>
            <p>One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</p>

We also show that this analytical solution admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution as long as the parameters are physically feasible. Furthermore, a clear correspondence between our solution and the BKW solution pertaining to nonrelativistic Maxwell molecules is established, thereby clarifying the non-existence of a BKW-type solution in the relativistic domain for massive particles.</p>

            <p>Numerous networked systems feature a structure of nontrivial communities, which often correspond to their functional modules. Such communities have been detected in real-world biological, social and technological systems, as well as in synthetic models thereof. While much effort has been devoted to developing methods for community detection in traditional networks, the study of community structure in networks with higher-order interactions is still not as extensively explored. In this article, we introduce a formalism for the hypermodularity of higher-order networks that allows us to use spectral methods to detect community structures in hypergraphs. We apply this approach to synthetic random networks as well as to real-world data, showing that it produces results that reflect the nature and the dynamics of the interactions modelled, thereby constituting a valuable tool for the extraction of hidden information from complex higher-order data sets.</p>

However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges.

We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</p>

Further, we develop AFMBench a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging AI agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state of the art models struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, Claude 3.5 sonnet performs unexpectedly poorly despite excelling in materials domain question answering (QA) benchmarks, revealing that domain specific QA proficiency does not necessarily translate to effective agentic capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLMs can deviate from instructions, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi agent frameworks outperform single-agent architectures. We also observe significant prompt fragility, where slight modifications in prompt structure cause substantial performance variations in capable models like GPT 4o. Finally, we evaluate AILA's effectiveness in increasingly advanced experiments AFM calibration, feature detection, mechanical property measurement, graphene layer counting, and indenter detection.

Using this formalism, we derive the thermodynamics and phase structure of ferromagnets with atoms in the doubly symmetric or doubly antisymmetric irreducible representations. The symmetric representation leads to a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase with transitions similar to the ones for the fundamental representation studied before. The antisymmetric representation presents qualitatively new features, leading to a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist over a range of temperatures, two of them becoming metastable.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Medina-Guerra, I. V. Gornyi, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</p>

            <p>In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</p>

            <p>$\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500°C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $k=6\sim13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.</p>

            <p>Scrambling quantum systems have attracted attention as effective substrates for temporal information processing. Here we consider a quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove that memory decays exponentially in time for local noisy channels. These results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum models.</p>

Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</p>

            <p>Many quantum technologies require a precise electrical current standard that can only be achieved with expensive cryogenics, or through the secondary standards, such as resistance or voltage. Silicon-based charge pumps could provide such a standard in an inherently scalable way, through their compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication methods. However, coherent quantized charge transfer has so far been demonstrated only in nanoscale devices that are custom-fabricated in academic cleanrooms or research technology foundries. Here, we show that a CMOS device manufactured with commercial 22-nm process node can be used to define a quantum current standard in the International System of Units (SI). We measure an accuracy of (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-3 A/A at 50 MHz with reference to SI voltage and resistance standards in a pumped helium system. We then propose a practical monolithic CMOS chip that incorporates one million parallel connected charge pumps along with on-chip control electronics. This chip could be operated as a table-top primary standard that can be easily integrated with CMOS electronics, generating quantum currents of up to microampere levels.</p>

            <h2>Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez, Jiuci Xu</p>
            <p>We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez</p>
            <p>Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <h2>Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Falasca</p>
            <p>This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.</p>

            <h2>Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates with Less Overhead</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seigo Kikura, Kazufumi Tanji, Akihisa Goban, Shinichi Sunami</p>
            <p>High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.</p>

            <p>Thermal and photothermal effects play an increasing role at the nanoscale due to the general decrease of thermal conductances and to the increasing role of interfaces. Here we present a non-contact optomechanical analysis of the thermal and photothermal properties of suspended nanowires based on pump-probe response measurements: a probe laser measures the nanowire deformations and property changes caused by an intensity-modulated pump laser launching thermal waves propagating along the 1D conductor. The analysis of the dominant photothermal contributions to the nanowires response in the spectral and spatial domains allows in particular to quantify the interfacial contact resistance, to detect its internal optical resonances and to image absorption inhomogeneities. Additionally, by exploiting the temperature-induced optical reflectivity changes of the nanowire, we directly image the spatial structure of the thermal waves propagating within the nanowire. Finally we investigate how those thermal waves are responsible for a dynamical modulation of the nanowire vibration frequency, in the resolved sideband regime, providing novel analytical tools to further inspect the structural properties of nano-optomechanical systems with a large signal to noise ratio. Those methods are generic and critical to correctly understand the photothermal dynamical back action processes and improve the intrinsic sensitivity of those ultrasensitive force probes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Schäfer, Claudio Chamon, Chris R. Laumann</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code -- the quintessential model of topological order -- hosts additional, emergent topological phases when perturbed: descendant fractional quantum Hall-like states, which we term \textit{Hall-on-Toric}. These hierarchical states feature fractionalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$ charges and increased topological ground-state degeneracy. The Hall-on-Toric phases appear in the vicinity of the transitions between deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_p$ phases with different background charge per unit cell, in a fixed non-trivial flux background. We confirm their existence through extensive infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations, analyzing the topological entanglement entropy, entanglement spectra, and a generalized Hall conductance. Remarkably, the Hall-on-Toric states remain robust even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry. Our findings reinforce the foundational interpretation of star and plaquette defects as magnetic and electric excitations, and reveal that this perspective extends to a much deeper level.</p>

            <p>We revisit the electronic structure and band topology of monolayer 1H-NbSe$_2$, which hosts both superconductivity and charge density wave, and its related compounds 1H-MoS$_2$, NbS$_2$, TaS$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$. We construct a 6-band, a 3-band, and - simplest of all - a single-band model for this material family, by directly Wannierizing the ab initio bands. All host obstructed atomic isolated bands away from the atomic positions near the Fermi energy. We find that in the 3-band model, the obstructed atomic Wannier function can be well approximated by an optimally compact Wannier function with more than 90% accuracy for all the compounds, rising to a remarkable 94% accuracy in NbSe$_2$. Interestingly, the simplest single-band model has next nearest-neighboring hopping larger than the nearest-neighboring hopping (by nearly an order of magnitude for MoS$_2$, NbSe$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$), which comes from the cancellation between the atomic onsite terms and the atomic nearest-neighboring hopping after projecting to the obstructed atomic Wannier functions. Furthermore for NbSe$_2$, we employ a novel approximation scheme to obtain an effective Hamiltonian that captures the 3 bands originating mainly from the Nb atom. We also use conventional perturbation theory to derive the ab initio obstructed Wannier function with 95% accuracy. Our results pave the way for future study of the effect of quantum geometry on the correlated phases in this family of materials.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Hall Andreev Conversion in Graphene Nanostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexey Bondarev, William H. Klein, Harold U. Baranger</p>
            <p>We study Andreev conversion in clean nanostructures containing an interface between graphene in the quantum Hall (QH) state and a superconductor, focusing on the lowest Landau level. First, several graphene nanostructures formed from zigzag edges with sharp corners are considered using a tight-binding model. We find the scattering state for an electron impinging on the interface from the upstream QH edge state, together with the probability of it exiting as a hole in the downstream QH edge state (Andreev conversion). From these results, we deduce the behavior for edges at an arbitrary angle and for rounded corners. A key issue is whether the graphene-superconductor interface is fully transparent or only partially transparent. For full transparency, we recover previous results. In contrast, interfaces with partial but substantial transparency (well away from the tunneling limit) behave very differently: (i) the hybrid electron-hole interfacial modes are not valley degenerate and (ii) intervalley scattering can occur at the corners, even when rounded. As a result, interference between the two hybrid modes can occur, even in the absence of disorder. Finally, we compare the sensitivity of Andreev conversion to interface transparency in the QH regime to that in the absence of a magnetic field. While the zero-field result closely follows the classic Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk relation, Andreev conversion in the QH regime is considerably more robust.</p>

            <p>Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz-2DCS) is transforming our ability to probe, visualize, and control quantum materials far from equilibrium. This emerging technique brings multi-dimensional resolution to the ultrafast dynamics of nonequilibrium phases of matter, enabling new capabilities demanding precise coherent control and measurement of many-body dynamics and multi-order correlations. By mapping complex excitations across time and frequency dimensions, THz-2DCS delivers coherence tomography of driven quantum matter, thus revealing hidden excitation pathways, measuring higher order nonlinear response functions, disentangling various quantum pathways, capturing collective modes on ultrafast timescales and at terahertz frequencies. These experimental features frequently remain obscured in traditional single particle measurements, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, and equilibrium-based probes. This Review traces the early development of THz-2DCS and showcases significant recent progress in leveraging this technique to probe and manipulate quantum material properties, including nonequilibrium superconductivity, nonlinear magnonics, dynamical topological phases, and the detection of novel excitations and exotic collective modes with potential technological impact. Looking forward, we identify critical opportunities in advancing THz-2DCS instrumentation and experimental strategies that are shaping future applications in THz optoelectronics, quantum information processing, and sensing.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.</p>

Enhanced sensitivity enables detection of single weakly coupled 13C nuclear spins and external 11B spins from a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layer, achieving nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance. A protective h-BN top layer stabilizes the platform, ensuring robustness against harsh treatments and compatibility with target materials.

We construct a Ginzburg--Landau theory for the three superconducting order parameters, which correspond to the three irreducible representations of the point group $C_{3v}$. The irreducible representations $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the most likely. We develop a systematic method to determine the symmetry-allowed terms and apply it to derive all terms up to fourth order in the three order parameters. The Ginzburg--Landau functional also includes coupling to the magnetic field. The functional is employed to determine the effect of an applied uniform magnetic field on the nodal structure for $A_1$ and $A_2$ pairing. The results facilitate clear-cut experimental differentiation between these symmetries. We also predict field-induced pair-density waves.</p>

The spectral composition of the effect exhibits a strong low-pass behavior, decreasing by approximately 75% from 0 THz to 0.2 THz and vanishing entirely at 1.5 THz. Using a dynamic magnetoresistive model, we can fully explain the spectral dependence by competition of transverse spin-torque (coherent) and longitudinal (incoherent) contributions to the spin current and their characteristic response times. Our analysis suggests that the slow dissipation of incoherent magnons from the interface is the limiting process responsible for the dramatic spectral decay of the SMR. These results establish THz SMR as a powerful probe of ultrafast interfacial spin-magnon coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens H. Nyhegn, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen, Leon Balents, Georg M. Bruun</p>
            <p>The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.</p>

A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce Néel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.</p>

            <p>Crystalline topological insulator nanowires with a magnetic flux threaded through their cross section display Aharanov-Bohm conductance oscillations. A characteristic of these oscillations is the perfectly transmitted mode present at certain values of the magnetic flux, due to the appearance of an effective time-reversal symmetry combined with the topological origin of the nanowire surface states. In contrast, amorphous nanowires display a varying cross section along the wire axis that breaks the effective time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we use transport calculations to study the stability of the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and the perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological nanowires. We observe that at low energies and up to moderate amorphicity the transport is dominated, as in the crystalline case, by the presence of a perfectly transmitted mode. In an amorphous nanowire the perfectly transmitted mode is protected by chiral symmetry or, in its absence, by a statistical time-reversal symmetry. At high amorphicities the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations disappear and the conductance is dominated by nonquantized resonant peaks. We identify these resonances as bound states and relate their appearance to a topological phase transition that brings the nanowires into a trivial insulating phase.</p>

When weak spin anisotropy is considered, the competing interactions are affected, and the field-induced fluctuations can lead to a well-defined magnetization plateau within a field range, in which an exotic quantum state can emerge. This state exhibits the coexistence of ferromagnetic and dimerized chains driven by the relation between frustration and the external field. Moreover, we identify a phase transition from a collinear antiferromagnetic order to a disordered state at a finite temperature. Our findings reveal unconventional magnetic properties at low temperatures that can guide future experimental studies of verdazyl-based compounds with anisotropic exchange interactions.</p>

            <h2>Radical scaling: beyond our feet and fingers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc-Antoine Fardin, Mathieu Hautefeuille, Vivek Sharma</p>
            <p>Scaling laws arise and are eulogized across disciplines from natural to social sciences for providing pithy, quantitative, `scale-free', and `universal' power law relationships between two variables. On a log-log plot, the power laws display as straight lines, with a slope set by the exponent of the scaling law. In practice, a scaling relationship works only for a limited range, bookended by crossovers to other scaling laws. Leading with Taylor's oft-cited scaling law for the blast radius of an explosion against time, and by collating an unprecedented amount of datasets for laser-induced, chemical and nuclear explosions, we show distinct kinematics arise at the early and late stages. We illustrate that picking objective scales for the two axes using the transitions between regimes leads to the collapse of the data for the two regimes and their crossover, but the third regime is typically not mapped to the master curve. The objective scales permit us to abandon the arbitrarily chosen anthropocentric units of measurement, like feet for length and heart-beat for time, but the decimal system with ten digits (fingers) is still part of the picture. We show a remarkable collapse of all three regimes onto a common master curve occurs if we replace the base 10 by a dimensionless radix that combines the scales from the two crossovers. We also illustrate this approach of radical scaling for capillarity-driven pinching, coalescence and spreading of drops and bubbles, expecting such generalizations will be made for datasets across many disciplines.</p>

            <h2>Optimal boron-doped graphene substrate for glucose Raman signal enhancement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Komeda, Antonio Cammarata, Tomas Polcar</p>
            <p>Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is a highly sensitive and selective technique that greatly enhances the signal of an analyte, compared with its signal from classical Raman Spectroscopy, due to its interaction with a substrates surface. It has been shown that low concentration boron-doped graphene (B-graphene) enhances the Raman signal of simple organic molecules like pyridine. Recent studies also suggest that B-graphene can remain thermodynamically stable when doped with significantly higher concentrations of boron than previously observed. In this framework, we use quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the influence of dopant concentration and geometric distribution on the effectiveness of B-doped graphene as a SERS substrate, with glucose as analyte. By combining analysis of interatomic force constants and of phonon eigenvectors composition, we conclude that higher doping concentrations provide a larger enhancement to glucose's Raman signal, while the molecule orientation relative to the surface plays a fundamental role in the Raman response. We suggest that high concentration B-graphene presents itself as a potential substrate for SERS based detection of glucose, while the used phonon-based analysis can be promptly applied for the search of promising candidates as substrate materials for enhanced Raman response.</p>

In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jalil Varela-Manjarres, Yafei Ren, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons within two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by classical vector potential of fsLP are coupled to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory explains how fsLP, with central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a genuine nonequilibrium spintronic effect. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) reveals frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by nonlocal damping due to the bath of electrons. In addition, the TDNEGF part of our TDNEGF+LLG self-consistent loop computes a time-dependent density matrix whose off-diagonal elements are utilized to describe, at the mean-field level, inter-orbital Coulomb interaction binding electrons and holes into excitons. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory predicts how excited magnons {\em pump} charge current into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor responsible for microwave emission. The windowed FFT of the former signal contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yitong Yao, Jun Li, Jiacheng Ye, Fan Yang, Dao-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>We investigate the energy bands, magnetism, and superconductivity of bilayer octagraphene with A-A stacking under a perpendicular electric field. A tight-binding model is used to analyze the band structure of the system. The doubling of the unit cell results in each band of the single layer splitting into two. We find that applying a perpendicular electric field increases the band splitting. As the electric field strength increases, the nesting of the Fermi Surface(FS) weakens, eventually disrupting the antiferromagnetic order and bilayer octagraphene exhibits superconductivity. Spin fluctuations can induce unconventional superconductivity with s+--wave pairing. Applying a perpendicular electric field to bilayer octagraphene parent weakens the nesting of the FS, ultimately killing the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordered state and transitioning it into the superconducting state, whichworks as a doping effect. We use the random-phase approximation approach to obtain the pairing eigenvalues and pairing symmetries of the perpendicular electric field-tuned bilayer octagraphene in the weak coupling limit. By tuning the strength of the perpendicular electric field, the critical interaction strength for SDW order can be modified, which in turn may promote the emergence of unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Geometric orthogonal metals: Hidden antiferromagnetism and pseudogap from fluctuating stripes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henning Schlömer, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended pseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have been proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders such as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) and orthogonal metal (OM) phases. The topological nature of FL* and OM phases has been identified as scenarios compatible with a small Fermi surface without symmetry breaking, as suggested experimentally. With recent experimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between stripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative scenario: an orthogonal metal with a geometric origin (GOM) driven by fluctuating domain walls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the proliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real-space, but order is preserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result, well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist, which couple to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological excitations of the domain wall string-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface. At a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a transition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point (hQCP) featuring quantum critical transport properties. Our GOM framework establishes a deep connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases, and suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron and hole) doped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.</p>

We neglect spin and fix a density of one third, with one unit of magnetic flux per particle. The infinite density matrix renormalization group algorithm is used to compute the ground state of this generalized Fermi-Hubbard model. Increasing the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion, we find a first order transition between an Integer Quantum Hall phase and a crystalline, generalized Wigner crystal state. The first-order nature of the phase transition is consistent with a Ginzburg-Landau argument. We expect our results to be relevant for moiré heterostructures of two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Fan Qu, Martino Stefanini, Tao Shi, Tilman Esslinger, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Jamir Marino, Eugene Demler</p>
            <p>Recent experiments with quantum simulators using ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits have demonstrated the potential of controlled dissipation as a versatile tool for realizing correlated many-body states. However, determining the dynamics of dissipative quantum many-body systems remains a significant analytical and numerical challenge. In this work, we focus on a dissipative impurity problem as a testbed for new methodological developments. We introduce an efficient non-perturbative framework that combines the superposition of Gaussian states (SGS) variational ansatz with the quantum trajectory approach to simulate open systems featuring a dissipative impurity. Applying this method to a spinful impurity subject to two-body losses and embedded in a bath of noninteracting fermions, we explore the full crossover from weak to strong dissipation regimes. The non-perturbative nature of the SGS ansatz allows us to thoroughly examine this crossover, providing comprehensive insights into the system's behavior. In the strong dissipation regime, our approach reproduces the finding that localized two-body losses can induce the Kondo effect [arXiv:2406.03527], characterized by a slowdown of spin relaxation and an enhancement of charge conductance. Furthermore, we reveal an exotic ``negative conductance" phenomenon at zero potential bias -- a counter-intuitive single-body effect resulting from intermediate dissipation and finite bandwidth. Finally, we investigate the formation of ferromagnetic domains and propose an extension to realize a higher-spin Kondo model using localized dissipation.</p>

            <p>Using high-energy-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering, we observe anomalous softening and damping of the transverse acoustic phonon in UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as the system is cooled towards the charge density wave (CDW) transition temperature, T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The phonon exhibits a marked Kohn-type anomaly around the CDW wave vector, Q$_{\rm{CDW}}$, and becomes overdamped within a finite momentum range already well above T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The dispersion anomaly is consistent with potential Fermi surface nesting, which together with the extended phonon collapse indicate strong electron-phonon coupling. The transition temperature estimated from the phonon softening is markedly lower than T$_{\rm{CDW}}$, consistent with a primarily electronic instability rather than a phonon-driven transition. Our results establish UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as a prime example of a strongly correlated electron CDW system with exceptionally strong electron-phonon coupling driving phonon softening and collapse.</p>

            <p>The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</p>

            <p>The segregation of solutes to grain boundaries can significantly influence material behavior. Most previous computational studies have concentrated on substitutional solute segregation, neglecting interstitial segregation due to its increased complexity. The site preference, interstitial or substitutional, for P segregation in $\alpha$-Fe still remains under debate. In this work, we investigate the full GB-segregation spectrum for both substitutional and interstitial GB sites in a polycrystalline atomistic structure of ferrite with the aid of classical interatomic potentials combined with machine learning techniques. The method is qualitatively tested for H and Ni, where the segregation behavior in $\alpha$-Fe is well understood. Our findings for P show that segregation to both types of GB sites is possible, with a preference for the substitutional sites based on the mean segregation energy. However, due to the much larger number of interstitial sites, interstitial segregation significantly contributes to the GB enrichment with P. This underscores the importance of considering interstitial P segregation in addition to the substitutional one. Furthermore, we also argue that equally important for quantitative predictions (that agree with experimental data) is to get a representative spectrum of the segregation energies.</p>

            <p>The tunable band structure and nontrivial topology of multilayer rhombohedral graphene lead to a variety of correlated electronic states with isospin orders-meaning ordered states in the combined spin and valley degrees of freedom-dictated by the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and Hunds exchange interactions. However, methods for mapping local isospin textures and determining the exchange energies are currently lacking. Here, we image the magnetization textures in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene using a nanoscale superconducting quantum interference device. We observe sharp magnetic phase transitions that indicate spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. In the quarter-metal phase, the spin and orbital moments align closely, providing a bound on the spin-orbit coupling energy. We also show that the half-metal phase has a very small magnetic anisotropy, which provides an experimental lower bound on the intervalley Hunds exchange interaction energy. This is found to be close to its theoretical upper bound. The ability to resolve the local isospin texture and the different interaction energies will allow a better understanding of the phase transition hierarchy and the numerous correlated electronic states arising from spontaneous and induced isospin symmetry breaking in graphene heterostructures.</p>

For high entry and exit rates of the cellular automaton, and with {sufficiently large} particle numbers, the DWs formed are independent of the associated rate parameters, revealing a {\em hitherto unknown universality} in their {\em shapes}. In contrast, the DWs do depend upon these parameters, if they are small, and hence have nonuniversal shapes. Our predictions on the DWs are testable in experiments.</p>

            <p>The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.</p>

We show theoretically that these interactions, often attributed to contact friction, are a direct consequence of fluid flows between rough particles in relative motion. We find that small surface asperities generically lead to localized hydrodynamic sliding forces and torques that can exceed their smooth counterparts by orders of magnitude. A fully analytic thin-film theory shows that these forces grow inversely with the surface separation, significantly more singular than the logarithmic scaling for smooth particles. The impending singularity tightly constrains the particles' rotation with their translation, recovering a crucial ingredient in dense suspension rheology. Despite their purely hydrodynamic origin, these features resemble several aspects of dry rolling and sliding friction.</p>

We investigate detection prospects of pg-, ng-, and $\mu$g-scale detectors by calculating the scattering rate between dark matter and free electrons confined in two-dimensional graphene, including Pauli-blocking factors and in-medium screening effects. We find that the proposed detector is expected to not only serve as a complementary probe of super-light dark matter but also achieve higher experimental sensitivities than other proposed experiments, assuming zero readout noise, thanks to the extremely low threshold energy of our graphene Josephson junction sensor.</p>

            <p>We use the computer algebra system GAP to classify modular data up to rank 12. This extends the previously obtained classification of modular data up to rank 6. Our classification includes all the modular data from modular tensor categories up to rank 12, with a few possible exceptions at rank 12 and levels $5,7$ and $14$. Those exceptions are eliminated up to a certain bound by an extensive finite search in place of required infinite search. Our list contains a few potential unitary modular data which are not known to correspond to any unitary modular tensor categories (such as those from Kac-Moody algebra, twisted quantum doubles of finite group, as well as their Abelian anyon condensations). It remains to be shown if those potential modular data can be realized by modular tensor categories or not. We provide some evidence that all may be constructed from centers of near-group categories or gauging group symmetries of known modular tensor categories, with the exception of a total of five cases at rank 11 (with $D^2 =1964.590$) and 12 (with $D^2 =3926.660$). The classification of modular data corresponds to a classification of modular tensor categories (up to modular isotopes which are not expected to be present at low ranks). The classification of modular tensor categories leads to a classification of gapped quantum phases of matter in 2-dimensional space for bosonic lattice systems with no symmetry, as well as a classification of generalized symmetries in 1-dimensional space.</p>

            <p>We give a complete classification of the anyon sectors of Kitaev's quantum double model on the infinite triangular lattice and for finite gauge group $G$, including the non-abelian case. As conjectured, the anyon sectors of the model correspond precisely to equivalence classes of irreducible representations of the quantum double algebra of $G$.</p>

            <p>Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian Delocalization Induced by Residue Imaginary Velocity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Xin Hu, Yong-Xu Fu, Yi Zhang</p>
            <p>The dichotomy of localization versus delocalization is a historic topic central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. In sharp contrast to conventional formalisms through extended wavefunctions, these target systems exhibit delocalization in collective physical properties such as correlation and entanglement (of the Fermi Seas) despite sometimes localized left and right single-particle eigenstates, as we demonstrate numerically and generalize to scenarios with finite temperatures and interaction. Interestingly, disorder contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may also allow strong-disorder delocalization. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and harbors interesting experiments and practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Optical effects in unmagnetized cold plasmas by a chiral axion factor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filipe S. Ribeiro, Pedro D. S. Silva, Manoel M. Ferreira Jr</p>
            <p>Unmagnetized cold plasma modes are investigated in the context of the chiral Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCJF) electrodynamics, where the axion chiral factor acts retrieving some typical properties of magnetized plasmas. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the dispersion relation, new refractive indices, and propagating modes. We find four distinct refractive indices modified by the purely timelike CFJ background that plays the magnetic conductivity chiral parameter role associated with right-circularly polarized (RCP) and left-circularly polarized (LCP) waves. For each refractive index, the propagation and absorption zones are determined and illustrated for some specific parameter values. Modified RCP and LCP helicons are found in the low-frequency regime. The optical behavior is investigated, revealing that the chiral factor induces birefringence, measured in terms of the rotatory power (RP). The dichroism coefficient is carried out for the absorbing zones. The negative refraction zones may enhance the involved rotatory power, yielding RP sign reversion, a feature of rotating plasmas and MCFJ chiral plasmas. Charge density oscillations and Langmuir waves are also discussed, revealing no modified dispersion relation due to the chiral axion factor.</p>

            <h2>Generalization vs. Specialization under Concept Shift</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Nguyen, David J. Schwab, Vudtiwat Ngampruetikorn</p>
            <p>Machine learning models are often brittle under distribution shift, i.e., when data distributions at test time differ from those during training. Understanding this failure mode is central to identifying and mitigating safety risks of mass adoption of machine learning. Here we analyze ridge regression under concept shift -- a form of distribution shift in which the input-label relationship changes at test time. We derive an exact expression for prediction risk in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal nontrivial effects of concept shift on generalization performance, including a phase transition between weak and strong concept shift regimes and nonmonotonic data dependence of test performance even when double descent is absent. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with experiments based on transformers pretrained to solve linear regression; under concept shift, too long context length can be detrimental to generalization performance of next token prediction. Finally, our experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST suggest that this intriguing behavior is present also in classification problems.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Ballini, Julius Mildenberger, Matteo M. Wauters, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hazar Çakır, Richard M. Milbradt, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dragan Marković, Mihailo Čubrović</p>
            <p>We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces, making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations. This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36% to 52% among more than one thousand candidate fragments. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approximately 20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for addressing data scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven machine learning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Guo, Frank X. Lee</p>
            <p>The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirakjyoti Sarma, Nilakshi Das</p>
            <p>The structure and dynamics of a harmonically confined three dimensional finite dust cluster are investigated via both Langevin Dynamics (LD) and frictionless Molecular Dynamics (fMD) simulation. The static structure of the system is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function, Center-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function. The intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P remains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell angular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD which are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two spherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the cluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation function in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as compared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD. Trajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common axis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction coefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the introduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster relaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular separation in LD as compared to fMD.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farhad Kamarei, Bo Zheng, John E. Dolbow, Oscar Lopez-Pamies</p>
            <p>Since the turn of the millennium, capitalizing on modern advances in mathematics and computation, a slew of computational models have been proposed in the literature with the objective of describing the nucleation and propagation of fracture in materials subjected to mechanical, thermal, and/or other types of loads. By and large, each new proposal focuses on a particular aspect of the problem, while ignoring others that have been well-established. This approach has resulted in a plethora of models that are, at best, descriptors of fracture only under a restricted set of conditions, while they may predict grossly incorrect and even non-physical behaviors in general. In an attempt to address this predicament, this paper introduces a vetting process in the form of nine challenge problems that any computational model of fracture must convincingly handle if it is to potentially describe fracture nucleation and propagation in general. The focus is on the most basic of settings, that of isotropic elastic brittle materials subjected to quasi-static mechanical loads. The challenge problems have been carefully selected so that: $i$) they can be carried out experimentally with standard testing equipment; $ii$) they can be unambiguously analyzed with a sharp description of fracture; and, most critically, $iii$) in aggregate they span the entire range of well settled experimental knowledge on fracture nucleation and propagation that has been amassed for over a century. For demonstration purposes, after their introduction, each challenge problem is solved with two phase-field models of fracture.</p>

            <p>Thermal and photothermal effects play an increasing role at the nanoscale due to the general decrease of thermal conductances and to the increasing role of interfaces. Here we present a non-contact optomechanical analysis of the thermal and photothermal properties of suspended nanowires based on pump-probe response measurements: a probe laser measures the nanowire deformations and property changes caused by an intensity-modulated pump laser launching thermal waves propagating along the 1D conductor. The analysis of the dominant photothermal contributions to the nanowires response in the spectral and spatial domains allows in particular to quantify the interfacial contact resistance, to detect its internal optical resonances and to image absorption inhomogeneities. Additionally, by exploiting the temperature-induced optical reflectivity changes of the nanowire, we directly image the spatial structure of the thermal waves propagating within the nanowire. Finally we investigate how those thermal waves are responsible for a dynamical modulation of the nanowire vibration frequency, in the resolved sideband regime, providing novel analytical tools to further inspect the structural properties of nano-optomechanical systems with a large signal to noise ratio. Those methods are generic and critical to correctly understand the photothermal dynamical back action processes and improve the intrinsic sensitivity of those ultrasensitive force probes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Schäfer, Claudio Chamon, Chris R. Laumann</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code -- the quintessential model of topological order -- hosts additional, emergent topological phases when perturbed: descendant fractional quantum Hall-like states, which we term \textit{Hall-on-Toric}. These hierarchical states feature fractionalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$ charges and increased topological ground-state degeneracy. The Hall-on-Toric phases appear in the vicinity of the transitions between deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_p$ phases with different background charge per unit cell, in a fixed non-trivial flux background. We confirm their existence through extensive infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations, analyzing the topological entanglement entropy, entanglement spectra, and a generalized Hall conductance. Remarkably, the Hall-on-Toric states remain robust even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry. Our findings reinforce the foundational interpretation of star and plaquette defects as magnetic and electric excitations, and reveal that this perspective extends to a much deeper level.</p>

            <p>We revisit the electronic structure and band topology of monolayer 1H-NbSe$_2$, which hosts both superconductivity and charge density wave, and its related compounds 1H-MoS$_2$, NbS$_2$, TaS$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$. We construct a 6-band, a 3-band, and - simplest of all - a single-band model for this material family, by directly Wannierizing the ab initio bands. All host obstructed atomic isolated bands away from the atomic positions near the Fermi energy. We find that in the 3-band model, the obstructed atomic Wannier function can be well approximated by an optimally compact Wannier function with more than 90% accuracy for all the compounds, rising to a remarkable 94% accuracy in NbSe$_2$. Interestingly, the simplest single-band model has next nearest-neighboring hopping larger than the nearest-neighboring hopping (by nearly an order of magnitude for MoS$_2$, NbSe$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$), which comes from the cancellation between the atomic onsite terms and the atomic nearest-neighboring hopping after projecting to the obstructed atomic Wannier functions. Furthermore for NbSe$_2$, we employ a novel approximation scheme to obtain an effective Hamiltonian that captures the 3 bands originating mainly from the Nb atom. We also use conventional perturbation theory to derive the ab initio obstructed Wannier function with 95% accuracy. Our results pave the way for future study of the effect of quantum geometry on the correlated phases in this family of materials.</p>

            <p>We study Andreev conversion in clean nanostructures containing an interface between graphene in the quantum Hall (QH) state and a superconductor, focusing on the lowest Landau level. First, several graphene nanostructures formed from zigzag edges with sharp corners are considered using a tight-binding model. We find the scattering state for an electron impinging on the interface from the upstream QH edge state, together with the probability of it exiting as a hole in the downstream QH edge state (Andreev conversion). From these results, we deduce the behavior for edges at an arbitrary angle and for rounded corners. A key issue is whether the graphene-superconductor interface is fully transparent or only partially transparent. For full transparency, we recover previous results. In contrast, interfaces with partial but substantial transparency (well away from the tunneling limit) behave very differently: (i) the hybrid electron-hole interfacial modes are not valley degenerate and (ii) intervalley scattering can occur at the corners, even when rounded. As a result, interference between the two hybrid modes can occur, even in the absence of disorder. Finally, we compare the sensitivity of Andreev conversion to interface transparency in the QH regime to that in the absence of a magnetic field. While the zero-field result closely follows the classic Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk relation, Andreev conversion in the QH regime is considerably more robust.</p>

            <p>Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz-2DCS) is transforming our ability to probe, visualize, and control quantum materials far from equilibrium. This emerging technique brings multi-dimensional resolution to the ultrafast dynamics of nonequilibrium phases of matter, enabling new capabilities demanding precise coherent control and measurement of many-body dynamics and multi-order correlations. By mapping complex excitations across time and frequency dimensions, THz-2DCS delivers coherence tomography of driven quantum matter, thus revealing hidden excitation pathways, measuring higher order nonlinear response functions, disentangling various quantum pathways, capturing collective modes on ultrafast timescales and at terahertz frequencies. These experimental features frequently remain obscured in traditional single particle measurements, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, and equilibrium-based probes. This Review traces the early development of THz-2DCS and showcases significant recent progress in leveraging this technique to probe and manipulate quantum material properties, including nonequilibrium superconductivity, nonlinear magnonics, dynamical topological phases, and the detection of novel excitations and exotic collective modes with potential technological impact. Looking forward, we identify critical opportunities in advancing THz-2DCS instrumentation and experimental strategies that are shaping future applications in THz optoelectronics, quantum information processing, and sensing.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.</p>

We construct a Ginzburg--Landau theory for the three superconducting order parameters, which correspond to the three irreducible representations of the point group $C_{3v}$.

We develop a systematic method to determine the symmetry-allowed terms and apply it to derive all terms up to fourth order in the three order parameters. The Ginzburg--Landau functional also includes coupling to the magnetic field. The functional is employed to determine the effect of an applied uniform magnetic field on the nodal structure for $A_1$ and $A_2$ pairing. The results facilitate clear-cut experimental differentiation between these symmetries. We also predict field-induced pair-density waves.</p>

The spectral composition of the effect exhibits a strong low-pass behavior, decreasing by approximately 75% from 0 THz to 0.2 THz and vanishing entirely at 1.5 THz. Using a dynamic magnetoresistive model, we can fully explain the spectral dependence by competition of transverse spin-torque (coherent) and longitudinal (incoherent) contributions to the spin current and their characteristic response times. Our analysis suggests that the slow dissipation of incoherent magnons from the interface is the limiting process responsible for the dramatic spectral decay of the SMR. These results establish THz SMR as a powerful probe of ultrafast interfacial spin-magnon coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens H. Nyhegn, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen, Leon Balents, Georg M. Bruun</p>
            <p>The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic octupole Hall effect in heavy transition metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Insu Baek, Seungyun Han, Hyun-Woo Lee</p>
            <p>d-wave altermagnets have the magnetic octupole as their primary order parameter. A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce Néel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.</p>

            <h2>Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological insulator nanowires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel F. Martínez, Adolfo G. Grushin, Jens H. Bardarson</p>
            <p>Crystalline topological insulator nanowires with a magnetic flux threaded through their cross section display Aharanov-Bohm conductance oscillations. A characteristic of these oscillations is the perfectly transmitted mode present at certain values of the magnetic flux, due to the appearance of an effective time-reversal symmetry combined with the topological origin of the nanowire surface states. In contrast, amorphous nanowires display a varying cross section along the wire axis that breaks the effective time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we use transport calculations to study the stability of the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and the perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological nanowires. We observe that at low energies and up to moderate amorphicity the transport is dominated, as in the crystalline case, by the presence of a perfectly transmitted mode. In an amorphous nanowire the perfectly transmitted mode is protected by chiral symmetry or, in its absence, by a statistical time-reversal symmetry. At high amorphicities the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations disappear and the conductance is dominated by nonquantized resonant peaks. We identify these resonances as bound states and relate their appearance to a topological phase transition that brings the nanowires into a trivial insulating phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. M. Ramos, F. M. Zimmer, M. Schmidt</p>
            <p>Motivated by theoretical and experimental studies reported by Yamaguchi et al. (Phys. Rev. B 98, 094402 (2018)), we performed a cluster mean-field analysis of an anisotropic Heisenberg model with six competing exchange interactions. We study the ground and thermal states by tuning the spin anisotropy, magnetic field, and temperature. Our results show that an external magnetic field induces quantum fluctuations, suppressing local moments and leading to the occurrence of a magnetization plateaulike state. When weak spin anisotropy is considered, the competing interactions are affected, and the field-induced fluctuations can lead to a well-defined magnetization plateau within a field range, in which an exotic quantum state can emerge. This state exhibits the coexistence of ferromagnetic and dimerized chains driven by the relation between frustration and the external field. Moreover, we identify a phase transition from a collinear antiferromagnetic order to a disordered state at a finite temperature. Our findings reveal unconventional magnetic properties at low temperatures that can guide future experimental studies of verdazyl-based compounds with anisotropic exchange interactions.</p>

            <h2>Radical scaling: beyond our feet and fingers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc-Antoine Fardin, Mathieu Hautefeuille, Vivek Sharma</p>
            <p>Scaling laws arise and are eulogized across disciplines from natural to social sciences for providing pithy, quantitative, `scale-free', and `universal' power law relationships between two variables. On a log-log plot, the power laws display as straight lines, with a slope set by the exponent of the scaling law. In practice, a scaling relationship works only for a limited range, bookended by crossovers to other scaling laws. Leading with Taylor's oft-cited scaling law for the blast radius of an explosion against time, and by collating an unprecedented amount of datasets for laser-induced, chemical and nuclear explosions, we show distinct kinematics arise at the early and late stages. We illustrate that picking objective scales for the two axes using the transitions between regimes leads to the collapse of the data for the two regimes and their crossover, but the third regime is typically not mapped to the master curve. The objective scales permit us to abandon the arbitrarily chosen anthropocentric units of measurement, like feet for length and heart-beat for time, but the decimal system with ten digits (fingers) is still part of the picture. We show a remarkable collapse of all three regimes onto a common master curve occurs if we replace the base 10 by a dimensionless radix that combines the scales from the two crossovers. We also illustrate this approach of radical scaling for capillarity-driven pinching, coalescence and spreading of drops and bubbles, expecting such generalizations will be made for datasets across many disciplines.</p>

            <p>Single-photon emitters (SPE) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising for applications ranging from single-photon sources to quantum sensors. Previous studies exclusively focused on the generation and characterization of SPEs in relatively thick h-BN layers ($\geq$ 30 nm). However, for electrical and magnetic sensing applications, the thickness of the h-BN limits the attainable spatial resolution. Here, we report the observation of blue-wavelength emitters (B-centers) activated by electron beam irradiation in ultra-thin ($\simeq$ 3 nm) h-BN. These SPEs in ultra-thin flakes exhibit reduced brightness, broader zero-phonon line, and enhanced photobleaching. Remarkably, upon encapsulation in thicker h-BN, we restore their brightness, narrow linewidth 230$\mu$eV at 5K, resolution limited), suppress photobleaching, and confirm single-photon emission with $ g^{(2)}(0) < 0.4$ at room temperature. The possibility of generating SPEs in a few-layer h-BN and their subsequent incorporation into a van der Waals heterostructure paves the way for achieving quantum sensing with unprecedented nanometer-scale spatial resolution.</p>

            <h2>Optimal boron-doped graphene substrate for glucose Raman signal enhancement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Komeda, Antonio Cammarata, Tomas Polcar</p>
            <p>Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is a highly sensitive and selective technique that greatly enhances the signal of an analyte, compared with its signal from classical Raman Spectroscopy, due to its interaction with a substrates surface. It has been shown that low concentration boron-doped graphene (B-graphene) enhances the Raman signal of simple organic molecules like pyridine. Recent studies also suggest that B-graphene can remain thermodynamically stable when doped with significantly higher concentrations of boron than previously observed. In this framework, we use quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the influence of dopant concentration and geometric distribution on the effectiveness of B-doped graphene as a SERS substrate, with glucose as analyte. By combining analysis of interatomic force constants and of phonon eigenvectors composition, we conclude that higher doping concentrations provide a larger enhancement to glucose's Raman signal, while the molecule orientation relative to the surface plays a fundamental role in the Raman response. We suggest that high concentration B-graphene presents itself as a potential substrate for SERS based detection of glucose, while the used phonon-based analysis can be promptly applied for the search of promising candidates as substrate materials for enhanced Raman response.</p>

Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jalil Varela-Manjarres, Yafei Ren, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons within two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by classical vector potential of fsLP are coupled to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory explains how fsLP, with central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a genuine nonequilibrium spintronic effect. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) reveals frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by nonlocal damping due to the bath of electrons. In addition, the TDNEGF part of our TDNEGF+LLG self-consistent loop computes a time-dependent density matrix whose off-diagonal elements are utilized to describe, at the mean-field level, inter-orbital Coulomb interaction binding electrons and holes into excitons. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory predicts how excited magnons {\em pump} charge current into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor responsible for microwave emission. The windowed FFT of the former signal contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</p>

            <p>We investigate the energy bands, magnetism, and superconductivity of bilayer octagraphene with A-A stacking under a perpendicular electric field. A tight-binding model is used to analyze the band structure of the system. The doubling of the unit cell results in each band of the single layer splitting into two. We find that applying a perpendicular electric field increases the band splitting. As the electric field strength increases, the nesting of the Fermi Surface(FS) weakens, eventually disrupting the antiferromagnetic order and bilayer octagraphene exhibits superconductivity. Spin fluctuations can induce unconventional superconductivity with s+--wave pairing. Applying a perpendicular electric field to bilayer octagraphene parent weakens the nesting of the FS, ultimately killing the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordered state and transitioning it into the superconducting state, whichworks as a doping effect. We use the random-phase approximation approach to obtain the pairing eigenvalues and pairing symmetries of the perpendicular electric field-tuned bilayer octagraphene in the weak coupling limit. By tuning the strength of the perpendicular electric field, the critical interaction strength for SDW order can be modified, which in turn may promote the emergence of unconventional superconductivity.</p>

Further, we show that the model belongs in the AI$^{\dagger}$ universality class of random matrices. In addition to this analysis, we investigate an emergent stripe-pattern in the spectrum and relate it to the dissipative parameters of the model.</p>

            <p>A single quantum emitter coupled to a structured non-Hermitian environment shows anomalous bound states and real-time dynamics without Hermitian counterparts, as shown in [Gong et al., Phys.

In this work, we establish a general approach for studying the scattering states of a single quantum emitter coupled to one-dimensional non-Hermitian single-band baths. We formally solve the exact eigenvalue equation for all the scattering states defined on finite periodic lattices. In the thermodynamic limit, the formal solution reduces to the celebrated Lippmann-Schwinger equation for generic baths. In this case, we find that the scattering states are no longer linear superpositions of plane waves in general, unlike those in Hermitian systems; Instead, the wave functions exhibit a large, yet finite localization length proportional to the lattice size. Furthermore, we show and discuss the cases where the Lippmann-Schwinger equation breaks down. We find the analytical solutions for the Hatano-Nelson and unidirectional next-to-nearest-neighbor baths in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henning Schlömer, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended pseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have been proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders such as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) and orthogonal metal (OM) phases. The topological nature of FL* and OM phases has been identified as scenarios compatible with a small Fermi surface without symmetry breaking, as suggested experimentally. With recent experimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between stripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative scenario: an orthogonal metal with a geometric origin (GOM) driven by fluctuating domain walls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the proliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real-space, but order is preserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result, well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist, which couple to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological excitations of the domain wall string-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface. At a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a transition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point (hQCP) featuring quantum critical transport properties. Our GOM framework establishes a deep connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases, and suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron and hole) doped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments with quantum simulators using ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits have demonstrated the potential of controlled dissipation as a versatile tool for realizing correlated many-body states. However, determining the dynamics of dissipative quantum many-body systems remains a significant analytical and numerical challenge. In this work, we focus on a dissipative impurity problem as a testbed for new methodological developments. We introduce an efficient non-perturbative framework that combines the superposition of Gaussian states (SGS) variational ansatz with the quantum trajectory approach to simulate open systems featuring a dissipative impurity. Applying this method to a spinful impurity subject to two-body losses and embedded in a bath of noninteracting fermions, we explore the full crossover from weak to strong dissipation regimes. The non-perturbative nature of the SGS ansatz allows us to thoroughly examine this crossover, providing comprehensive insights into the system's behavior. In the strong dissipation regime, our approach reproduces the finding that localized two-body losses can induce the Kondo effect [arXiv:2406.03527], characterized by a slowdown of spin relaxation and an enhancement of charge conductance. Furthermore, we reveal an exotic ``negative conductance" phenomenon at zero potential bias -- a counter-intuitive single-body effect resulting from intermediate dissipation and finite bandwidth. Finally, we investigate the formation of ferromagnetic domains and propose an extension to realize a higher-spin Kondo model using localized dissipation.</p>

The phonon exhibits a marked Kohn-type anomaly around the CDW wave vector, Q$_{\rm{CDW}}$, and becomes overdamped within a finite momentum range already well above T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The dispersion anomaly is consistent with potential Fermi surface nesting, which together with the extended phonon collapse indicate strong electron-phonon coupling. The transition temperature estimated from the phonon softening is markedly lower than T$_{\rm{CDW}}$, consistent with a primarily electronic instability rather than a phonon-driven transition. Our results establish UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as a prime example of a strongly correlated electron CDW system with exceptionally strong electron-phonon coupling driving phonon softening and collapse.</p>

            <p>The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</p>

            <p>The segregation of solutes to grain boundaries can significantly influence material behavior. Most previous computational studies have concentrated on substitutional solute segregation, neglecting interstitial segregation due to its increased complexity. The site preference, interstitial or substitutional, for P segregation in $\alpha$-Fe still remains under debate. In this work, we investigate the full GB-segregation spectrum for both substitutional and interstitial GB sites in a polycrystalline atomistic structure of ferrite with the aid of classical interatomic potentials combined with machine learning techniques. The method is qualitatively tested for H and Ni, where the segregation behavior in $\alpha$-Fe is well understood. Our findings for P show that segregation to both types of GB sites is possible, with a preference for the substitutional sites based on the mean segregation energy. However, due to the much larger number of interstitial sites, interstitial segregation significantly contributes to the GB enrichment with P. This underscores the importance of considering interstitial P segregation in addition to the substitutional one. Furthermore, we also argue that equally important for quantitative predictions (that agree with experimental data) is to get a representative spectrum of the segregation energies.</p>

In the quarter-metal phase, the spin and orbital moments align closely, providing a bound on the spin-orbit coupling energy. We also show that the half-metal phase has a very small magnetic anisotropy, which provides an experimental lower bound on the intervalley Hunds exchange interaction energy. This is found to be close to its theoretical upper bound. The ability to resolve the local isospin texture and the different interaction energies will allow a better understanding of the phase transition hierarchy and the numerous correlated electronic states arising from spontaneous and induced isospin symmetry breaking in graphene heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Reentrant localization transition induced by a composite potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingbo Wei</p>
            <p>We numerically investigate the localization transition in a one-dimensional system subjected to a composite potential consisting of periodic and quasi-periodic components. For the rational wave vector $\alpha=1/2$, the periodic component reduces to a staggered potential, which has been reported to induce the reentrant localization transition. In addition to $\alpha=1/2$, we find that other rational wave vectors can also lead to the reentrant phenomenon. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the reentrant localization transition, we vary the parameters of the composite potential and find that the reentrant localization transition is sensitive to the phase factor of the periodic component. By further studying the structure of the periodic component, we confirm that this sensitivity arises from the periodic phase factor modulating the mirror symmetry. Finally, we map out a global phase diagram and reveal that the reentrant localization transition originates from a paradoxical effect: increasing the amplitude of the periodic component enhances localization but simultaneously strengthens the mirror symmetry, which favors the formation of extended states. Our numerical analysis suggests that the interplay between these competing factors drives the reentrant localization transition.</p>

Assuming E$_g$ orbital (electric quadrupolar) orders in the cubic symmetry with the ordering wavenumber at the L points in the face-centered cubic lattice Brillouin zone as observed experimentally, we construct the Landau free energy and analyze it. We find that the unidentified high-temperature ordered phase under the magnetic field H ||[001] reported earlier can be interpreted as the consequence of the internal rotation in the orbital moments of f electrons at the Pr site. We discuss the phase diagram for various magnetic-field directions and also possible double-q quadrupolar orders in this system.</p>

            <p>Driven single-file motion sets the paradigm for wide variety of one-dimensional directed movements, ranging from intracellular transport and urban traffic to ant trails and controlled robot swarms. Motivated by the phenomenologies of these systems in closed geometries, regulated by number conservation and bottlenecks, we explore the domain walls (DWs) or shocks in a conceptual one-dimensional cellular automaton with a fixed particle number and a bottleneck. For high entry and exit rates of the cellular automaton, and with {sufficiently large} particle numbers, the DWs formed are independent of the associated rate parameters, revealing a {\em hitherto unknown universality} in their {\em shapes}. In contrast, the DWs do depend upon these parameters, if they are small, and hence have nonuniversal shapes. Our predictions on the DWs are testable in experiments.</p>

            <h2>Compressing local vertex functions from the multipoint numerical renormalization group using quantics tensor cross interpolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Frankenbach, Marc Ritter, Mathias Pelz, Nepomuk Ritz, Jan von Delft, Anxiang Ge</p>
            <p>The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jake Minten, Bhargav Rallabandi</p>
            <p>Tangential interactions between particles play a central role in suspension rheology. We show theoretically that these interactions, often attributed to contact friction, are a direct consequence of fluid flows between rough particles in relative motion. We find that small surface asperities generically lead to localized hydrodynamic sliding forces and torques that can exceed their smooth counterparts by orders of magnitude. A fully analytic thin-film theory shows that these forces grow inversely with the surface separation, significantly more singular than the logarithmic scaling for smooth particles. The impending singularity tightly constrains the particles' rotation with their translation, recovering a crucial ingredient in dense suspension rheology. Despite their purely hydrodynamic origin, these features resemble several aspects of dry rolling and sliding friction.</p>

We investigate detection prospects of pg-, ng-, and $\mu$g-scale detectors by calculating the scattering rate between dark matter and free electrons confined in two-dimensional graphene, including Pauli-blocking factors and in-medium screening effects. We find that the proposed detector is expected to not only serve as a complementary probe of super-light dark matter but also achieve higher experimental sensitivities than other proposed experiments, assuming zero readout noise, thanks to the extremely low threshold energy of our graphene Josephson junction sensor.</p>

            <h2>Classification of modular data up to rank 12</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siu-Hung Ng, Eric C. Rowell, Xiao-Gang Wen</p>
            <p>We use the computer algebra system GAP to classify modular data up to rank 12. This extends the previously obtained classification of modular data up to rank 6. Our classification includes all the modular data from modular tensor categories up to rank 12, with a few possible exceptions at rank 12 and levels $5,7$ and $14$. Those exceptions are eliminated up to a certain bound by an extensive finite search in place of required infinite search. Our list contains a few potential unitary modular data which are not known to correspond to any unitary modular tensor categories (such as those from Kac-Moody algebra, twisted quantum doubles of finite group, as well as their Abelian anyon condensations). It remains to be shown if those potential modular data can be realized by modular tensor categories or not. We provide some evidence that all may be constructed from centers of near-group categories or gauging group symmetries of known modular tensor categories, with the exception of a total of five cases at rank 11 (with $D^2 =1964.590$) and 12 (with $D^2 =3926.660$). The classification of modular data corresponds to a classification of modular tensor categories (up to modular isotopes which are not expected to be present at low ranks). The classification of modular tensor categories leads to a classification of gapped quantum phases of matter in 2-dimensional space for bosonic lattice systems with no symmetry, as well as a classification of generalized symmetries in 1-dimensional space.</p>

            <p>Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</p>

            <p>The dichotomy of localization versus delocalization is a historic topic central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. In sharp contrast to conventional formalisms through extended wavefunctions, these target systems exhibit delocalization in collective physical properties such as correlation and entanglement (of the Fermi Seas) despite sometimes localized left and right single-particle eigenstates, as we demonstrate numerically and generalize to scenarios with finite temperatures and interaction. Interestingly, disorder contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may also allow strong-disorder delocalization. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and harbors interesting experiments and practical applications.</p>

            <p>Unmagnetized cold plasma modes are investigated in the context of the chiral Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCJF) electrodynamics, where the axion chiral factor acts retrieving some typical properties of magnetized plasmas. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the dispersion relation, new refractive indices, and propagating modes. We find four distinct refractive indices modified by the purely timelike CFJ background that plays the magnetic conductivity chiral parameter role associated with right-circularly polarized (RCP) and left-circularly polarized (LCP) waves. For each refractive index, the propagation and absorption zones are determined and illustrated for some specific parameter values. Modified RCP and LCP helicons are found in the low-frequency regime. The optical behavior is investigated, revealing that the chiral factor induces birefringence, measured in terms of the rotatory power (RP). The dichroism coefficient is carried out for the absorbing zones. The negative refraction zones may enhance the involved rotatory power, yielding RP sign reversion, a feature of rotating plasmas and MCFJ chiral plasmas. Charge density oscillations and Langmuir waves are also discussed, revealing no modified dispersion relation due to the chiral axion factor.</p>

            <p>Machine learning models are often brittle under distribution shift, i.e., when data distributions at test time differ from those during training. Understanding this failure mode is central to identifying and mitigating safety risks of mass adoption of machine learning. Here we analyze ridge regression under concept shift -- a form of distribution shift in which the input-label relationship changes at test time. We derive an exact expression for prediction risk in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal nontrivial effects of concept shift on generalization performance, including a phase transition between weak and strong concept shift regimes and nonmonotonic data dependence of test performance even when double descent is absent. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with experiments based on transformers pretrained to solve linear regression; under concept shift, too long context length can be detrimental to generalization performance of next token prediction. Finally, our experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST suggest that this intriguing behavior is present also in classification problems.</p>

            <p>Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</p>

            <p>This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</p>

            <p>We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces, making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations. This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36% to 52% among more than one thousand candidate fragments. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approximately 20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for addressing data scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven machine learning.</p>

The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.</p>

            <p>The structure and dynamics of a harmonically confined three dimensional finite dust cluster are investigated via both Langevin Dynamics (LD) and frictionless Molecular Dynamics (fMD) simulation. The static structure of the system is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function, Center-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function. The intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P remains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell angular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD which are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two spherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the cluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation function in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as compared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD. Trajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common axis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction coefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the introduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster relaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular separation in LD as compared to fMD.</p>

            <p>Since the turn of the millennium, capitalizing on modern advances in mathematics and computation, a slew of computational models have been proposed in the literature with the objective of describing the nucleation and propagation of fracture in materials subjected to mechanical, thermal, and/or other types of loads. By and large, each new proposal focuses on a particular aspect of the problem, while ignoring others that have been well-established. This approach has resulted in a plethora of models that are, at best, descriptors of fracture only under a restricted set of conditions, while they may predict grossly incorrect and even non-physical behaviors in general. In an attempt to address this predicament, this paper introduces a vetting process in the form of nine challenge problems that any computational model of fracture must convincingly handle if it is to potentially describe fracture nucleation and propagation in general. The focus is on the most basic of settings, that of isotropic elastic brittle materials subjected to quasi-static mechanical loads. The challenge problems have been carefully selected so that: $i$) they can be carried out experimentally with standard testing equipment; $ii$) they can be unambiguously analyzed with a sharp description of fracture; and, most critically, $iii$) in aggregate they span the entire range of well settled experimental knowledge on fracture nucleation and propagation that has been amassed for over a century. For demonstration purposes, after their introduction, each challenge problem is solved with two phase-field models of fracture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Blom, Uwe Thiele, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>We construct the dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. For single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.</p>

            <p>The Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its generalisations to dissipative and dipolar gases have been very useful in describing dynamics of cold atomic gases, as well as polaritons and other nonlinear systems. For some of these applications the numerically accessible grid spacing can become a limiting factor, especially in describing turbulent dynamics and short-range effects of dipole-dipole interactions. We explore the application of tensor networks to these systems, where (in analogy to related work in fluid and plasma dynamics), they allow for physically motivated data compression that makes simulations possible on large spatial grids which would be unfeasible with direct numerical simulations. Analysing different non-equilibrium cases involving vortex formation, we find that these methods are particularly efficient, especially in combination with a matrix product operator representation of the quantum Fourier transform, which enables a spectral approach to calculation of both equilibrium states and time-dependent dynamics. The efficiency of these methods has interesting physical implications for the structure in the states that are generated by these dynamics, and provides a path to describe cold gas experiments that are challenging for existing methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge A. G. Attie, Emanuel A. L. Henn</p>
            <p>We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of dark solitons in a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a curved geometry. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in curvilinear coordinates and a perturbative expansion in the local curvature, we derive a set of coupled evolution equations for the soliton velocity and the curvature. For the case of constant curvature, such as circular geometries, the soliton dynamics is governed solely by the initial velocity and curvature. Remarkably, the soliton travels a nearly constant angular trajectory across two orders of magnitude in curvature, suggesting an emergent conserved quantity, independent of its initial velocity. We extend our analysis to elliptical trajectories with spatially varying curvature and show that soliton dynamics remain determined by the local curvature profile. In these cases, the model of effective constant curvature describes accurately the dynamics given the local curvature has smooth variation. When the soliton crosses regions of rapid curvature variation and/or non-monotonic behavior, the model fails to describe to soliton dynamics, although the overall behavior can still be fully mapped to the curvature profile. Our results provide a quantitative framework for understanding the role of geometry in soliton dynamics and pave the way for future studies of nonlinear excitations in curved quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Shapiro steps in a Cavity-Coupled Josephson ring condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nalinikanta Pradhan, Rina Kanamoto, M. Bhattacharya, Pankaj Kumar Mishra</p>
            <p>The Josephson effect presents a fundamental example of macroscopic quantum coherence as well as a crucial enabler for metrology (e.g. voltage standard), sensing (e.g. Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) and quantum information processing (Josephson qubits). Recently, there has been a major renewal of interest in the effect, following its observation in Bose, Fermi, and dipolar atomic condensates, in exciton-polariton condensates, and in momentum space. We present theoretically a nondestructive, \textit{in situ} and real time protocol for observing the AC and DC Josephson effects including integer (recently observed in cold atoms) and fractional (hitherto unobserved in cold atoms) Shapiro steps, using a ring condensate coupled to an optical cavity. Our analysis presents a metrology standard that does not require measurmement of atomic number and that challenges the conventional wisdom that quantum computations cannot be observed without being destroyed. Our results have implications for the fields of atomtronics, sensing, metrology and quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Floquet spin textures in optically pumped non-Hermitian surface states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Xiao Zhang, Naoto Nagaosa</p>
            <p>Optical effects of quantum matter with interaction are key to physics and technology. The class of non-Hermitian (NH) phenomena is mostly explored in cold atoms, photonics, and metamaterials out of equilibrium. Effective NH systems due to interaction in equilibrium solids, however, provide a unique opportunity for realizing light-NH matter hybrids via periodic irradiation. Given NH topological surface states with magnetic disorder, here we reveal spectroscopically observable Floquet spin textures for this hybrid quantum matter: merged meron strings, dichroic skyrmions, and domain structure accompanying vortices in energy planes; Bloch lines and topologically twisted vortex rings distinct from Hopfions in energy-momentum space; topological selectiveness of linear polarization occurs besides circular dichroism. Spectroscopic energy evolution and chemical potential dependence are key ingredients of this open hybrid system. With spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, this scenario bears prime physical interest by reaching the crossroad between solid-state interaction effects, non-Hermiticity, and light-matter coupling.</p>

            <p>Most superconducting materials are well-understood and conventional in the sense that the pairs of electrons that cause the superconductivity by their condensation have the highest possible symmetry. Famous exceptions are the enigmatic high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors. Nodes in their superconducting gap are the fingerprint of their unconventional character and imply superconducting pairing of $d$-wave symmetry. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe that the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ harbors nodes in its superconducting gap, implying unconventional $i$-wave pairing symmetry. At temperatures below $10\,\mathrm{K}$, the superconductivity in PtBi$_2$ gaps out its topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, while its bulk states remain normal. The nodes in the superconducting gap that we observe are located exactly at the center of the Fermi arcs, and imply the presence of topologically protected Majorana cones around this locus in momentum space. From this, we infer theoretically that robust zero-energy Majorana flat bands emerge at surface step edges. This not only establishes PtBi$_2$ surfaces as unconventional, topological $i$-wave superconductors but also as a promising material platform in the ongoing effort to generate and manipulate Majorana bound states.</p>

            <p>Noise from material defects at device interfaces is known to limit the coherence of superconducting circuits, yet our understanding of the defect origins and noise mechanisms remains incomplete. Here we investigate the temperature and in-plane magnetic-field dependence of energy relaxation in a low-frequency fluxonium qubit, where the sensitivity to flux noise and charge noise arising from dielectric loss can be tuned by applied flux. We observe an approximately linear scaling of flux noise with temperature $T$ and a power-law dependence of dielectric loss $T^3$ up to 100 mK. Additionally, we find that the dielectric-loss-limited $T_1$ decreases with weak in-plane magnetic fields, suggesting a potential magnetic-field response of the underlying charge-coupled defects. We implement a multi-level decoherence model in our analysis, motivated by the widely tunable matrix elements and transition energies approaching the thermal energy scale in our system. These findings offer insight for fluxonium coherence modeling and should inform microscopic theories of intrinsic noise in superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> JB Pendry, AJ Holden, DJ Robbins, WJ Stewart</p>
            <p>We show that microstructures built from non-magnetic conducting sheets exhibit an effective magnetic permeability, /mu_meff, which can be tuned to values not accessible in naturally occurring materials, including large imaginary components of /mu_meff. The microstructure is on a scale much less than the wavelength of radiation, is not resolved by incident microwaves, and uses a very low density of metal so that structures can be extremely lightweight. Most of the structures are resonant due to internal capacitance and inductance, and resonant enhancement combined with compression of electrical energy into a very small volume greatly enhances the energy density at critical locations in the structure, easily by factors of a million and possibly by much more. Weakly non-linear materials placed at these critical locations will show greatly enhanced effects raising the possibility of manufacturing active structures whose properties can be switched at will between many states</p>

            <p>Analog computers hold promise to significantly reduce the energy consumption of artificial intelligence algorithms, but commercialization has been hampered by a fundamental scientific challenge - how to reliably store and process analog information with high precision. We present an approach based upon metal oxide memory cells that undergo controlled self-heating during programming with a newly developed, electro-thermo-chemical gate. The gate uniformly spreads heat and electrochemical reactions to enable wide, bulk-vacancy modulation which yields nine orders of magnitude in tunable analog resistance - three orders greater than other devices reported, with thousands of states. The gating profoundly reduces noise and drift to enable precision programming to targeted states within a few operations, lowering conductance errors by two orders of magnitude relative to other devices reported. Simulations show improvement in computational energy efficiency by at least 10x over other devices due to far greater scalability at higher precision. The results overturn long-held assumptions about the poor reliability and precision of analog resistance devices and opens the door to manufacturable, bulk metal-oxide devices and new applications that leverage high precision.</p>

            <h2>Detection of 2D SPT phases under decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naren Manjunath, Alex Turzillo, Chong Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a bulk order parameter for extracting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) invariants of quantum many-body mixed states on a two dimensional lattice using partial symmetries. The procedure builds on the partial symmetry order parameter recently developed by some of the authors to study SPT phases of pure states and adapts them to the decohered setting. For a symmetry $G = E \times A$ where $E$ is a strong symmetry and $A$ is a weak symmetry, we show that the partial symmetry order parameter detects SPT invariants jointly protected by $E$ and $A$. We demonstrate this explicitly using a class of mixed states obtained from CZX-type models with $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and subjecting them to noise that weakens one of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. We also comment on the practical detection of SPT invariants in quantum simulators through randomized measurements.</p>

            <h2>Majorana zero modes in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures: Defining topology in short and disordered nanowires through Majorana splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haining Pan, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are bound midgap excitations at the ends of a 1D topological superconductor, which must come in pairs. If the two MZMs in the pair are sufficiently well-separated by a distance much larger than their individual localization length, then the MZMs behave as non-Abelian anyons which can be braided to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In this `topological' regime of well-separated MZMs, their overlap is exponentially small, leading to exponentially small Majorana splitting, thus enabling the MZMs to be topologically protected by the superconducting gap. In real experimental samples, however, the existence of disorder and the finite length of the 1D wire considerably complicates the situation leading to ambiguities in defining `topology' since the Majorana splitting between the two end modes may not necessarily be small in disordered wires of short length. We theoretically study this situation by calculating the splitting in experimentally relevant short disordered wires, and explicitly investigating the applicability of the `exponential protection' constraint as a function of disorder, wire length, and other system parameters. We find that the exponential regime is highly constrained, and is suppressed for disorder somewhat less than the topological superconducting gap. We provide detailed results and discuss the implications of our theory for the currently active experimental search for MZMs in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid platforms.</p>

            <h2>Robustness of real-space topology in moiré systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kryštof Kolář, Kang Yang, Felix von Oppen, Christophe Mora</p>
            <p>The appearance of fractional Chern insulators in moiré systems can be rationalized by the presence of a fictitious magnetic field associated with the spatial texture of layer-resolved electronic wavefunctions. Here, we present a systematic study of real-space topology and the associated fictitious magnetic fields in moiré systems. We first show that at the level of individual Bloch wavefunctions, the real-space Chern number, akin to a Pontryagin index, is a fragile marker. It generically vanishes except for specific limits where the Bloch functions exhibit fine-tuned zeroes within the unit cell, such as the chiral limit of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) or the adiabatic regime of twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). We then show that these limitations do not apply to textures associated with ensembles of Bloch wavefunctions, such as entire bands or the ensemble of states at a given energy. The Chern number of these textures defines a robust topological index protected by a spectral gap. We find that symmetries constrain it to be nonzero for both twisted TMDs and TBG across all twist angles and levels of corrugation, implying experimental signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. We also study real-space topology within the topological heavy fermion model of TBG, finding that the real-space topological features are supported only by the light c-electrons.</p>

After investigating the charge distribution across the interface, we identify the nature of the states around the gap and scrutinize their evolution as a function of the characteristic dimensions of the system (the graphene ribbons' width N and the boron nitride ribbons' width L). We also disclose how the very interface between graphene and boron nitride changes the electronic properties of both materials with respect to the corresponding isolated nanoribbons. Finally we discuss the light absorption properties of these systems by deriving specific selection rules for the heterostructures and calculating spectra from first principles in the independent particle and the random phase approximations</p>

            <p>Achieving high NV center conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in advancing diamond-based quantum technologies. The generally accepted mechanism for NV formation is that irradiation-induced vacancies become mobile during annealing and are trapped by substitutional nitrogen. However, the suggested mechanism does not consider the presence and role of hydrogen in the diamond and its influence on the NV formation pathway. This is despite ab-initio calculations, which strongly suggest the formation of hydrogen-passivated NV centers during CVD diamond growth. Recent experimental observations showing a strong spatial correlation between NV centers, brown coloration, and the 468 nm luminescence center in as-grown CVD diamonds prompted us to investigate the atomistic origin of these phenomena in the presence of NxVHy-type complex defects. We used hybrid density functional theory DFT calculations and spectroscopic analysis of CVD diamonds grown with varying nitrogen content to investigate defect equilibria during growth. We identified the 468 nm center as the NVH- defect, a hydrogen-passivated NV center, and assigned the characteristic UV-VIS absorption bands at 270 360 and 520 nm to NxVHy complexes. Our findings reveal that hydrogen plays a central role in stabilizing these defects during growth. We further showed that NVHx complex defects dissociate into NV centers and interstitial hydrogen during post-growth irradiation and annealing, complementing vacancy trapping by substitutional nitrogen. These results provide a unified picture of the defect chemistry underlying brown coloration, 468 nm center, and NV formation in CVD diamonds, offering new insights for optimizing diamond synthesis and processing for quantum applications by taking advantage of hydrogens role and dissociation of NVHx complexes.</p>

            <p>We study ultrafast photocurrents in thin films of a model ferromagnetic metal with broken bulk inversion symmetry, the half-metallic Heusler compound NiMnSb, following excitation with an optical pump pulse with photon energy 1.55 eV. Remarkably, in terms of the direction of the sample magnetization M, all photocurrents are found to be a superposition of a component with Rashba- and Dresselhaus-type symmetry. We explain the Dresselhaus bulk photocurrent as follows: Pump-induced electron heating induces an excess of spin {\mu}_s||M, which transfers spin angular momentum into states with Dresselhaus-type spin-momentum locking. The resulting charge current relaxes on a time scale of 10 fs by momentum relaxation and, thus, follows {\mu}_s quasi-instantaneously. The relaxation of {\mu}_s is governed by the cooling of the electrons and not by the significantly slower spin-lattice relaxation of half-metals. Our findings add the Dresselhaus spin-galvanic effect (SGE) to the set of ultrafast spin-charge-conversion phenomena. They indicate a route to more efficient spintronic terahertz emitters and detectors based on the volume scaling of the bulk SGE.</p>

            <p>The generation of pure spin currents is critical for low-dissipation spintronic applications, yet existing methods relying on spin-orbit coupling or ferromagnetic interfaces face challenges in material compatibility and operational robustness. We propose a paradigm-shifting approach to generate symmetry-protected pure spin currents by applying mechanical stress on insulating antiferromagnetic materials, i.e., the pure piezospintronic effect. We first classify magnetic point groups enabling pure piezospintronic effects. A novel first-principles method is developed to compute the spin dipole moments and coefficients of the piezospintronic effect. Integrating these methodologies with high-throughput screening, we identify FeOOH, Cr2O3 and NaMnX (X=As, Bi, P, Sb) with significant pure piezospintronic effects. Interestingly, we reveal that the ionic displacement contribution dominates the piezospintronic effect, in contrast to the piezoelectric effect. Our study not only provides first-principles approach for investigating spin dipole moment related phenomena (e.g., ferrotoroidicity, fractional quantum spin dipole moment, piezospintronics), but also provide promising piezospintronic materials for experimental verification and industrial applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. this http URL. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.</p>

            <p>Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) induces strong momentum-dependent spin splitting and plays a crucial role in fields like spintronics and topological photonics. We here theoretically investigate the collective excitations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) hosting RSOC, and conceive an approach to precisely quantify the strength of RSOC using plasmons. We determine the electron energy loss function (EELF) and plasmon dispersions for n-type ML-TMD from the dynamic dielectric function in the framework of the standard random phase approximation (RPA). In this system, both optical and acoustic plasmon modes are observed in the EELF and plasmon dispersions. Moreover, the plasmonic and spectral properties are tunable by electron density and dependent on RSOC. Crucially, we identify a minimum energy gap between the two plasmon modes to serve as a direct spectral signature of the RSOC strength. These results establish plasmons as a non-invasive, precise, and broadly tunable technique for determining RSOC in TMD van der Waals heterostructures and devices.</p>

Here, we report interfacial ferroelectricity in moiré superlattices constructed from graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. We observe ferroelectric polarization in an across-layer moiré superlattice with an intercalated layer, demonstrating a remnant polarization comparable to its non-intercalated counterpart. Remarkably, we reveal a magnetic-field enhancement of ferroelectric polarization that persists up to room temperature, showcasing an unconventional amplification of ferroelectricity in materials lacking magnetic elements. This phenomenon, consistent across devices with varying layer configurations, arises purely from electronic rather than ionic contributions. Furthermore, the ferroelectric polarization in turn modulates quantum transport characteristics, suppressing Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and altering quantum Hall states in polarized phases. This interplay between ferroelectricity and magneto-transport in non-magnetic materials is crucial for exploring magnetoelectric effects and advancing two-dimensional memory and logic applications.</p>

            <p>Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain (FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Strange metal behavior has been observed in an expanding list of quantum materials, with heavy fermion metals serving as a prototype setting. Among the intriguing questions is the nature of charge carriers; there is an increasing recognition that the quasiparticles are lost, as captured by Kondo destruction quantum criticality. Among the recent experimental advances is the measurement of shot noise in a heavy-fermion strange metal. We are thus motivated to study current fluctuations by advancing a minimal Bose-Fermi Kondo lattice model, which admits a well-defined large-$N$ limit. Showing that the model in equilibrium captures the essential physics of Kondo destruction, we proceed to derive quantum kinetic equations and compute shot noise to the leading nontrivial order in $1/N$. Our results reveal a strong suppression of the shot noise at the Kondo destruction quantum critical point, thereby providing the understanding of the striking experiment. Broader implications of our results are discussed.</p>

            <p>Molecular exciton-polaritons exhibit long-range, ultrafast propagation, yet recent experiments have reported far slower propagation than expected. In this work, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic disorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled microcavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation propagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy and its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using parameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that exciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons, particularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective light-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of these results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak resonance scattering. Overall, our results support the view that exciton-phonon interactions likely dominate the recent experimental observations of polariton slowdown in disordered media.</p>

            <p>We show that the dipole moment of an exciton is uniquely determined by the quantum geometry of its eigenstates, and demonstrate its intimate connection with a quantity we call the Quantum Geometric Dipole (QGD). The QGD arises naturally in semiclassical dynamics of an exciton in an electric field, contributing to the anomalous velocity differently from the Berry's curvature. In a uniform electric field QGD results in a drift velocity akin to that expected for excitons in crossed electric and magnetic fields, even in the absence of a real magnetic field. We compute the quantities relevant to semiclassical exciton dynamics for several interesting examples of bilayer systems with weak interlayer tunneling and Fermi energy in a gap, where the exciton may be sensibly described as a two-body problem. These quantities include the exciton dispersion, its QGD, and Berry's curvature. For two gapped-graphene layers in a vanishing magnetic field, we find the Quantum Geometric Dipole vanishes if the layers are identical, but may be non-zero when the layers differ. We further analyze examples in the presence of magnetic fields, allowing us to examine cases involving graphene, in which a gap is opened by Landau level splitting. Heterostructures involving TMDs are also considered. In each case the Quantum Geometric Dipole and Berry's curvatures play out differently. In some cases, the lowest energy exciton state is found to reside at finite momentum, with interesting possibilities for Bose condensation. We also find situations in which the QGD increases monotonically with exciton momentum, suggesting that the quantum geometry can be exploited to produce photocurrents from initially bound excitons with electric fields. We speculate on further possible effects of the semiclassical dynamics in geometries where the constituent layers are subject to the same or different electric fields.</p>

            <p>Ge and Si strained quantum wells have enabled the most advanced spin-qubit quantum processors, but they are deposited on defective, metamorphic SiGe substrates, which may impact device performance and scaling. Here we introduce an alternative platform, based on a heterojunction between unstrained Ge and a strained SiGe barrier, which is lattice-matched to a Ge substrate. In a structure with a 52-nm-thick strained SiGe barrier, we demonstrate a low-disorder two-dimensional hole gas with a high-mobility of 1.33$\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$/Vs and a low percolation density of 1.4(1)$\times$10$^1$$^0$ cm$^-$$^2$. Quantum transport measurements show that confined holes have a strong density-dependent in-plane effective mass and out-of-plane $g$-factor, pointing to a significant heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in agreement with theory. The expected strong spin-orbit interaction, possibility of isotopic purification, and ability to host superconducting pairing correlations make this platform appealing for fast quantum hardware and hybrid quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Uncertainty in AI-driven Monte Carlo simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Tzivrailis, Alberto Rosso, Eiji Kawasaki</p>
            <p>In the study of complex systems, evaluating physical observables often requires sampling representative configurations via Monte Carlo techniques. These methods rely on repeated evaluations of the system's energy and force fields, which can become computationally expensive. To accelerate these simulations, deep learning models are increasingly employed as surrogate functions to approximate the energy landscape or force fields. However, such models introduce epistemic uncertainty in their predictions, which may propagate through the sampling process and affect the system's macroscopic behavior. In our work, we present the Penalty Ensemble Method (PEM) to quantify epistemic uncertainty and mitigate its impact on Monte Carlo sampling. Our approach introduces an uncertainty-aware modification of the Metropolis acceptance rule, which increases the rejection probability in regions of high uncertainty, thereby enhancing the reliability of the simulation outcomes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Dehghani, Dominic Waldhoer, Angus Gentles, Pedram Khakbaz, Rainer Minixhofer, Michael Waltl</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive ab initio study of the influence of band structure corrections, particularly the electron effective mass, on the phonon-limited electron drift and Hall mobilities of GaAs. Our approach is based on the DFT+$U$ method, combined with an iterative solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation using the Wannier interpolation technique. We show how this framework allows for accurate refinements of the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion, leading to improved predictions for transport properties. In particular, by varying the Hubbard parameters to purposefully tune the conduction band features, allowing us to reproduce bands with different electron effective mass, we systematically investigate the relationship between mobility and effective mass. In this context, our results show close agreement with semi-empirical relations that follow a power-law dependence. Moreover, this approach can be used to indirectly incorporate temperature effects into the band structure, enabling efficient evaluation of temperature-dependent electron mobilities. Our mobility results exhibit good agreement with experimental data and are comparable to previously reported values obtained using the computationally expensive GW method.</p>

            <p>We present a novel method for generating potential landscapes in GaAs microcavities through focused $He^{+}$ implantation. The ion beam imprints micron-scale patterns of non-radiative centers that deplete the exciton reservoir and form a loss-defined potential minimum. Under non-resonant pumping, the resulting traps have a lateral size $\le 1.2 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$ and a three-dimensional mode volume of only $\approx 0.6 ~ \mathrm{\mu m^3}$, small enough to to support a single polariton condensate mode. The implantation process maintains strong coupling and provides lithographic ($ < 300 ~ \mathrm{nm}$) resolution. These loss-engineered traps effectively overcome the micrometer-scale limitations of conventional microcavity patterning techniques, opening new avenues for device development and polariton research within the quantum regime.</p>

            <h2>Photonic obstructed atomic insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Chen</p>
            <p>Topological quantum chemistry (TQC) classifies the topological phases by real-space invariants in which obstructed atomic insulators belong to the trivial case but sometimes show the feature of higher-order topological insulator. Here, for a two-dimensional magnetic photonic obstructed atomic insulator, we show that the emergence of corner states is associated with the Wyckoff positions. In such a square lattice with four +$M$ elements and four -$M$ elements, corner states appear when the superlattice exposes $2b$ Wyckoff positions. And the corner states will decrease when the number of exposed $2b$ Wyckoff positions decreases and disappears when $2b$ Wyckoff positions no longer stand at the edge. By arranging all the magnetic rods into one magnetization direction, we find that time-reversal symmetry is not important for corner states. Our finding indicates that the real-space distribution of atoms determines the feature of higher-order topological insulators for obstructed atomic insulators in TQC.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Wang</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics and heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems (i.e., the parameters of the system lie on the boundary of the stability conditions). We analytically examine two distinct critical classes: (i) diffusive criticality, where the variance grows linearly with suppressed/enhanced diffusion due to time-delayed forces, and (ii) oscillatory criticality, exhibiting oscillations with diffusing amplitude. Crucially, we derive asymptotic heat dissipation rates, revealing fundamentally different thermodynamic signatures: a constant dissipation rate for diffusive criticality and linear divergence accompanied by oscillations for oscillatory criticality. These results highlight how spectral properties of dynamics govern nonequilibrium thermodynamics in time-delayed systems. Our work bridges dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics at stability boundaries for linear systems, providing foundational insights for extending thermodynamic frameworks to nonlinear time-delayed stochastic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyrylo Simonov, Saptarshi Roy, Tamal Guha, Zoltán Zimborás, Giulio Chiribella</p>
            <p>Thermalization processes degrade the states of any working medium, turning any initial state into a passive state from which no work can be extracted. Recently, it has been shown that this degradation can be avoided if two identical thermalization processes take place in coherently controlled order, in a scenario known as the quantum SWITCH. In some situations, control over the order even enables work extraction when the medium was initially in a passive state. This activation phenomenon, however, is subject to a limitation: to extract non-zero work, the initial temperature of the medium should be less than half of the temperature of the reservoirs. Here we analyze this limitation, showing that it still holds true even when the medium interacts with $N\ge 2$ reservoirs in a coherently-controlled order. Then, we show that the limitation can be lifted when the medium and the control systems are initially correlated. In particular, when the medium and control are entangled, work extraction becomes possible for every initial value of the local temperature of the medium.</p>

            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be employed to understand a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particle scattering in high-energy physics to effective descriptions of many-body interactions in materials. Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits. Here, we investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit which prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics via a discretized time evolution. As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, while for strong confinement transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen. In addition, we demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a novel set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string dynamics.</p>

            <p>We establish thermodynamic stability and gauge invariance in the magnetovortical matter of Dirac fermions under the coexistent rotation and strong magnetic field. The corresponding partition function reveals that the orbital contribution to bulk thermodynamics preponderates over the conventional contribution from anomaly-related spin effects.

            <p>We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also compare these findings against earlier results for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can identify clear differences between phase transitions of first and second order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories and provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.</p>

            <h2>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</h2>

            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

Adding an intra-species coupling that induces an explicit soft symmetry-breaking, we determine the background pressure and we show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless Nambu- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. When the background velocities of the two superfluids are transonic, the system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustic horizons, finding that the emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet.</p>

            <p>We use Ising-like models to probe the thermal nature of Euclidean spacetime backgrounds. We determine which properties of the background -- curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature -- play a role in phase transitions. The geometries we use are Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-Nördstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS). Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature -- or Euclidean gravity -- increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature. Separately, since the selected geometries are position-dependent, the Ising-like models constructed on them are inhomogeneous, whereby they generalize the standard Ising model. We find that a consequence of this is that criticality does not correspond to maximal correlation lengths and scale invariance.</p>

            <p>We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Jie Huang, Yanzhu Chen</p>
            <p>In fault-tolerant quantum computing with the surface code, non-Clifford gates are crucial for universal computation. However, implementing these gates using methods like magic state distillation and code switching requires significant resources. In this work, we propose a new protocol that combines magic state preparation and code transformation to realize logical non-Clifford operations with the potential for fault tolerance. Our approach begins with a special logical state in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ surface code. By applying a sequence of transformations, the system goes through different topological codes, including the non-Abelian $D_4$ quantum double model. This process ultimately produces a magic state encoded in the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ surface code. A logical $T$ gate can be implemented in the standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code by gate teleportation. In our analysis, we employ a framework where the topological codes are represented by their topological orders and all the transformations are considered as topological manipulations such as gauging symmetries and condensing anyons. This perspective is particularly useful for understanding transformations between topological codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Calum A. Brown, Katarzyna Macieszczak, Robert L. Jack</p>
            <p>Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.</p>

            <p>A structural optimization scheme for a single-layer nonnegative adaptive tensor tree (NATT) that models a target probability distribution is proposed as an alternative paradigm for generative modeling. The NATT scheme, by construction, automatically searches for a tree structure that best fits a given discrete dataset whose features serve as inputs, and has the advantage that it is interpretable as a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.</p>

            <p>When a quantum system is prepared in its many-body ground state, it can be adiabatically driven to another ground state by changing its control parameter. However, relying on adiabaticity is experimentally unjustified. Moreover, the target value of the control parameter may occur outside the experimentally accessible range. The indicated target state, however, can still be reached within a clever protocol of temporal changes of the control parameter provided its decomposition into some basis is known. It turns out that such a protocol can be obtained in the framework of the optimal control theory. In this paper, we show how to apply such an optimization scheme to small quantum systems treating interaction strength as the control parameter. We believe that the proposed approach can be creatively extended to various complex quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates and associated with the late-time dynamics of cumulative out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs). Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</p>

            <p>We have studied the peculiarities of electron transport in one-dimensional (1D) disordered chain at the presence of correlations between on-site interaction and tunneling integrals. In the considered models the disorder in host-lattice sites positions is caused by presence of defects, impurities, existence of electron-phonon interaction, e.t.c. It is shown, that for certain combination of parameters the localization of electron state, inherited by a various of 1D disordered systems, disappear and electron transport becomes possible. The parameters of this transport are established.</p>

            <h2>An anomalous particle-exchange mechanism for two isolated Bose gases merged into one</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Q. H. Liu</p>
            <p>In an isolated ideal Bose system with a fixed energy, the number of microstates depends solely on the configurations of bosons in excited states, implying zero entropy for particles in the ground state. When two such systems merge, the resulting entropy is less than the sum of the individual entropies. This entropy decrease is numerically shown to arise from an effectively but anomalous exchange of particles in excited states, where $\overline{N}!/(\overline{N}_{1}!\overline{N}_{2}!)<1$. Here, $\overline{N}$, $\overline{N}_{1}$, and $\overline{N}_{2}$ are real decimals representing, respectively, the mean number of particles in excited states in the merged system and the two individual systems before merging, with $\overline{N}<\overline{N}_{1}+\overline{N}_{2}$.</p>

            <h2>Brightening interlayer excitons by electric-field-driven hole transfer in bilayer WSe2</h2>

            <p>We observe the interlayer A1s^I, A2s^I, and B1s^I excitons in bilayer WSe2 under applied electric fields using reflectance contrast spectroscopy. Remarkably, these interlayer excitons remain optically bright despite being well separated from symmetry-matched intralayer excitons-a regime where conventional two-level coupling models fail unless unphysically large coupling strengths are assumed. To uncover the origin of this brightening, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations and find that the applied electric field distorts the valence-band Bloch states, driving the hole wavefunction from one layer to the other. This field-driven interlayer hole transfer imparts intralayer character to the interlayer excitons, thereby enhancing their oscillator strength without requiring hybridization with bright intralayer states. Simulations confirm that this mechanism accounts for the major contribution to the observed brightness, with excitonic hybridization playing only a minor role. Our results identify interlayer hole transfer as a robust and general mechanism for brightening interlayer excitons in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), especially when inter- and intralayer excitons are energetically well separated.</p>

            <h2>Determining Exciton Binding Energy and Reduced Effective Mass in Metal Tri-Halide Perovskites from Optical and Impedance Spectroscopy Measurements</h2>

            <p>Accurate determination of the exciton binding energy and reduced effective mass in halide perovskites is of utmost importance for the selective design of optoelectronic devices. Although these properties are currently determined by several spectroscopic techniques, complementary theoretical models are often required to bridge macroscopic and microscopic properties. Here, we present a novel method to determine these quantities while fully accounting for polarization effects due to carrier interactions with longitudinal optical phonons. Our approach estimates the exciton-polaron binding energy from optical absorption measurements using a recently developed Elliott based Band Fluctuations model. The reduced effective mass is obtained via the Pollmann-Buttner exciton-polaron model, which is based on the Frohlich polaron framework, where the strength of the electron-phonon interaction arises from changes in the dielectric properties. The procedure is applied to the family of perovskites ABX3 (A = MA, FA, Cs; B = Pb; X = I, Br, Cl), showing excellent agreement with high field magnetoabsorption and other optical-resolved techniques. The results suggest that the Pollmann-Buttner model offers a robust and novel approach for determining the reduced effective mass in metal tri-halide perovskites and other polar materials exhibiting free exciton bands.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism</h2>

            <p>Altermagnetism is a collinear compensated magnetically-ordered phase with a d, g or i-wave anisotropy and alternating spin polarization of the electronic structure in the position and momentum space. Its recent discovery was in part motivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable spintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. After summarizing the diverse research context, we turn the focus of this review to the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We start from the description of spontaneously broken and retained symmetries which delineate the compensated altermagnetic ordering as a distinct magnetic phase. Next we focus on microscopic signatures and ordering mechanism of the altermagnetic phase. We highlight crystal-structure realizations of a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities in altermagnets, ranging from weakly-interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators. The symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin-orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout the review we compare altermagnetism to traditional ferromagnetism and Neel antiferromagntism, and to the currently intensely explored magnetic phases with non-collinear symmetry-protected compensated spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions by references to relevant experiments.</p>

By deriving the dynamical susceptibilities up to the third harmonic, we find remarkable NSOT-induced amplifications of the linear and nonlinear magnetic dynamics by orders of magnitude compared to conventional spin-orbit torques, enabling highly-efficient frequency conversion in the sub-terahertz frequency range. We then propose a multilayer antiferromagnetic nano-device leveraging the gigantic harmonic generation to achieve unprecedented frequency amplifiers and converters.

            <h2>Band-Gap Tunability in Anharmonic Perovskite-like Semiconductors Driven by Polar Electron-Phonon Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pol Benítez, Ruoshi Jiang, Siyu Chen, Cibrán López, Josep-Lluís Tamarit, Edgardo Saucedo, Bartomeu Monserrat, Claudio Cazorla</p>
            <p>The ability to finely tune optoelectronic properties in semiconductors is crucial for the development of advanced technologies, ranging from photodetectors to photovoltaics. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to achieve such tunability by utilizing electric fields to excite low-energy polar optical phonon modes, which strongly couple to electronic states in anharmonic semiconductors. We conducted a high-throughput screening of over $10,000$ materials, focusing on centrosymmetric compounds with imaginary polar phonon modes and suitable band gaps, and identified $310$ promising candidates with potential for enhanced optoelectronic tunability. From this set, three perovskite-like compounds --Ag$_3$SBr, BaTiO$_3$, and PbHfO$_3$-- were selected for in-depth investigation based on their contrasting band-gap behavior with temperature. Using first-principles calculations, \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations, tight-binding models, and anharmonic Fröhlich theory, we analyzed the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results show that polar phonon distortions can induce substantial band-gap modulations at ambient conditions, including reductions of up to $70\%$ in Ag$_3$SBr and increases of nearly $23\%$ in BaTiO$_3$, relative to values calculated at zero temperature, while PbHfO$_3$ exhibits minimal change. These contrasting responses arise from distinct electron-phonon coupling mechanisms and orbital hybridization at the band edges. This work establishes key design principles for harnessing polar lattice dynamics to engineer tunable optoelectronic properties, paving the way for adaptive technologies such as wavelength-selective optical devices and solar absorbers.</p>

            <p>Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step towards their application to superconducting electronics and quantum technologies. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.</p>

            <p>The superconducting phase of doped 1T-TiSe$_2$ is a fruitful playground for exploring exotic quantum phenomena such as the anomalous metal state and spontaneously formed superconducting network. Here, we address these emergent states by studying the superconducting gap of lithium intercalated TiSe$_2$-a fundamental quantity that has remained unexplored so far. We fabricate a device that combines solid-state lateral lithium intercalation, resistance measurements and tunneling spectroscopy. We successfully probe the superconducting gap of TiSe$_2$ and reveal that the gap closing temperature well exceeds the transition temperature ($T_c$) expected from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, indicating pronounced superconducting fluctuations even in a bulk-like system. Moreover, the symmetric gap persists even in the anomalous metal state, demonstrating the particle-hole symmetry of this exotic phase directly from the density of states. Finally, the superconducting gap shows magneto-oscillations with higher harmonics, attesting to a rather regular structure of the intrinsic superconducting network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nahoto Funaki, Kosei Sugiyama, Mitsuharu Uemoto, Tomoya Ono</p>
            <p>The effect of the nitrided layer introduced by NO annealing on the electronic structure and carrier scattering property of the 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface is investigated by the density functional theory calculation using the interface models where the areal N atom density corresponds to that in practical devices. The areal N atom density is one third of the areal C atom density in practical devices. It is found that the nitrided layer screens the unfavorable Coulomb interaction of O atoms in the SiO$_2$. However, the electrons flowing under the nitrided layer are significantly scattered by the fluctuation of potential due to the low areal N atom density. These results imply that the areal N atom density should be increased so that the fluctuation of potential is suppressed.</p>

            <p>This study provides a first-principles insight into half-Heusler CrMnSb to understand its deviation from the conventional Slater-Pauling semiconducting behavior. CrMnSb, having a valence electron count of 18, has been proposed to exhibit compensated ferrimagnetic character instead of the expected nonmagnetic semiconducting ground state. As half-Heusler systems with a valence electron count of 18 are not known to exhibit magnetic ordering, we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of CrMnSb using a combination of density functional theory and Green's function-based multiple-scattering theory. We show that, despite satisfying the 18 valence electron Slater-Pauling rule, CrMnSb does not exhibit ground-state nonmagnetic semiconducting behavior. Instead, it reveals a half-metallic, fully compensated ferrimagnetic ground state. This anomaly originates from the presence of localized sublattice moments, resulting from antiparallel alignment between Cr and Mn sublattices, which enforces half-metallic ferrimagnetism despite its ideal 18 valence electron count.</p>

            <h2>Spatial QUBO: Convolutional Formulation of Large-Scale Binary Optimization with Dense Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Yamashita, Hideyuki Suzuki</p>
            <p>The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Chen, Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma</p>
            <p>We study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving by an external field $H$ at different scales of driving rate $v_H$, where the noise strength $\sigma$ quantifies the deviation of the system size from the thermodynamic limit. For large systems with small $\sigma$, we find the coercivity $H_c=H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with increasing $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase from zero, stable plateau ($v_H^0$), $v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The $H_c$-plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to 0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the first-order phase transition (FOPT) point. In the post-plateau slow-driving regime, $H_c-H^*$ scales with $v_H^{2/3}$. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the coercivity plateau $H_P$ as $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing renormalization-group theory. These predicted scaling relations are demonstrated in magnetic hysteresis obtained with the Curie-Weiss model. Our work provides a panoramic view of the finite-time evolution of the stochastic $\phi^4$ model, bridges dynamics of FOPT and dynamic phase transition, and offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence strongly supports the existence of a second liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in deeply supercooled water leading to the co-existence of two phases: a high-and low-density liquid (HDL and LDL). While the thermodynamics associated with this putative LLCP has been well characterised through numerical simulations, the dynamical properties of these two phases close to the critical point remain much less understood. In this work, we investigate their dynamical and spectroscopic features using machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Dynamical analyses using the van-Hove correlation function, reveal that LDL exhibits very sluggish and heterogeneous molecular mobility, in contrast to the faster and more homogeneous dynamics of HDL. Infrared absorption (IR) spectra further show clear vibrational distinctions between LDL and HDL, in particular in the far IR region between 400 - 1000 cm-1. Together, these findings provide new dynamical fingerprints that clarify the microscopic behavior of supercooled water and offer valuable guidance for experimental efforts aimed at detecting the long-sought liquid-liquid transition.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation Pathways in a Photosynthetic Complex</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Gustin, Chang Woo Kim, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>Determining how energy flows within and between molecules is crucial for understanding chemical reactions, material properties, and even vital processes such as photosynthesis. While the general principles of energy transfer are well established, elucidating the specific molecular pathways by which energy is funneled remains challenging as it requires tracking energy flow in complex molecular environments. Here, we demonstrate how photon excitation energy is partially dissipated in the light-harvesting Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, mediating the excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting chlorosomes to the photosynthetic reaction center in green sulfur bacteria. Specifically, we isolate the contribution of the protein and specific vibrational modes of the pigment molecules to the energy dynamics. For this, we introduce an efficient computational implementation of a recently proposed theory of dissipation pathways for open quantum systems. Using it and a state-of-the-art FMO model with highly structured and chromophore-specific spectral densities, we demonstrate that energy dissipation is dominated by low-frequency modes ($<$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) as their energy range is near-resonance with the energy gaps between electronic states of the pigments. We identify the most important mode for dissipation to be in-plane breathing modes ($\sim$200 cm$^{-1}$) of the bacteriochlorophylls in the complex. Conversely, far-detuned intramolecular vibrations with higher frequencies ($>$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) play no role in dissipation. Interestingly, the FMO complex first needs to borrow energy from the environment to release excess photonic energy, making the energy dissipation dynamics non-monotonic. Beyond their fundamental value, these insights can guide the development of artificial light-harvesting devices and, more broadly, engineer environments for chemical and quantum control tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nianrui Fu, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan</p>
            <p>Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving non-Abelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multi-dimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to non-Abelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of non-Abelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of non-Abelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p>In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is highly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity is the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability of materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent directionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their crystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural piezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to leverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an integrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials with customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of truss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the topology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity. Then, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic piezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of photo-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework discovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic, unidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive manufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating these metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over 48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized metamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved metamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than its longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk materials. Our approach enables customizable piezoelectric responses and paves the way towards the development of a new generation of electro-active animate materials.</p>

            <h2>Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Falasca</p>
            <p>This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.</p>

            <p>Superconducting resonators with high quality factors are extremely sensitive detectors of the complex impedance of materials and devices coupled to them. This capability has been used to measure losses in multiple different materials and, in the case of circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED), has been used to measure the coherent evolution of multiple different types of qubits. Here, we report on the implementation of a scanning resonator for probing quantum coherent devices. Our scanning setup enables tunable coherent coupling to systems of interest without the need for fabricating on-chip superconducting resonators. We measure the internal quality factor of our resonator sensor in the single-photon regime to be > 10000 and demonstrate capacitive imaging using our sensor with zeptoFarad sensitivity and micron spatial resolution at milliKelvin temperatures. We then use our setup to characterize the energy spectrum and coherence times of multiple transmon qubits with no on-chip readout circuitry. Our work introduces a new tool for using circuit QED to measure existing and proposed qubit platforms.</p>

            <h2>Scaling Laws of Quantum Information Lifetime in Monitored Quantum Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bingzhi Zhang, Fangjun Hu, Runzhe Mo, Tianyang Chen, Hakan E. Türeci, Quntao Zhuang</p>
            <p>Quantum information is typically fragile under measurement and environmental coupling. Remarkably, we find that its lifetime can scale exponentially with system size when the environment is continuously monitored via mid-circuit measurements -- regardless of bath size. Starting from a maximally entangled state with a reference, we analytically prove this exponential scaling for typical Haar random unitaries and confirm it through numerical simulations in both Haar-random and chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of bath monitoring, the lifetime exhibits a markedly different scaling: it grows at most linearly -- or remains constant -- with system size and decays inversely with bath size. We further extend our findings numerically to a broad class of initial states. We discuss implications for monitored quantum circuits in the weak measurement limit, quantum algorithms such as quantum diffusion models and quantum reservoir computing, and quantum communication. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of resolving the predicted scaling regimes experimentally via noisy simulations of IBM Quantum hardwares.</p>

            <p>Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Insights into Ionic Diffusion in C-S-H Gel Pore from MD Simulations: Spatial Distributions, Energy Barriers, and Structural Descriptor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiqiang Chen, Kai Gong</p>
            <p>Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to many natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its molecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate Na+, Cl-, and water diffusion inside a 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging from 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of diffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the pore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of activation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel, showing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural analysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to hydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the pore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was introduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and molecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond 1 nm, suppressed diffusivities were well captured by an exponential decay model based on the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of transport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena and suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry of cementitious gels, such as surface coordination environments, pore size distributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress ionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.</p>

            <h2>On Boltzmann Averaging in Ab Initio Thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendrik H. Heenen, Karsten Reuter</p>
            <p>Ab initio thermodynamics is a widespread, computationally efficient approach to predict the stable configuration of a surface in contact with a surrounding (gas or liquid) environment. In a prevalent realization of this approach, this stable configuration is simply equated with the structure in a considered candidate pool that exhibits the lowest surface free energy. Here we discuss the possibility to consider the thermal accessibility of competing, higher-energy configurations through Boltzmann averaging when the extended surface configurations and their energetics are computed within periodic boundary condition supercells. We show analytically that fully converged averages can be obtained with a candidate pool derived from exhaustive sampling in a surface unit-cell exceeding the system's correlation length. In contrast, averaging over a small pool of ad hoc assembled structures is generally ill-defined. Enumerations of a lattice-gas Hamiltonian model for on-surface oxygen adsorption at Pd(100) are employed to illustrate these considerations in a practical context.</p>

Our approach allows for the creation of spin-split bands and the corresponding transport properties provide an effective platform for circularly polarized light isolation without the need of geometrodynamic spin-orbit interaction. Beyond the concurrent solid-state materials, we anticipate our work to offer photonic crystals as a versatile platform to test the spin-split band properties and inspire optical designs for photospintronic applications.</p>

            <p>The information scrambling phenomena in an open quantum system modeled by Ising spin chains coupled to Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) baths are observed via an interferometric method for obtaining out-of-time-ordered correlators ($\mathcal{F}-$OTOC). We also use an anisotropic bath connecting to a system of tilted field Ising spin chain in order to confirm that such situations are suitable for the emergence of ballistic spreading of information manifested in the light cones in the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC profiles. Bipartite OTOC is also calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively in the symmetry-broken phase.</p>

            <p>Quantum solutions to differential equations represent quantum data -- states that contain relevant information about the system's behavior, yet are difficult to analyze. We propose a toolbox for reading out information from such data, where customized quantum circuits enable efficient extraction of flow properties. We concentrate on the process referred to as quantum vortex detection (QVD), where specialized operators are developed for pooling relevant features related to vorticity. Specifically, we propose approaches based on sliding windows and quantum Fourier analysis that provide a separation between patches of the flow field with vortex-type profiles. First, we show how contour-shaped windows can be applied, trained, and analyzed sequentially, providing a clear signal to flag the location of vortices in the flow. Second, we develop a parallel window extraction technique, such that signals from different contour positions are coherently processed to avoid looping over the entire solution mesh. We show that Fourier features can be extracted from the flow field, leading to classification of datasets with vortex-free solutions against those exhibiting Lamb-Oseen vortices. Our work exemplifies a successful case of efficiently extracting value from quantum data and points to the need for developing appropriate quantum data analysis tools that can be trained on them.</p>

            <h2>Topological Holography: Towards a Unification of Landau and Beyond-Landau Physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heidar Moradi, Seyed Faroogh Moosavian, Apoorv Tiwari</p>
            <p>We outline a holographic framework that attempts to unify Landau and beyond-Landau paradigms of quantum phases and phase transitions. Leveraging a modern understanding of symmetries as topological defects/operators, the framework uses a topological order to organize the space of quantum systems with a global symmetry in one lower dimension. The global symmetry naturally serves as an input for the topological order. In particular, we holographically construct a String Operator Algebra (SOA) which is the building block of symmetric quantum systems with a given symmetry $G$ in one lower dimension. This exposes a vast web of dualities which act on the space of $G$-symmetric quantum systems. The SOA facilitates the classification of gapped phases as well as their corresponding order parameters and fundamental excitations, while dualities help to navigate and predict various corners of phase diagrams and analytically compute universality classes of phase transitions. A novelty of the approach is that it treats conventional Landau and unconventional topological phase transitions on an equal footing, thereby providing a holographic unification of these seemingly-disparate domains of understanding. We uncover a new feature of gapped phases and their multi-critical points, which we dub fusion structure, that encodes information about which phases and transitions can be dual to each other. Furthermore, we discover that self-dual systems typically posses emergent non-invertible, i.e., beyond group-like symmetries. We apply these ideas to $1+1d$ quantum spin chains with finite Abelian group symmetry, using topologically-ordered systems in $2+1d$. We predict the phase diagrams of various concrete spin models, and analytically compute the full conformal spectra of non-trivial quantum phase transitions, which we then verify numerically.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huaisong Zhao, Feng Yuan, Tianxing Ma, Peng Zou</p>
            <p>The measurement of the pairing gap plays an essential role in studying the physical properties of superconductors or superfluids. We develop a strategy for measure the pairing gap through the dynamical excitations. With the random phase approximation (RPA), the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional attractive Fermi-Hubbard model are studied by calculating the dynamical structure factor. Two distinct collective modes are investigated: a Goldstone phonon mode at the transferred momentum ${\bf q}=\left[0,0\right]$ and a roton mode at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$. The roton mode demonstrates a sharp molecular peak in the low-energy regime. Remarkably, the area under the roton molecular peak scales with the square of the pairing gap, which persists even in three-dimensional and spin-orbit coupled (SOC) optical lattices. This result provides a potential strategy to measure the pairing gap of lattice systems experimentally by measuring the dynamical structure factor at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$.</p>

            <h2>Ab initio modelling of quantum dot qubits: Coupling, gate dynamics and robustness versus charge noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamza Jnane, Simon C Benjamin</p>
            <p>Electron spins in semiconductor devices are highly promising building blocks for quantum processors (QPs). Commercial semiconductor foundries can create QPs using the same processes employed for conventional chips, once the QP design is suitably specified. There is a vast accessible design space; to identify the most promising options for fabrication, one requires predictive modelling of interacting electrons in real geometries and complex non-ideal environments. In this work we explore a modelling method based on real-space grids, an ab initio approach without assumptions relating to device topology and therefore with wide applicability. Given an electrode geometry, we determine the exchange coupling between quantum dot qubits, and model the full evolution of a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate to predict qubit loss and infidelity rates for various voltage profiles. We determine full, 3D solutions and introduce a method which can obtain near-identical predictions using far more efficient 2D computations. Moreover we explore the impact of unwanted charge defects (static and dynamic) in the environment, and test robust pulse sequences. As an example we exhibit a sequence correcting both systematic errors and (unknown) charge defects, observing an order of magnitude boost in fidelity. The technique can thus identify the most promising device designs for fabrication, as well as bespoke control sequences for each such device.</p>

            <p>In magnetic topological insulators, spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking by intrinsic magnetic order can gap the topological surface spectrum, resulting in exotic properties like axion electrodynamics, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and other topological magnetoelectric responses. Understanding the magnetic order and its coupling to topological states is essential to harness these properties. Here, we leverage near-resonant magnetic dipole optical second harmonic generation to probe magnetic fluctuations in the candidate axion insulator EuSn$_2$(As,P)$_2$ across its antiferromagnetic phase boundary. We observe a pronounced dimensional crossover in the quantum decoherence induced by magnetic fluctuations, whereby two-dimensional in-plane ferromagnetic correlations at high temperatures give way to three-dimensional long-range order at the Néel temperature. We also observe the breaking of rotational symmetry within the long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic state and map out the resulting spatial domain structure. More generally, we demonstrate the unique capabilities of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to study quantum coherence and fluctuations in magnetic quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Gonzalo Usaj, Nathan Goldman</p>
            <p>The Středa formula establishes a fundamental connection between the topological invariants characterizing the bulk of topological matter and the presence of gapless edge modes. In this work, we extend the Středa formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems, while offering a link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-Středa response is regularized through Cesàro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk, and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-Středa response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally-invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-Středa response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.</p>

For weak interactions, in contrast, the ground state is given by the harmonic trap. In this work, we conduct a variational study of the transition between these two limits. We find that this transition occurs abruptly at the critical interaction strength whose value is universal if scaled appropriately with the number of particles. To connect the abrupt change in the properties of the system to the classical description of phase transitions, we analyze the static response of the Bose gas related to the isothermal compressibility. Finally, we perform numerically exact calculations for a few particles to demonstrate the effects of finite range interactions on this transition. We conclude that finite range effects wash out the point of transition.</p>

            <p>In magnetic systems, angular momentum is carried by spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Nonlocal devices, comprising heavy-metal nanowires on magnetic insulators like yttrium iron garnet (YIG), enable angular momentum transport via magnons. These magnons are polarized by spin accumulation at the interface through the spin Hall effect (SHE) and detected via the inverse SHE (iSHE). The processes are generally reciprocal, as demonstrated by comparable efficiencies when reversing injector and detector roles. However, introducing Ru, which enables the orbital Hall effect (OHE), disrupts this reciprocity. In our system, magnons polarized through combined SHE and OHE and detected via iSHE are 35% more efficient than the reverse process. We attribute this nonreciprocity to nonzero spin vorticity, resulting from varying electron drift velocities across the Pt/Ru interface. This study highlights the potential of orbital transport mechanisms in influencing angular momentum transport and efficiency in nonlocal spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>We simulate interaction quenches crossing from a superfluid to a supersolid state in a dipolar quantum gas of ${}^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms, trapped in an elongated tube with periodic boundary conditions, via the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A freeze-out time is observed through a delay in supersolid formation after crossing the critical point. We compute the density-density correlations at the freeze-out time and extract the frozen correlation length for the solid order. An analysis of the freeze-out time and correlation length versus the interaction quench rate allows us to extract universal exponents corresponding to the relaxation time and correlation length based on predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Over several orders of magnitude, clear power-law scaling is observed for both the freeze-out time and the correlation length, and the corresponding exponents are compatible with predictions based on the excitation spectrum calculated via Bogoliubov theory. Defects due to independent local breaking of translational symmetry, contributing to globally incommensurate supersolid order, are identified, and their number at the freeze-out time is found to also scale as a power law. Our results support the hypothesis of a continuous transition whose universality class remains to be determined but appears to differ from that of the (1+1)D XY model.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-induced phase transition in periodically driven free-fermionic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pallabi Chatterjee, Ranjan Modak</p>
            <p>It is well known that unitary evolution tends to increase entanglement, whereas continuous monitoring counteracts this growth by pinning the wavefunction trajectories to the eigenstates of the measurement operators. In this work, we investigate the fate of the measurement-induced phase transition in a periodically driven free-fermionic quantum system, where the hopping amplitude is modulated periodically in time using a square pulse. In the high-frequency limit, a renormalization group analysis of the non-Hermitian quantum sine-Gordon model [as proposed in {Phys. Rev. X 11, 041004 (2021)}] reveals that if the hopping amplitude is varied symmetrically around zero, the system always favors the area-law phase, where the steady-state entanglement entropy is independent of subsystem size. In contrast, asymmetry in the drive amplitudes tends to promote entanglement growth. Furthermore, numerical evidence for the system sizes accessible to us suggests that decreasing the drive frequency typically favors entanglement growth. For such driven systems, at least for reasonably small frequency regimes, as a function of measurement strength, we observe a potential signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition between a gapless critical phase, characterized by logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy with subsystem size, and a gapped area-law phase. However, it is almost impossible to rule out the possibility that the transition observed here is not an actual thermodynamic transition, but a finite-size crossover between logarithmic to area law entanglement phase. Even in that scenario, the critical length scale beyond which the area law phase prevails increases with the increasing time period of driving. On the other hand, for a symmetric drive, the system consistently exhibits an area-law phase, regardless of the driving frequency.</p>

            <p>Fermionic superfluid junctions typically exhibit suppressed thermal and spin transport due to the presence of a pairing gap but allow coherent particle transport. While dissipation generally weakens coherent transport, it can also induce excitations that open other transport channels. In this work, we experimentally study a one-dimensional superfluid junction of strongly interacting fermions with local particle loss and observe dissipation-induced thermal and spin transport that appear to saturate at strong dissipation. Notably, in this regime, the measured thermal and spin conductances are comparable to the universal quantized conductance of one-dimensional ideal Fermi gas. Qualitatively similar behavior is observed for two dissipation mechanisms, either spin-imbalanced or pairwise losses. Our findings provide new insights into transport in interacting open quantum systems and suggest possibilities of dissipative control of spin and thermoelectric transport.</p>

We analyze the flow of an electronic fluid with a finite odd viscosity in the presence of such disorder and compute the conductivity tensor. We find that in the generic case of finite intrinsic conductivity, the Hall angle in the viscous regime is parametrically suppressed compared to the elastic regime. In the special case where the intrinsic conductivity vanishes, the ratio between the transverse and the longitudinal resistivities matches the ratio between the odd and even components of the viscosity tensor.</p>

            <p>Experiments have reached a monumental capacity for designing and synthesizing microscopic particles for self-assembly, making it possible to precisely control particle concentrations, shapes, and interactions. However, more physical insight is needed before we can take full advantage of this vast design space to assemble nanostructures with complex form and function. Here we show how a significant part of this design space can be quickly and comprehensively understood by identifying a class of thermodynamic constraints that act on it. These thermodynamic constraints form a high-dimensional convex polyhedron that determines which nanostructures can be assembled at high equilibrium yield and reveals limitations that govern the coexistence of structures, which we verify through detailed, quantitative assembly experiments of nanoscale particles synthesized using DNA origami. Strong experimental agreement confirms the importance of the polyhedral structure and motivates its use as a predictive tool for the rational design of self-assembly. These results uncover fundamental physical relationships underpinning many-component programmable self-assembly in equilibrium and form the basis for robust inverse-design, applicable to a wide array of systems from biological protein complexes to synthetic nanomachines.</p>

Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.</p>

            <p>Relying on the anharmonic special displacement method, we introduce an ab initio quasistatic polymorphous framework to describe local disorder, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon coupling in superionic conductors. Using the example of cubic Cu2Se, we show that positional polymorphism yields extremely overdamped anharmonic vibrations while preserving transverse acoustic phonons, consistent with experiments. We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements. Our approach opens the way for efficient ab initio electronic structure calculations in superionic crystals to elucidate their compelling high figure-of-merit.</p>

            <h2>When Homogeneous Systems Meet Dissipation and Disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xixi Feng, Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Gao Xianlong, Shujie Cheng</p>
            <p>We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of bond dissipation and disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial system is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial system strengthens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.</p>

            <p>A new thermal bath scheme for Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg) is introduced. New game moves for sampling the given temperature are achieved via Monte Carlo dynamics of both Metropolis and Glauber in a stochastic game. This kind of approach makes the game an ideal tool for demonstrating thermal dependency of entropy production in a novel way. Using this new approach, Ising-Conway Entropy game rate of entropy production depending on different temperatures is explored. Thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and a plausible test bed for studying complex dynamical systems in classical statistical mechanics, that is conceptually simple, pedagogically accessible, yet realistic.</p>

Using linear spin wave theory, we show that entropy favors these multi-$\vec{Q}$ states at low temperatures in high magnetic fields. This is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations, and a phase diagram is constructed. We also calculate the zero-temperature dynamical structure factor. Besides the usual Goldstone modes associated with the ordering $\vec{Q}$s, we find high intensity gapless modes at momenta where there are no Bragg peaks.</p>

            <p>The study of strongly correlated electron systems remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) systems hosting various exotic phases of matter including quantum spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological orders. Although Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has established itself as a pillar for simulating one-dimensional quantum systems, its application to 2D systems has long been hindered by the notorious ``local minimum'' issues. Recent methodological breakthroughs have addressed this challenge by incorporating Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions as initial states for DMRG simulations. This hybrid approach, referred to as DMRG guided by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions (or Gutzwiller-guided DMRG), has demonstrated remarkable improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to explore exotic quantum phases such as topological orders. This review examines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, details key algorithmic developments, and showcases its applications in recent studies of 2D quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Li, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>In this paper, we derive the equations of motion for a system composed of a spinless quantum dot coupled to two normal leads and two Majorana bound states (MBSs), utilizing the auxiliary-mode expansion method and the nonequilibrium Green function technique. Subsequently, we use these equations to analyze the linear conductance, adiabatic linear capacitance, and adiabatic linear relaxation resistance of the system. We find that when the phase difference between the two MBSs is an integer multiple of $\pi$, the MBSs enter the zero mode, leading to the complete suppression of the linear relaxation resistance. In this case, the relaxation resistance is highly sensitive to the MBSs modes. On the other hand, when the phase difference is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, the linear conductance is fully suppressed. Furthermore, the linear relaxation resistance remains completely suppressed, even when the MBSs are not in the zero mode, and the system loses its sensitivity to the MBSs modes.</p>

            <p>Flexoelectricity, polarization induced by strain gradients, is especially pronounced in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their mechanical flexibility and sensitivity to mechanical deformation. In nanostructures with sub-nm curvature, this effect is governed by quantum-mechanical polarization and electrostatic modulation, not merely classical lattice distortion. Here, we present the first direct experimental and theoretical demonstration of large intrinsic quantum flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles, exhibiting polarization densities (P_{th} ~ 4 C/m^{2}, P_{exp} ~ 1 C/m^{2}) that exceed those of mesoscale systems by 5 to 7 orders of magnitude. These nanowrinkles, with sub-nm radii of curvature at their apex, undergo atomic-level buckling and result in localized strain fields, as confirmed by sub-micron Raman spectroscopy. These curvatures create an asymmetry to {\pi}-orbital interactions across the atomic layer, which, in turn, leads to localized polarization densities. Kelvin probe force microscopy reveals curvature-dependent work function shifts consistent with flexoelectric polarization, while conductive atomic force microscopy detects reproducible flexoelectric currents exhibiting a threshold voltage ({\Phi}th ~1 V) that matches the band offset predicted by ab initio calculations (~1.2 V). Together, these results confirm how flexoelectric dipoles reshape the local electronic potential. Graphene nanowrinkles thus provide a pristine platform for uncovering quantum-mechanical flexoelectricity: a fundamentally ubiquitous effect, whose study in the simplest crystalline material can illuminate electromechanical behavior across condensed matter, soft matter, and biological systems.</p>

            <p>In recent years scale invariant scattering theory provided the first exact access to the magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional statistical systems with quenched disorder.

            <p>Bare Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface atoms exhibit a buckled structure where one Si atom in a dimer is lowered while the other is raised, leading to two possible buckling configurations equivalent in energy. The relatively low energy barrier between these configurations allows dimers to flip rapidly and uncontrollably unless stabilized by surface defects or observed at low temperatures due to reduced thermal energy using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged symmetric appearance under STM. In this study, we investigated variable length buckled dimer wires on the hydrogenated Si(100) surface composed of silicon dangling bonds for the first time. We demonstrate that on degenerate p-type silicon at 4.5 K, the rapid switching of these dimers can be frozen at low scanning biases. Such buckled wires can however be controllably flipped using a bias pulse. A line as long as 37 dimers was repeatedly uniformly flipped by a single pulse delivered near one terminus of the wire. The tip-directed flipping of a particular wire does not switch adjacent wires, suggesting binary wires can make well isolated rewritable binary memory elements. Furthermore, at sufficiently high biases switching generates telegraph noise that could be of utility for random number generation. The integration and encapsulation of these wires with previously described silicon dangling bond-made logic gates and binary wires might allow for self contained actuation and readout without requiring any role of an STM tip.</p>

            <p>Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</p>

            <h2>Extended Structural Dynamics -- Emergent Irreversibility from Reversible Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick BarAvi</p>
            <p>The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central problem in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are constrained to dilute gases and short timescales. In this work, we introduce Extended Structural Dynamics (ESD), a deterministic framework in which irreversibility arises from the internal geometry of structured particles. In ESD, particles possess finite size and internal degrees of freedom, such as rotation and vibration, that are dynamically coupled to translational motion. This coupling induces instability, nonlinear feedback, and chaotic mixing in the extended phase space, even under time-reversal symmetric laws. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible volume of phase space, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) form measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times scaling as Trec. These results address the Loschmidt and Zermelo paradoxes without coarse-graining, randomness, or fine-tuning. We further extend the model to charged systems (cESD), where long-range electromagnetic interactions drive continuous structural coupling. ESD thus provides a deterministic and testable mechanism for emergent thermodynamic behavior, with applications ranging from mesoscopic systems to the cosmological arrow of time.</p>

            <h2>Unified Magnetoelectric Mechanism for Spin Splitting in Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Mera Acosta</p>
            <p>We identify a relativistic magnetoelectric correction that completes the theoretical description of spin splitting (SS) in magnetic systems. Derived from the Dirac equation, this term couples local magnetic moments to the scalar electric potential, providing a third fundamental mechanism, alongside Zeeman and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), that governs SS in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. In compensated magnets, the correction depends on the difference in electric potential between symmetry-inequivalent motifs, $\mu_{\text{B}}(\mathcal{V}_1 - \mathcal{V}_2)\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \boldsymbol{m}$, which explains how finite SS emerges in the absence of SOC and enables a complete classification of momentum dependence and motif connectivity across all 32 point groups. Through illustrative examples, we show that distinct SS behaviors - quadratic (altermagnetic), linear (spin Zeeman effect), and $k$-independent (SS at $\Gamma$) - are specific manifestations of the proposed magnetoelectric relativistic mechanism, each governed by electric quadrupoles, dipoles, or monopoles, respectively. The formalism naturally extends to higher-order multipoles and more complex symmetries. This work establishes a unified framework for SS in magnets and provides a predictive tool for analyzing symmetry-allowed SS in magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) exhibit both high ionic and electronic conductivity to improve the battery performance. In this work, we investigate the mechanism and stability of transport channels in our recently developed MIEC material, amorphous Ti-doped lithium phosphorus sulfide (LPS), using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a 99\% accurate machine-learning force field (MLFF) trained on \textit{ab-initio} MD data. The achieved MLFF helps efficient large-scale MD simulations on LPS with three Ti concentrations (10\%, 20\%, and 30\%) and six temperatures (25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 225$^\mathrm{o}$C) to calculate ionic conductivity, activation energy, Li-ion transport mechanism, and configurational entropy. Results show that ionic conductivities and activation energies are consistent with our recent experimental values. Moreover, Li-ion transport occurs via free-volume diffusion facilitated by the formation of disordered Li-S polyhedra. The enhanced stability of transport channels at 10\% and 20\% Ti doping, compared to 0\% and 30\%, is observed by analyzing the vibrational and configurational entropy of these disordered Li-S polyhedra. Overall, this study highlights the utility of MLFF-based large-scale MD simulations in explaining the transport mechanism and the stability of Li-ion in Ti-doped LPS electrolyte with significant computational efficiency.</p>

            <p>We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the wealth shared in a country or the whole world is described by the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution with two conserved quantities of system wealth and norm or number of agents. This distribution depends on a dimensional parameter being the ratio of system total wealth and its dispersion range determined by highest revenues. At relatively small values of this ratio there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in such physical systems as multimode optical fibers. This leads to a huge fraction of poor households and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of S\&P500 companies at New York Stock Exchange. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.</p>

            <p>Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.</p>

            <p>The typical bound on parameter estimation, known as the standard quantum limit (SQL), can be surpassed by exploiting quantum resources such as entanglement. To estimate the magnetic probe field, we propose a quantum sensor based on a variable-range many-body quantum spin chain with a moderate transverse magnetic field. We report the threefold benefits of employing a long-range system as a quantum sensor. First, sensors with quasi-long-range interactions can always beat the SQL for all values of the coordination number, while a sensor with long-range interactions does not have this ubiquitous quantum advantage. Second, a long-range Hamiltonian outperforms a nearest-neighbor (NN) Hamiltonian in terms of both estimating precision and system-size scaling. Finally, we observe that the system with long-range interactions can go below the SQL in the presence of a high temperature of the initial state, while sensors having NN interactions cannot. Furthermore, a sensor based on the long-range Ising Hamiltonian proves to be robust against impurities in the magnetic field and when the time-inhomogeneous dephasing noise acts during interaction of the probe with the system.</p>

            <p>From benign overfitting in overparameterized models to rich power-law scalings in performance, simple ridge regression displays surprising behaviors sometimes thought to be limited to deep neural networks. This balance of phenomenological richness with analytical tractability makes ridge regression the model system of choice in high-dimensional machine learning. In this paper, we present a unifying perspective on recent results on ridge regression using the basic tools of random matrix theory and free probability, aimed at readers with backgrounds in physics and deep learning. We highlight the fact that statistical fluctuations in empirical covariance matrices can be absorbed into a renormalization of the ridge parameter. This `deterministic equivalence' allows us to obtain analytic formulas for the training and generalization errors in a few lines of algebra by leveraging the properties of the $S$-transform of free probability. From these precise asymptotics, we can easily identify sources of power-law scaling in model performance. In all models, the $S$-transform corresponds to the train-test generalization gap, and yields an analogue of the generalized-cross-validation estimator. Using these techniques, we derive fine-grained bias-variance decompositions for a very general class of random feature models with structured covariates. This allows us to discover a scaling regime for random feature models where the variance due to the features limits performance in the overparameterized setting. We also demonstrate how anisotropic weight structure in random feature models can limit performance and lead to nontrivial exponents for finite-width corrections in the overparameterized setting. Our results extend and provide a unifying perspective on earlier models of neural scaling laws.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antai Tao, Guangzhe Liu, Rongjing Zhang, Junhua Yuan</p>
            <p>In natural environments, solid surfaces present both opportunities and challenges for bacteria. On one hand, they serve as platforms for biofilm formation, crucial for bacterial colonization and resilience in harsh conditions. On the other hand, surfaces can entrap bacteria for extended periods and force them to swim along circular trajectories, constraining their environmental exploration compared to the freedom they experience in the bulk liquid. Here, through systematic single-cell behavioral measurements, phenomenological modeling, and theoretical analysis, we reveal how bacteria strategically navigate these factors. We observe that bacterial surface residence time decreases sharply with increasing tumble bias from zero, transitioning to a plateau at the mean tumble bias of wild-type Escherichia coli (~ 0.25). Furthermore, we find that bacterial surface diffusivity peaks near this mean tumble bias. Considering the phenotypic variation in bacterial tumble bias, which is primarily induced by noise in gene expression, this reflects a strategy for bacterial offspring persistence: In the absence of stimulus cues, some bacteria swiftly escape from the nearby surface in case it lacks nutrients, while others, with longer surface residence times, explore this two-dimensional environment most efficiently to find potential livable sites.</p>

            <p>A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p>

            <p>We perform a comprehensive analysis of the quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo method [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], aimed at identifying the optimal working point of the algorithm. We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental thresholds for computational and erasure errors via the coherent information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Colmenarez, Seyong Kim, Markus Müller</p>
            <p>Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the 2D toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a 50 percent threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of small-size codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. Next, we perform a similar analysis for a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, the lift-connected surface code. We find a 50 percent threshold under erasure errors alone and, for the first time, derive the exact statistical mechanics mappings in the presence of both computational and erasure errors. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds for code classes beyond topological codes under realistic noise, and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.</p>

            <h2>The tricritical Ising CFT and conformal bootstrap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Henriksson</p>
            <p>The tricritical Ising CFT is the IR fixed-point of $\lambda\phi^6$ theory. It can be seen as a one-parameter family of CFTs connecting between an $\varepsilon$-expansion near the upper critical dimension 3 and the exactly solved minimal model in $d=2$. We review what is known about the tricritical Ising CFT, and study it with the numerical conformal bootstrap for various dimensions. Using a mixed system with three external operators $\{\phi\sim\sigma,\phi^2\sim \epsilon,\phi^3\sim\sigma'\}$, we find three-dimensional "bootstrap islands" in $d=2.75$ and $d=2.5$ dimensions consistent with interpolations between the perturbative estimates and the 2d exact values. In $d=2$ and $d=2.25$ the setup is not strong enough to isolate the theory. This paper also contains a survey of the perturbative spectrum and a review of results from the literature.</p>

            <h2>Distribution of singular values in large sample cross-covariance matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arabind Swain, Sean Alexander Ridout, Ilya Nemenman</p>
            <p>For two large matrices ${\mathbf X}$ and ${\mathbf Y}$ with Gaussian i.i.d.\ entries and dimensions $T\times N_X$ and $T\times N_Y$, respectively, we derive the probability distribution of the singular values of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y}$ in different parameter regimes. This extends the Marchenko-Pastur result for the distribution of eigenvalues of empirical sample covariance matrices to singular values of empirical cross-covariances. Our results will help to establish statistical significance of cross-correlations in many data-science applications.</p>

            <h2>Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Calum A. Brown, Katarzyna Macieszczak, Robert L. Jack</p>
            <p>Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.</p>

            <h2>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmud Ashraf Shamim, Eric A F Reinhardt, Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Sergei Gleyzer, Paulo T Araujo</p>
            <p>Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ansätze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.</p>

            <p>Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) micro- and nanoscale light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are promising for next-generation ultrafast optical interconnects and augmented/virtual reality displays. However, scaling to nanoscale dimensions presents significant challenges, including enhanced nonradiative surface recombination, defect and/or dislocation-related emission degradation and nanoscale pixel contact formation. In this work, we demonstrate strain-engineered nanoscale blue LED pixels fabricated via top-down nanostructuring of an all-InGaN quantum well/barrier heterostructure grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on significantly low dislocation-density single-crystal GaN substrates. Sidewall passivation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 enables excellent diode behavior, including a high rectification ratio and extremely low reverse leakage. Monte Carlo analyses suggest almost 100% yield of completely dislocation-free active regions for 450 nm nanopixels. Electroluminescence measurements show bright blue emission with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.46%. Poisson Schrodinger simulations reveal partial strain relaxation in the QW, effectively mitigating the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE). Additionally, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations confirm that the nanoscale geometry enhances light extraction efficiency by over 40% compared to planar designs, independent of substrate materials. These results establish a scalable pathway for dislocation free, high-brightness InGaN microLED arrays suitable for advanced display and photonic systems.</p>

            <h2>Nanoscale imaging of reduced forward bias at V-pits in green-emitting nitride LEDs</h2>

            <p>Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved in devices containing high V-pit densities. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to improved electrical efficiencies (EE). In order to test this proposition, a novel scanning tunneling luminescence microscope (STLM) is used to map the local optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-pits with nanoscale spatial resolution. Using the STLM tip as the hole injector, injection at the lips of V-pits is found to be drastically different from injection on the heterostructure's c-plane. A $\approx$ 3-fold improvement in internal quantum efficiency near V-pits is observed at low injection, and at higher injection a $\approx$ 1.2 V reduction in the forward bias unambiguously confirms the EE hypothesis for hole injection.</p>
