            <h2>Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in a quantum fractal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Biplab Pal</p>
            <p>Fractal geometries exhibit complex structures with scale invariance self-similar pattern over various length scales. An artificially designed quantum fractal geometry embedded in a uniform magnetic flux has been explored in this study. It has been found that due to quantum mechanical effect, such quantum fractal display an exotic electronic property which is reflected in its transport characteristics. Owing to this uniform magnetic flux piercing through each closed-loop building block of the fractal structure, an electron traversing through such a fractal geometry will pick up a nontrivial Aharonov-Bohm phase factor, which will influence its transport through the system. It is shown that, one can completely block the transmission of an electron in this fractal geometry by setting the value of the uniform magnetic flux to half flux quantum. This phenomenon of Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in this quantum fractal geometry has been supported by the computation of the energy spectrum, two-terminal transport and persistent current in its various generations. This result is very robust against disorder and could be useful in designing efficient quantum algorithms using a quantum fractal network.</p>

            <h2>The role of confined water in the emergence of electrostatic strong coupling as revealed by nanoseparated charged lipid layers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swen Helstroffer, Ludovic Gardré, Giovanna Fragneto, Arnaud Hemmerle, Léo Henry, Laurent Joly, Fabrice Thalmann, Claire Loison, Pierre Muller, Thierry Charitat</p>
            <p>This study investigates the interplay between Strong Coupling (SC) attraction and hydration repulsion in nanoconfined water between like-charged phospholipid layers. It challenges the assumption that SC attraction requires multivalent counterions by showing that hydration water can enhance electrostatic interactions. We combine reflectivities with numerical simulations to analyze supported phospholipid layers under different relative humidity and surface charge densities. X-ray fluorescence demonstrates that we can control the valence of the associated counterions. Experimental measurement of the water thickness, combined with precise determination of charged surface positions by numerical simulations, enable us to compare our experiments with a theoretical model. It shows that charge-screening by hydration water induces SC attraction, even at moderate surface charge densities with monovalent counterions. Furthermore, hydration repulsion is stronger for DPPS compared to DPPC. These findings offer insights into the forces that control interactions between phospholipid layers and have important implications for biological and colloidal systems.</p>

            <h2>Electronic origin of the reorganization energy in interfacial electron transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sonal Maroo, Leonardo Coello Escalante, Yizhe Wang, Matthew P. Erodici, Jonathon N. Nessralla, Ayana Tabo, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Ke Xu, David T. Limmer, D. Kwabena Bediako</p>
            <p>The activation free energy of electron transfer (ET) reactions is governed by a crucial parameter: the reorganization energy. In heterogeneous ET at electrified solid-liquid interfaces, it is presumed that only factors in the electrolyte phase are responsible for determining the reorganization energy. Here, we demonstrate the contribution of the electronic density of states (DOS) of the electrode to the reorganization energy. Using van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional crystals, we tune the DOS of graphene and measure its impact on outer-sphere ET. We find the ensuing variation in ET rate arises from modulation in a reorganization energy associated with image potential localization in the electrode, which is dependent on the DOS. This work establishes a fundamental role of the electrode electronic structure in interfacial charge transfer.</p>

            <h2>Qubit based on 0-$π$ Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N. Stefanakis</p>
            <p>We investigate the static properties of 0-$\pi$ Josephson junctions, with particular emphasis on their application in superconducting quantum circuits. Using a theoretical framework based on the sine-Gordon equation, we analyze the phase evolution for 0-$\pi$ junctions under various boundary and excitation conditions. These junctions, characterized by spatially varying phase shifts, offer promising configurations for qubit implementations due to their intrinsic symmetry and potential robustness against decoherence. We explore the energy landscape, quantized levels, and switching dynamics relevant for qubit state manipulation. Additionally, we present models for phase, flux, and charge qubit designs, emphasizing their operational principles and readout mechanisms. This work provides insights into the engineering of Josephson-based qubits and supports their continued development as scalable components for quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Unlocking Photon Magnon Interplay via Saturation Magnetization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sachin Verma, Jiten Mahalik, Abhishek Maurya, Rajeev Singh, Biswanath Bhoi</p>
            <p>Photon magnon hybrid systems present a promising platform for the development of next generation devices in quantum information processing and quantum sensing technologies. In this study, we investigate the control of photon magnon coupling (PMC) strength through systematic variation of the saturation magnetization in a planar hexagonal ring resonator (HRR) integrated with a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film configuration. Using full wave numerical simulations in CST Microwave Studio, we demonstrate that tuning the Ms of the YIG film from 1750 Oe to 900 Oe enables systematic control over the coupling strength across the 127 to 51 MHz range at room temperature. To explain the observed PMC dynamics, we develop a semiclassical analytical model based on electromagnetic theory that accurately reproduces the observed coupling behavior, revealing the key role of spin density in mediating the light matter interaction. The model is further extended to include the effects of variable magnon damping across different Ms values, enabling broader frequency control. These findings establish Ms as a key tuning parameter for tailoring PMC, with direct implications for the design of tunable hybrid systems for reconfigurable quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Soft superconductivity in covalent bismuth dihydride BiH2 under extreme conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianning Guo, Dmitrii V. Semenok, Ivan A. Troyan, Di Zhou, Yulong Wang, Yuzhi Chen, Su Chen, Kexin Zhang, Xinyue Wu, Sven Luther, Toni Helm, Andrey V Sadakov, Alexey S. Usoltsev, Leonid A Morgun, Vladimir M Pudalov, Viktor V Struzhkin, Xiaoli Huang</p>
            <p>Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride, successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase P21m BiH2 exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 70 K among MH2type hydrides apart from H2S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for P21m and C2m BiH2 indicate that the upper critical fields miu0Hc2(0) is 12 to 16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar Tc. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH2, about 1.1 106 m s, which allows to classify BiH2 as a soft molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum Jc(0) is 10 kA mm2), which indicates the presence of two s wave superconducting gaps in BiH2 at 172 to 176 GPa: deltaL(0) is 6.9 1.2 meV and deltaS(0) is 1.5 meV.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity and phase diagram in Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</h2>

            <p>Recent studies have demonstrated ambient pressure superconductivity in compressively strained La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films, yet the phase diagram of heterovalent doping$-$critical for advancing the field$-$remains unexplored. Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</p>

            <h2>Theory of charge-to-spin conversion under quantum confinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alfonso Maiellaro, Francesco Romeo, Mattia Trama, Irene Gaiardoni, Jacopo Settino, Claudio Guarcello, Nicolas Bergeal, Manuel Bibes, Roberta Citro</p>
            <p>The interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in low-dimensional systems is a cornerstone of modern spintronics, where achieving all-electrical control of spin currents is a major goal. Spin-orbit interactions provide a promising mechanism for such control, yet understanding how spin and charge transport emerge from microscopic principles remains a fundamental challenge. Here we develop a spin-dependent scattering matrix approach to describe spin and charge transport in a multiterminal system in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our framework generalizes the Büttiker formalism by offering explicit real-space expressions for spin and charge current densities, along with the corresponding linear response function. It simultaneously captures the effects of quantum confinement, the orbital response to external magnetic fields, and the intrinsic (geometric) properties of the electronic bands, offering a comprehensive description of the spin-charge interconversion mechanisms at play in a Hall bar, in agreement with experiments.</p>

            <h2>Hydrogen Bond Topology Reveals Layering of LDL-like and HDL-like Water at its Liquid/Vapor Interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pal Jedlovszky, Christoph Dellago, Marcello Sega</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-density liquid (HDL) and low-density liquid (LDL) water has been a major success of molecular simulations, yet extending this analysis to interfacial water is challenging due to conventional order parameters assuming local homogeneity. This limitation previously prevented resolving the composition of the surface layer of the liquid/vapour interface. Here, we apply a recently introduced topological order parameter [R. Foffi and F. Sciortino, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 378-386 (2022)] to analyze the composition of the water/vapor interface across a broad temperature range. Our results reveal that LDL-like water dominates the outermost region at all temperatures, while HDL-like water accumulates beneath it, presenting a clear layering roughly below the temperature of maximum density. This structured stratification, previously inaccessible, highlights the power of the topological order parameter in resolving interfacial molecular heterogeneity and provides new insights into the structural properties of water at interfaces.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism, a newly discovered magnetic order, combines zero net magnetization with non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic bands. Its ability to utilize the advantages of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets is highly promising for spintronic applications. Currently, the merge of altermagnetism and weak ferromagnetism in a single material excites significant interest as it provides additional control mechanisms over material properties. However, the role of dimensionality in this interplay is yet to be explored. Here, we study magnetism and electron transport in epitaxial films of the candidate altermagnet GdAlGe ranging from bulklike to a single monolayer. The films exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and negative magnetoresistance. In contrast to altermagnetic GdAlSi, the candidate altermagnet GdAlGe demonstrates an admixture of the ferromagnetic state which contribution increases as the system approaches the 2D limit. The coexistence of the magnetic states induces technologically important intrinsic exchange bias. The present work underpins future studies and applications of nanoscale altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>Renormalization group analysis of a continuous model with self-organized criticality: Effects of randomly moving environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N.V. Antonov, P.I. Kakin, N.M. Lebedev, A.Yu. Luchin</p>
            <p>We study a strongly anisotropic self-organized critical system coupled to an isotropic random fluid environment. The former is described by a continuous (coarse-grained) model due to Hwa and Kardar. The latter is modeled by the Navier--Stokes equation with a random stirring force of a rather general form that includes, in particular, the overall shaking of the system and a non-local part with power-law spectrum $\sim k^{4-d-y}$ that describes, in the limiting case $y \to 4$, a turbulent fluid. The full problem of the two coupled stochastic equations is represented as a field theoretic model which is shown to be multiplicatively renormalizable and logarithmic at $d=4$. Due to the interplay between isotropic and anisotropic interactions, the corresponding renormalization group (RG) equations reveal a rich pattern of possible infrared (large scales, long times) regimes of asymptotic behaviour of various Green's functions. The attractors of the RG equations in the five-dimensional space of coupling parameters include a two-dimensional surface of Gaussian (free) fixed points, a single fixed point that corresponds to the plain advection by the turbulent fluid (the Hwa--Kardar self-interaction is irrelevant) and a one-dimensional curve of fixed points that corresponds to the case where the Hwa--Kardar nonlinearity and the uniform stirring are simultaneously relevant. The character of attractiveness is determined by the exponent $y$ and the dimension of space $d$; the most interesting case $d=3$ and $y \to 4$ is described by the single fixed point. The corresponding critical dimensions of the frequency and the basic fields are found exactly.</p>

            <h2>Disorder-Driven Exceptional Points and Concurrent Topological Phase Transitions in Non-Hermitian Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyu Cheng, Tiantao Qu, Yaqing Yang, Lei Zhang, Jun Chen</p>
            <p>Exceptional point (EP) and topological phase transition (TPT) in non-Hermitian systems have recently garnered significant attention owing to their fundamental importance and potential applications in sensing and topological devices. Beyond the EP induced by non-reciprocal hopping, we show that random disorder can also drive the valence and conduction bands across EPs, even twice in the non-Hermitian regime. Remarkably, a TPT can occur concurrently with an EP as disorder strength increases. These disorder-driven EPs and concurrent TPTs are well captured by effective medium theory. The analysis reveals that their emergence results from the interplay between disorder-induced energy level renormalization and non-reciprocal hopping-induced inter-level coupling, which fundamentally restructures the spectral properties of the system. The phase diagram in the parameter space of non-reciprocal hopping and disorder strength identifies robust EP lines. Interestingly, two EP lines can emerge from the TPT point in the Hermitian limit. As non-reciprocal hopping increases, these lines split, with one aligning the TPT, leading to distinct disorder-induced EPs. Our results uncover a robust, disorder-driven mechanism for generating EPs and concurrent TPTs, offering a new direction for exploring non-Hermitian topological matter.</p>

            <p>The symmetry of Cooper pairs encodes key information about superconductivity and has been widely studied through the temperature dependence of the superfluid weight. However, in systems dominated by quantum geometry, conventional theories miss its essential properties. We study the temperature dependence of the quantum-geometric superfluid weight and classify the relationship to the superconducting symmetry and band structures. The obtained power laws are different from conventional behavior, and unconventional superconductivity in twisted multilayer graphene is discussed. Our findings provide insights into the superconducting symmetry and the pairing mechanism via quantum geometry.</p>

            <p>The strict geometric rules that define aperiodic tilings lead to the unique spectral and transport properties of quasicrystals, but also limit our ability to design them. In this work, we explore the first continuously tunable family of two-dimensional aperiodic tilings in which the underlying real-space geometry becomes a control knob of the wave-function's quantum geometric tensor. The real-space geometry can be used to tune into topological phases occupying an expanded phase space compared to crystals, or into a disorder-driven topological Anderson insulator. The quantum metric can also be tuned continuously, opening new routes towards tunable single- and many-body physics in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Pacheco-Pozo, Igor M. Sokolov, Ralf Metzler, Diego Krapf</p>
            <p>Diffusion in heterogeneous energy and diffusivity landscapes is widespread in biological systems. However, solving the Langevin equation in such environments introduces ambiguity due to the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, which depends on the underlying physics and can take values in the range $0<\alpha<1$. The typical interpretations are Itô ($\alpha=0$), Stratonovich ($\alpha=1/2$), and Hänggi-Klimontovich ($\alpha=1$). Here, we analyse the motion of a particle in an harmonic potential -- modelled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process -- with diffusivity that varies in space. Our focus is on two-phase systems with a discontinuity in environmental properties at $x=0$. We derive the probability density of the particle position for the process, and consider two paradigmatic situations. In the first one, the damping coefficient remains constant, and fluctuation-dissipation relations are not satisfied. In the second one, these relations are enforced, leading to a position-dependent damping coefficient. In both cases, we provide solutions as a function of the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, with particular attention to the Itô, Stratonovich, and Hänggi-Klimontovich interpretations, revealing fundamentally different behaviours, in particular with respect to an interface located at the potential minimum.</p>

By calculating the excited electron distributions based on ab-initio band structure data, we show how this excited electronic spin response in $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits different symmetries which are determined by the nodal planes intrinsic to the bulk g-wave altermagnet. We present a simple procedure to obtain the symmetry of the electronic spin response from the two-dimensional cuts through the three-dimensional band structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Q. Galvão, Clebson Cruz, Antonio Cesar do Prado Rosa Junior, Marcelo A. Moret</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present an application of the variational quantum simulation (VQS) framework to capture finite-temperature open-system dynamics on near-term quantum hardware. By embedding the generalized amplitude-damping channel into the VQS algorithm, we modeled the energy exchange with a thermal bath through its Lindblad representation and thereby simulated realistic dissipative effects. To explore a wide range of activation behaviors, we introduce a nonadditive relaxation-time model using a generalized form of the Arrhenius law, based on the phenomenological parameter q. We compare our method on a driven qubit subject to both static and composite time-dependent fields, comparing population evolution and trace distance errors against exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that (i) VQS accurately maps the effective nonunitary generator under generalized amplitude damping, (ii) smoother drive envelopes induced by nonaddtive parameters suppress high frequency components and yield lower simulation errors, and (iii) the variational manifold exhibits dynamical selectivity, maintaining mapping fidelity even as the exact solution's sensitivity to q increases.

            <h2>Implicit bias produces neural scaling laws in learning curves, from perceptrons to deep networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco D'Amico, Dario Bocchi, Matteo Negri</p>
            <p>Scaling laws in deep learning - empirical power-law relationships linking model performance to resource growth - have emerged as simple yet striking regularities across architectures, datasets, and tasks. These laws are particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training or on the optimal training time given the model size. In this work, we uncover a richer picture by analyzing the entire training dynamics through the lens of spectral complexity norms. We identify two novel dynamical scaling laws that govern how performance evolves during training. These laws together recover the well-known test error scaling at convergence, offering a mechanistic explanation of generalization emergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide analytical support using a solvable model: a single-layer perceptron trained with binary cross-entropy. In this setting, we show that the growth of spectral complexity driven by the implicit bias mirrors the generalization behavior observed at fixed norm, allowing us to connect the performance dynamics to classical learning rules in the perceptron.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Xin Wu, Jin-Fu Chen, H. T. Quan</p>
            <p>Hysteresis and metastable states are typical features associated with ergodicity breaking in the first-order phase transition. We explore the scaling relations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in finite-time first-order phase transitions. Using the Curie-Weiss model as an example, for large systems we find the excess work scales as $v^{2/3}$ when the magnetic field is quenched at a finite rate $v$ across the phase transition. We further reveal a crossover in the scaling of the excess work from $v^{2/3}$ to $v$ when downsizing the system. Our study elucidates the interplay between the finite-time dynamics and the finite-size effect, which leads to different scaling behaviors of the excess work with or without ergodicity breaking.</p>

            <h2>Intertwined superconductivity and orbital selectivity in a three-orbital Hubbard model for the iron pnictides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vito Marino, Alberto Scazzola, Federico Becca, Massimo Capone, Luca F. Tocchio</p>
            <p>We study a three-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model relevant for iron-based superconductors using variational wave functions explicitly including spatial correlations and electron pairing. We span the nonmagnetic sector from filling $n=4$, which is representative of undoped iron-based superconductors, to $n=3$, where a Mott insulating state with each orbital at half filling is found. In the strong-coupling regime, when the electron density is increased, we find a spontaneous differentiation between the occupation of $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, leading to an orbital-selective state with a nematic character that becomes stronger at increasing density. One of these orbitals stays half-filled for all densities while the other one hosts (together with the $d_{xy}$ orbital) the excess of electron density. Most importantly, in this regime long-range pairing correlations appear in the orbital with the largest occupation. Our results highlight a strong link between orbital-selective correlations, nematicity, and superconductivity, which requires the presence of a significant Hund's coupling.</p>

            <p>Understanding the chemical state of individual ions in solutions is crucial for advancing knowledge of complex chemical systems. However, analyzing systems at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a significant challenge. We present a strategy that leverages the optical emission properties of point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as sensitive ion detectors. The interaction of optically active h-BN defects with ions in solution leads to distinct spectral shifts, enabling precise visualization and analyzing of individual ions. Using Li+ ions in organic electrolytes as a model, we observed spectral shifts exceeding 10 nm upon ion addition. Application of an external electric field further enhanced these shifts to over 40 nm, enabling real-time monitoring of electrical field induced local perturbations of Li+ ions. Following this approach, we showed that each individual single point defect can be used to spectroscopically distinguish ions of varying charges (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+) based on their local electric fields, each producing a distinct spectral shift. This platform allows direct visualization of ions and their chemical states in liquid environments, providing insights into subtle interfacial changes at the single-ion level, with measurable spectral shifts detectable at millisecond temporal resolution and at concentrations down to the millimolar range. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids that include battery technology and environmental science.</p>

            <h2>Characterization of higher-order topological superconductors using Bott indices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun-Jiang Luo, Jia-Zheng Li, Meng Xiao, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>The abundance of bulk and boundary topologies in higher-order topological phases offer remarkable tunability and diversity to boundary states but also pose a challenge to their unified topological characterization. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to characterize time-reversal invariant topological superconductors hosting Majorana Kramers pairs (MKP) of corner states by using a series of spin Bott indices, which capture both bulk and boundary states topology. The developed invariants can characterize MKP in arbitrarily shaped systems and all distinct spatial distribution patterns of MKP. As an illustrative example, we apply our theory to analyze the Kane-Mele model with sublattice-dependent superconducting pairing potentials. In this representative model, both intrinsic and extrinsic higher-order topological superconductors can be realized and various patterns of MKP can be engineered through edge cleavage. Despite their high sensitivity to boundary terminations, MKP can be faithfully characterized by the proposed topological this http URL further demonstrate the characterization of higher-order topological superconductors in the BDI symmetry class using Bott indices without resolving the spin degree of freedom.</p>

            <h2>Bethe-ansatz diagonalization of steady state of boundary driven integrable spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladislav Popkov, Xin Zhang, Carlo Presilla, Tomaz Prosen</p>
            <p>We find that the density operator of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of XXZ spin chain with strong ``sink and source" boundary dissipation, can be described in terms of quasiparticles, with renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. The spectrum of the NESS is then fully accounted for by Bethe ansatz equations for an associated coherent system. The dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, which strongly modifies the NESS spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model. In particular, this leads to a dissipation-assisted entropy reduction, due to the suppression -- in the NESS spectrum -- of plain wave-type Bethe states in favor of Bethe states localized at the boundaries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Zhi Chou, Jihang Zhu, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of \textit{Fermi surface nesting}, we show that superconductivity can emerge near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the $p+ip$, $h+ih$, and the nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in {a narrow stripe shape of superconducting region}, consistent with experimental findings. We point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation with a dominant $p+ip$ pairing. The possibility of realizing intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in other rhombohedral graphene systems is also discussed.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic resetting prevails over sharp restart for broad target distributions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin R. Evans, Somrita Ray</p>
            <p>Resetting has been shown to reduce the completion time for a stochastic process, such as the first passage time for a diffusive searcher to find a target. The time between two consecutive resetting events is drawn from a waiting time distribution $\psi(t)$, which defines the resetting protocol. Previously, it has been shown that deterministic resetting process with a constant time period, referred to as sharp restart, can minimize the mean first passage time to a fixed target. Here we consider the more realistic problem of a target positioned at a random distance $R$ from the resetting site, selected from a given target distribution $P_T(R)$. We introduce the notion of a conjugate target distribution to a given waiting time distribution. The conjugate target distribution, $P_T^*(R)$, is that $P_T(R)$ for which $\psi(t)$ extremizes the mean time to locate the target. In the case of diffusion we derive an explicit expression for $P^*_T(R)$ conjugate to a given $\psi(t)$ which holds in arbitrary spatial dimension. Our results show that stochastic resetting prevails over sharp restart for target distributions with exponential or heavier tails.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan C. Petit, Saswati Ganguly, Matthias Sperl</p>
            <p>We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same distance from jamming density, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</p>

            <p>The fate of the Fermi surface in bulk electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ remains elusive, as does the origin and extension of its pseudogap phase. Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. We find that the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, and thus beyond the sharp increase in Hall carrier density to $\simeq 1+x$ recently observed above $x^{*}=0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1593 (2024)]. This suggests that doped iridates host a unique phase of matter in which a large Hall density coexists with an anisotropic pseudogap, breaking up the Fermi surface into disconnected arcs. The temperature boundary of the pseudogap is $T^{*}\simeq 200$ K for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates and to the energy scale of short range antiferromagnetic correlations in cuprates and iridates.</p>

            <p>We report on the experimental observation of classical Brownian motion in momentum space by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of Rubidium atoms prepared in a hexagonal optical lattice. Upon suddenly increasing the effective atomic mass, the BEC as a whole behaves as a classical rigid body with its center-of-mass receiving random momentum kicks by a Langevin force arising from atom loss and interactions with the surrounding thermal cloud. Physically, this amounts to selective heating of the BEC center-of-mass degree of freedom by a sudden quench, while with regard to the relative coordinates, the BEC is stablized by repulsive atomic interactions, and its internal dynamics is suppressed by forced evaporative cooling induced by atom loss. A phenomenological theory is developed that well explains the experimental data quantitatively.</p>

            <h2>Heat Transport in Ionic Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cillian Cockrell, Aleksandra Dragović</p>
            <p>Heat transfer in liquids is a very challenging problem as it combines the competing effect of high frequency oscillations, which dominate liquid heat capacity, and diffusive motion, which enables transport macroscopic flow. This issue is compounded by the relatively junior state of dynamical theories of liquid thermodynamics. Nevertheless, molten salts are playing an increasingly important role in industrial and energy applications and there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms behind their irreversible transport processes. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the heat transport of three different molten salts: LiCl, KCl, and the eutectic point of their mixture. While all simulations consider the properties of the liquid within the frame of its centre of mass, we calculate different susceptibilities which implicitly include and explicitly exclude the heat carried by partial mass currents within this frame. We find that, while the heat advected by partial mass currents in the mixture increases with increasing temperature, the heat transferred by collective vibrational motion (phonons) decreases with increasing temperature. This causes a maximum in the heat conductance with temperature in the mixtures only - in pure salts each contribution decreases monotonically with temperature. We attribute this anomaly to the extra freedom afforded to ionic motion in mixtures - in pure salts the motion of cations and anions is bound due to conservation of linear momentum. In mixtures, a coherent but diffusive collective motion is enabled by the release of Li ions from this condition by the introduction of a third species. We tentatively ascribe this coherent collective motion to the ``diffusive" phonons that have been used to explain a similar anomaly in the thermal conductivity of solids.</p>

            <h2>Exponential suppression of the topological gap in self-consistent intrinsic Majorana nanowires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Lobo, Elsa Prada, Pablo San-Jose</p>
            <p>Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave gap is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeema field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</p>

            <h2>Trypanosoma brucei moving in microchannels and through constrictions</h2>

            <p>Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a single-celled parasite and natural microswimmer, is responsible for fatal sleeping sickness in infected mammals, including humans. Understanding how T. brucei interacts with fluid environments and navigates through confining spaces is crucial not only for medical and clinical applications but also for a fundamental understanding of how life organizes in a confined microscopic world. Using a hybrid multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD)--molecular dynamics (MD) approach, we present our investigations on the locomotion of an in silico T. brucei in three types of fluid environments: bulk fluid, straight cylindrical microchannels, and microchannels with constrictions. We observe that the helical swimming trajectory of the in silico T. brucei becomes rectified in straight cylindrical channels compared to bulk fluid. The swimming speed for different channel widths is governed by the diameter of the helical trajectory. The speed first slightly increases as the channel narrows and then decreases when the helix diameter is compressed. An optimal swimming speed is achieved, when the channel width is approximately twice the bulk helix diameter. It results from an interplay of the trypanosome's hydrodynamic interactions with the cylindrical channel walls and the high deformability of the parasite. In microchannels with constrictions, the motions of the anterior and posterior ends, the end-to-end distance, and the log-rolling motion of the cell body are characterized and show salient differences compared to the straight-channel case. Depending on the constriction length and width, we observe characteristic slip, stuck, and stuck-slip motions of the model T. brucei within the constriction. Our findings may provide some mechanical insights into how T. brucei moves through blood vessels and tissues, and across the blood-brain barrier.</p>

This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.</p>

            <p>Ferroelectric polarization switching in electrically controlled van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) causes atomic migration, compromising device stability and fatigue resistance. Here we propose a fully magnetically controlled vdW-MFTJ based on a \(\mathrm{CrBr_3/MnPSe_3/CrBr_3}\) vertical heterostructure, which achieves ferroelectric polarization reversal without relying on atomic migration driven by inversion symmetry breaking. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Simulations of Three-dimensional Nematic Guidance of Microswimmers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyang Mou, Yuan Li, Zhihong You, Rui Zhang</p>
            <p>It has been shown that an anisotropic liquid crystalline (LC) environment can be used to guide the self-propulsion dynamics of dispersed microswimmers, such as bacteria. This type of composite system is named "living nematic" (LN). In the dilute limit, bacteria are found to mainly follow the local director field. Beyond the dilute limit, however, they exhibit novel dynamical behaviors, from swirling around a spiral +1 defect pattern to forming undulating waves, and to active turbulence. Our current knowledge of how these different behaviors emerge at different population densities remains limited. Here we develop a hybrid method to simulate the dynamics of microswimmers dispersed in a nematic LC. Specifically, we model the microswimmers using active Brownian dynamics method, which is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of nematic LCs to describe the evolution of the flow field and the LC structure. Our method is validated by comparing to existing quasi-two-dimensional (2D) experiments, including undulated swirling around a spiral pattern and stabilized undulated jets on a periodic C-pattern. We further extend our method to three-dimensional (3D) systems by examining loop-defect dynamics. We find that the morphodynamics and destiny of a loop defect not only depend on the activity (self-propulsion velocity), effective size, and the initial distribution of the swimmers, but also rely on its winding profile. Specifically, +1/2 wedge and radial twist winding can dictate the dynamics of loop defects. By varying the characteristic reversal time, we predict that microswimmers not necessarily accumulate in splay regions. Taken together, our hybrid method provides a faithful tool to explain and guide the experiments of LNs in both 2D and 3D, sheds light on the interplay between microswimmer distribution and defect dynamics, and unravels the design principles of using LCs to control active matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjun Zhao, Yuri Fukaya, Pablo Burset, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu</p>
            <p>We investigate de Gennes-Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. Even though these states are associated to long junctions, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet in a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction forms de Gennes-Saint-James states in a short junction due to an enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors. As a result, the zero-bias conductance peak vanishes and pronounced resonance spikes emerge in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the $d_{xy}$-altermagnet only features de Gennes-Saint-James states in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I(\varphi)$ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi$ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.</p>

            <p>Here we demonstrate the floating zone crystal growth of the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Historically, the growth of iridates from a ternary melt has been precluded by the extreme vapor pressure of the metal oxide species and the difficulty of maintaining the correct oxidation state of Ir at high temperatures. Here, we show that the application of a high-pressure oxygen growth environment stabilizes the Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ phase, leading to the first demonstration of cm$^{3}$-scale crystals. In contrast to the conventional SrCl$_2$ flux growth method, where poor control over disorder leads to strong sample dependence, the high-pressure floating zone growth enables active control over the homogeneity of the melt. Crystals grown via this technique possess qualitatively similar properties to those grown via flux, with a relatively sharp onset of antiferromagnetic order observed in temperature-dependent magnetization. Further, we demonstrate that by tuning the mixing rate of the melt, we are able to grow natively hole-doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-y}$O$_4$, which exhibits a strongly modified magnetic and electronic response.</p>

            <h2>Ancilla theory of twisted bilayer graphene I: topological Mott localization and pseudogap metal in twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Yu Zhao, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>The recent experimental studies of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) raise a fundamental question: how do we understand Mott localization in a topological band? In this work, we offer a new perspective of Mott physics, which can be generalized to TBG directly in momentum space. In our theory, the Mott gap is understood as from an exciton-like hybridization $\Phi(\mathbf k) c^\dagger(\mathbf k)\psi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical electron $c$ and an ancilla fermion $\psi$. In the conventional Mott insulator of trivial band, the hybridization is $s$-wave with $\Phi(\mathbf k)=\frac{U}{2}$, where $U$ is the on-site Hubbard interaction. On the other hand, the band topology in TBG enforces a topological Mott hybridization with $\Phi(\mathbf k)\sim k_x \pm i k_y$ in a small region around $\mathbf{k}=0$. We dub this new Mott state as topological Mott localization because of the $p\pm ip$ order parameter analogous to the topological superconductor. At $\nu=0$, we find a topological Mott semimetal with a low energy effective theory resembling that of the untwisted bilayer graphene. For $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we show transitions from correlated insulators to Mott semimetals at smaller $U$. In the most intriguing density region $\nu=-2-x$, we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Interestingly, the quasiparticle is primarily formed by ancilla fermion, which we interpret as a composite fermion formed by a hole bound to a particle-hole pair. Our theory offers a unified language to describe the Mott localization in both trivial and topological bands in momentum space, and we anticipate applications in other moiré systems with topological Wannier obstruction, such as the twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayer.</p>

            <h2>Magnon damping and mode softening in quantum double-exchange ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Moreo, E. Dagotto, G. Alvarez, T. Tohyama, M. Mierzejewski, J. Herbrych</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic excitations and electronic properties of fully quantum double-exchange ferromagnets, i.e., systems where ferromagnetic ordering emerges from the competition between spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom, but without the canonical approximation of using classical localized spins. Specifically, we investigate spin excitations within the Kondo lattice-like model, as well as a two-orbital Hubbard Hamiltonian in proximity to the orbital-selective Mott phase. Computational analysis of the magnon dispersion, damping, and spectral weight within these models reveals unexpected phenomena, such as magnon mode softening and the anomalous decoherence of magnetic excitations as observed in earlier experimental efforts, but explained here without the use of the phononic degrees of freedom. We show that these effects are intrinsically linked to incoherent spectral features near the Fermi level, which arise due to the quantum nature of the local (on-site) triplets. This incoherent spectrum leads to a Stoner-like continuum on which spin excitations scatter, governing magnon lifetime and strongly influencing the dynamical spin structure factor. Our study explores the transition from coherent to incoherent magnon spectra by varying the electron density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the localized spin mitigates decoherence by suppressing the incoherent spectral contributions near the Fermi level. We also discuss the effective $J_1$-$J_2$ spin Hamiltonian, which can accurately describe the large doping region characterized by the magnon-mode softening. Finally, we show that this behavior is also present in multiorbital models with partially filled orbitals, namely, in systems without localized spin moments, provided that the model is in a strong coupling regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gökhan Öztarhan, Paweł Potasz, A. D. Güçlü</p>
            <p>We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the generalized Hubbard model. We analyze models of armchair hexagonal geometries nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling. This form of itinerant magnetism predicted rigorously for Hubbard model remained unascertained in large scale realistic systems. We demonstrate that Coulomb scattering terms play a crucial role in stabilizing Nagaoka ferromagnetism, enabling the observation of the phase transition for system parameters near $U/t \approx 60$.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Instabilities with Quantum Geometry in Flat Band Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Xin Zhang, Wen O. Wang, Leon Balents, Lucile Savary</p>
            <p>The absence of a well-defined Fermi surface in flat-band systems challenges the conventional understanding of instabilities toward Landau order based on nesting. We investigate the existence of an intrinsic nesting structure encoded in the band geometry (i.e. the wavefunctions of the flat band(s)), which leads to a maximal susceptibility at the mean-field level and thus determines the instability towards ordered phases. More generally, we show that for a given band structure and observable, we can define two vector fields: one which corresponds to the Bloch vector of the projection operator onto the manifold of flat bands, and another which is "dressed" by the observable. The overlap between the two vector fields, possibly shifted by a momentum vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$, fully determines the mean field susceptibility of the corresponding order parameter. When the overlap is maximized, so is the susceptibility, and this geometrically corresponds to "perfect nesting" of the band structure. In that case, we show that the correlation length of this order parameter, even for $\boldsymbol{Q}\neq \boldsymbol{0}$, is entirely characterized by a generalized quantum metric in an intuitive manner, and is therefore lower-bounded in topologically non-trivial bands. As an example, we demonstrate hidden nesting for staggered antiferromagnetic spin order in an exactly flat-band model, which is notably different from the general intuition that flat bands are closely associated with ferromagnetism. We check the actual emergence of this long-range order using the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like state (pairing with non-zero center of mass momentum) can arise in flat bands upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, even if Zeeman splitting is absent.</p>

The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial.

            <p>The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets has opened new avenues for exploring topological spin textures and their applications in next-generation spintronics. Among these materials, Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT) emerges as a model system due to its room-temperature skyrmion phases, which are stabilized by strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, the atomistic origins of DMI in centrosymmetric vdW lattices remain elusive. Here, we report a spontaneous DMI enhancement mechanism driven by FC in FGaT and its analog Fe3GeTe2 (FGeT). Combining Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we have observed the irreversible precipitation of FeTe2 in annealed FGaT. The resulting FeTe2/FGaT heterostructure is considered to break the symmetry and significantly enhance the DMI. Furthermore, similar phenomenon has been observed in the family ferromagnetic material FGeT as well. Additionally, the precipitation of FeTe2 varies significantly with different thicknesses of FGaT, aligning closely with the reported behavior of skyrmions. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms behind the origin of the DMI in ternary tellurides, paving the way for advanced spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Strain-Gradient and Curvature-Induced Changes in Domain Morphology of BaTiO3 Nanorods: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</h2>

            <p>We investigate the impact of OH- ions incorporation on the lattice strain and spontaneous polarization of BaTiO3 nanorods synthesized under different conditions. It was confirmed that the lattice strain depends directly on Ba supersaturation, with higher supersaturation leading to an increase in the lattice strain. However, it was shown that crystal growth and observed lattice distortion are not primarily influenced by external strain; rather, OH- ions incorporation plays a key role in generating internal chemical strains and driving these processes. By using the less reactive TiO2 precursor instead of TiOCl2 and controlling Ba supersaturation, the slower nucleation rate enables more effective regulation of OH- ions incorporation and crystal growth. This in turn effects both particle size and lattice distortion, leading to c/a ratio of 1.013 - 1.014. The incorporation of OH- ions induces lattice elongation along the c-axis, contributing to anisotropic growth, increasing of the rod diameter and their growth-induced bending. However, the possibility of the curvature-induced changes in domain morphology of BaTiO3 nanorods remains almost unexplored. To study the possibility, we perform analytical calculations and finite element modeling, which provide insights into the curvature-induced changes in the strain-gradient, polarization distribution, and domain morphology in BaTiO3 nanorods. Theoretical results reveal the appearance of the domain stripes in BaTiO3 nanorod when the curvature exceeds a critical angle. The physical origin of the domain stripes emergence is the tendency to minimize its elastic energy of the nanorod by the domain splitting. These findings suggest that BaTiO3 nanorods, with curvature-controllable amount of domain stripes, could serve as flexible race-track memory elements for flexo-tronics and domain-wall electronics.</p>

            <p>``Do Carroll particles move?'' The answer depends on the characteristics of the particle such as its mass, spin, electric charge, and magnetic moment. A massive Carroll particle (closely related to fractons) does not move; its immobility follows from Carroll boost symmetry which implies dipole conservation, but not conversely. A massless Carroll particle may propagate by following the Hall law, consistently with the partial breaking of the Carroll boost symmetry. The framework is extended to Carroll field theory. In $d=2$ space dimensions, the Carroll group has a two-fold central extension which allows us to generalize the dynamics to massive and massless particles, including anyons. The anyonic spin and magnetic moment combine with the doubly-extended structure parameterized by two Casimir invariants interpreted as intrinsic magnetization and non-commutativity parameter. The extended Carroll particle subjected to an electromagnetic background field moves following a generalized Hall law which includes a Zeeman force. This theory is illustrated by massless, uncharged anyons with doubly-centrally extended structure we call exotic photons, which move on the horizon of a Black Hole, giving rise to an anyonic spin-Hall Effect.</p>

            <h2>Generalized $α$-Observational Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivam Sinha, Nripendra Majumbdar, S. Aravinda</p>
            <p>Traditional measures of entropy, like the Von Neumann entropy, while fundamental in quantum information theory, are insufficient when interpreted as thermodynamic entropy due to their invariance under unitary transformations, which contradicts observed entropy increases in isolated systems. Recognizing this limitations of existing measures for thermodynamic entropy, recent research has focused on observational entropy (OE) as a promising alternative, offering practical applicability and theoretical insights. In this work, we extend the scope of observational entropy by generalizing it to a parameterized version called $\alpha$-Observational entropy ($\alpha$-OE). $\alpha$-OE is expressed in terms of the Petz-Rényi relative entropy between the states on which a quantum-to-classical channel is applied. The $\alpha$-OE reduces to OE under $\alpha\rightarrow 1$. We prove various properties of the $\alpha$-OE, which are the generalization of the properties of OE, including the monotonically increasing of $\alpha$-OE as a function of refinement of coarse-graining. We further explore the role of $\alpha$-OE in thermodynamic contexts, particularly for the entropy production in open and closed quantum systems and its relation with the Helmholtz free energy.</p>

            <p>Bridging the gap between the practical performance of deep learning and its theoretical foundations often involves analyzing neural networks through stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Expanding on previous research that focused on modeling structured inputs under a simple Gaussian setting, we analyze the behavior of a deep learning system trained on inputs modeled as Gaussian mixtures to better simulate more general structured inputs. Through empirical analysis and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that under certain standardization schemes, the deep learning model converges toward Gaussian setting behavior, even when the input data follow more complex or real-world distributions. This finding exhibits a form of universality in which diverse structured distributions yield results consistent with Gaussian assumptions, which can support the theoretical understanding of deep learning models.</p>

            <p>Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity fields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological bands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.</p>

            <p>The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating many-body stabilizer Rényi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Ming Ding, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan</p>
            <p>We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling \emph{reduced Pauli strings} within a \emph{reduced configuration space}, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. We first isolate the free energy part in $2$-SRE, which is a trivial term. Notably, at quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the \emph{characteristic function} contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, analyzing the volume-law correction to SRE reveals a discontinuity tied to criticalities, suggesting that it is more informative than the full-state magic. For conformal critical points, we claim it could reflect nonlocal magic residing in correlations. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.</p>

            <p>Topological Floquet energy pumps -- which use periodic driving to create a topologically protected quantized energy current -- have been proposed and studied theoretically, but have never been observed directly. Previous work proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly-driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to $T_1$, which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.</p>

            <p>We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and generalized unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations, for which computing the off-diagonal matrix elements is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete for any polynomial depth. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</p>

The cavity has a length of $19.786$mm, a finesse of $2.35\times 10^4$ and operates $214\mu\text{m}$ away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</p>

Linearly polarized condensates exhibit a combined effect of polariton bunching and two-polariton interference.

            <p>We analyze the universality classes of phase transitions in a variety of nonlinear voter models. By mapping several models with symmetric absorbing states onto a canonical model introduced in previous studies, we confirm that they exhibit a Generalized Voter (GV) transition. We then propose a canonical mean-field model that extends the original formulation by incorporating a noise term that eliminates the absorbing states. This generalization gives rise to a phase diagram featuring two distinct types of phase transitions: a continuous Ising transition and a discontinuous transition we call Modified Generalized Voter (MGV). These two transition lines converge at a tricritical point. We map diverse noisy nonlinear voter models onto this extended canonical form. Using finite-size scaling techniques above and below the upper critical dimension, we show that the continuous transition of these models belongs to the Ising universality class in their respective dimensionality. We also find universal behavior at the tricitical point. Our results provide a unifying framework for classifying phase transitions in stochastic models of opinion dynamics with both nonlinearity and noise.</p>

            <h2>Charge-loop current order and Z3 nematicity mediated by bond-order fluctuations in kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A=Cs,Rb,K)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>Recent experiments on geometrically frustrated kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs) have revealed the emergence of the charge loop current (cLC) order near the bond order (BO) phase. However, the origin of the cLC and its relation to other phases have been uncovered. Here, we discover a novel mechanism of the cLC state, by focusing on the BO phase common in kagome metals. The BO fluctuations in metals mediate the odd-parity particle-hole condensation, which drives the topological charge-current. This state is further stabilized by the finite electron-phonon coupling and the off-site Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the predicted cLC+BO phase gives rise to the Z3-nematic state in addition to the giant anomalous Hall effect. The present theory predicts the close relationship between the cLC, the BO, and the nematicity, which is significant to understand the cascade of quantum electron states in kagome metals.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Lifshitz points in an altermagnetic metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Hu, Xia-Ji Liu</p>
            <p>We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic Compression of Free Fermionic Quantum Circuits: Particle Creation, Arbitrary Lattices and Controlled Evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Efekan Kökcü, Daan Camps, Lindsay Bassman Oftelie, Wibe A. de Jong, Roel Van Beeumen, A. F. Kemper</p>
            <p>Recently we developed a local and constructive algorithm based on Lie algebraic methods for compressing Trotterized evolution under Hamiltonians that can be mapped to free fermions. The compression algorithm yields a circuit which scales linearly in the number of qubits, has a depth independent of evolution time and compresses time-dependent Hamiltonians. The algorithm is limited to simple nearest-neighbor spin interactions and fermionic hopping. In this work, we extend our methods to compress evolution with long-range fermionic hopping, thereby enabling the embedding of arbitrary lattices onto a chain of qubits for fermion models. Moreover, we show that controlled time evolution, as well as fermion creation and annihilation operators can also be compressed. We demonstrate our results by adiabatically preparing the ground state for a half-filled fermionic chain, simulating a $4 \times 4$ tight binding model on ibmq washington, and calculating the topological Zak phase on a Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. With these new developments, our results enable the simulation of a wider range of models of interest and the efficient compression of subcircuits.</p>

            <h2>Folded State Dynamics -- A Geometric and Deterministic Origin of Irreversibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick BarAvi</p>
            <p>The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central challenge in statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are limited to dilute gases and short timescales. We introduce Folded State Dynamics (FSD), a framework in which irreversibility arises from the geometric structure of phase space in systems with coupled rotational and translational degrees of freedom. In contrast to conventional models with unfolded, weakly coupled modes, FSD exhibits phase space folding, where deterministic coupling induces instability and chaotic mixing. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible phase space volume, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) occupy measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times Trec, resolving Loschmidt's and Zermelo's objections without coarse-graining or fine-tuning. FSD is further extended to include charged systems (cFSD), where electromagnetic interactions continuously drive phase space folding. FSD thus offers a deterministic and testable mechanism for irreversibility, with implications ranging from confined colloids to the cosmological arrow of time</p>

            <h2>Quantum Hall Effect without Chern Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Michen, Jan Carl Budich</p>
            <p>The quantum Hall effect was originally observed in a two-dimensional electron gas forming Landau levels when exposed to a strong perpendicular magnetic field, and has later been generalized to Chern insulators without net magnetization. Here, further extending the realm of the quantum Hall effect, we report on the robust occurrence of an integer quantized transverse conductance at the onset of disorder in a microscopic lattice model all bands of which are topologically trivial (zero Chern number). We attribute this remarkable phenomenon to the energetic separation of substantial but non-quantized Berry fluxes within the topologically trivial bands. Adding a random disorder potential then nudges the system into a stable quantum Hall phase from an extended critical regime of the clean system obtained by placing the Fermi energy within a broad window in either of the trivial bands. Our results are corroborated by extensive numerical transport simulations as well as the analysis of several complementary topological markers.</p>

            <h2>Towards Atomic-Scale Control over Structural Modulations in Quasi-1D Chalcogenides for Colossal Optical Anisotropy</h2>

            <p>Optically anisotropic materials are sought after for tailoring the polarization of light. Recently, colossal optical anisotropy was reported in a quasi-one-dimensional chalcogenide, Sr1.125TiS3. Compared to SrTiS3, the excess Sr in Sr1.125TiS3 leads to periodic structural modulations and introduces additional electrons that undergo charge ordering on select Ti atoms to form a highly polarizable cloud oriented along the c-axis, hence, resulting in the colossolal optical anisotropy. Here, further enhancement of the colossal optical anisotropy to 2.5 in Sr1.143TiS3 is reported through control over the periodicity of the atomic-scale modulations. The role of structural modulations in tuning the optical properties in a series of SrxTiS3 compounds has been investigated using DFT calculations. The structural modulations arise from various stacking sequences of face-sharing TiS6 octahedra and twist-distorted trigonal prisms, and are found to be thermodynamically stable for x larger than 1 but smaller than 1.5. As x increases, an indirect-to-direct band gap transition is predicted for x equal to and larger than 1.143 along with an increased occupancy of Ti-dz2 states. Together, these two factors result in a theoretically predicted maximum birefriengence of 2.5 for Sr1.143TiS3. Single crystals of Sr1.143TiS3 were grown using a molten-salt flux method. Atomic-scale observations using scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm the feasibility of synthesizing SrxTiS3 with varied modulation periodicities. Overall, these findings demonstrate compositonal tunability of optical properties in SrxTiS3 compounds, and potentially in other hexagonal perovskites having structural modulations.</p>

            <p>Introducing symmetry breaking in materials enables the emergence of functionalities. This can be microscopically and macroscopically driven by applying external stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field, temperature, and chemical modification. For instance, non-zero net dipole moments are formed in a material with the presence of local charged defects or their clusters, which can alter the crystal structure, charge states, and electrostatic potential across the material. Here, we demonstrate a conceptual approach to defects-mediated symmetry breaking that allows for built-in polarization in a centrosymmetric oxide, $\mathrm{Gd}_x\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{2-\delta}$ (CGO) films, via creating a macroscopic charge asymmetry. Our results show that switchable and enduring polarization in CGO films is governed by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies. This leads to notable and persistent pyroelectric effects with coefficient of approximately 180 $\mu\mathrm{C}\cdot\mathrm{m}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Our findings highlight the potential to develop high-performance, sustainable, environmentally friendly polar film materials by manipulating ionic defects from their centrosymmetric ground states. This approach provides new opportunities to expand polar materials in current and future energy and electronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Luo, Asier Zabalo, Guodong Ren, Gwan-Yeong Jung, Massimiliano Stengel, Rohan Mishra, Jayakanth Ravichandran, Laurent Bellaiche</p>
            <p>Gyrotropic effects, including natural optical activity (NOA) and the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NAHE), are crucial for advancing optical and transport devices. We explore these effects in the BaTiS3 system, a quasi-one-dimensional crystal that exhibits giant optical anisotropy. (Niu et al. Nat. Photonics 12, 392 (2018); Zhao et al. Chem. Mater. 34, 5680 (2022)). In the P63cm phase which is stable under room temperature, we predict two distinct strain-induced phase transitions: a symmetry-lowering transition from the P63cm to P63 phase under tensile strain, which enhances NOA and enables optical rotation; and an isostructural insulator-to-polar Weyl semimetal (WSM) transition under compressive strain, which activates the NAHE and exhibits a strain-induced sign reversal. The low-temperature P21 phase also transforms into a P212121 phase under enough compressive strains with such phase transition exhibiting a large NOA. All these results highlight BaTiS3 as a viable candidate for novel ferroelectrics, optical and transport devices with strain enhanced or activated gyrotropic properties.</p>

            <p>Optically active quantum dot molecules (QDMs) can host multi-spin quantum states with the potential for the deterministic generation of photonic graph states with tailored entanglement structures. Their usefulness for the generation of such non-classical states of light is determined by orbital and spin decoherence mechanisms, particularly phonon-mediated processes dominant at energy scales up to a few millielectronvolts. Here, we directly measure the spectral function of orbital phonon relaxation in a QDM and benchmark our findings against microscopic kp theory. Our results reveal phonon-mediated relaxation rates exhibiting pronounced resonances and anti-resonances, with rates ranging from several ten ns$^{-1}$ to tens of $\mu$s$^{-1}$. Comparison with a kinetic model reveals the voltage (energy) dependent phonon coupling strength and fully explains the interplay between phonon-assisted relaxation and radiative recombination. These anti-resonances can be leveraged to increase the lifetime of energetically unfavorable charge configurations needed for realizing efficient spin-photon interfaces and multi-dimensional cluster states.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-Mediated Electron-Electron Interactions: Renormalizing Dirac States in Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Liu, Francesco Troisi, Hannes Hübener, Simone Latini, Angel Rubio</p>
            <p>Embedding materials in optical cavities has emerged as a strategy for tuning material properties. Accurate simulations of electrons in materials interacting with quantum photon fluctuations of a cavity are crucial for understanding and predicting cavity-induced phenomena. In this article, we develop a non-perturbative quantum electrodynamical approach based on a photon-free self-consistent Hartree-Fock framework to model the coupling between electrons and cavity photons in crystalline materials. We apply this theoretical approach to investigate graphene coupled to the vacuum field fluctuations of cavity photon modes with different types of polarizations. The cavity photons introduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, originating from the quantum nature of light, that lead to significant renormalization of the Dirac bands. In contrast to the case of graphene coupled to a classical circularly polarized light field, where a topological Dirac gap emerges, the nonlocal interactions induced by a quantum linearly polarized photon mode give rise to the formation of flat bands and the opening of a topologically trivial Dirac gap. When two symmetric cavity photon modes are introduced, Dirac cones remain gapless, but a Fermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the relevant role of nonlocal interactions. These effects disappear in the classical limit for coherent photon modes. This new self-consistent theoretical framework paves the way for the simulation of non-perturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled light-matter systems, and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of novel cavity-induced quantum phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Chiral near-field control of quantum light generation using magneto-optical graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikkel Have Eriksen, Joel D. Cox</p>
            <p>We theoretically explore strategies to actively control photon emission from quantum light sources by leveraging the large magneto-optical response of graphene. The quantum electrodynamic response of graphene -- characterized by the Purcell factor and the Lamb shift of a proximal emitter -- is analyzed for extended two-dimensional sheets, one-dimensional nanoribbons, and zero-dimensional nanodisks, all of which are endowed with an intrinsic chiral near-field response under a static perpendicular magnetic field. Using rigorous semianalytical models of these systems, we reveal that the emission properties can be readily tuned by variations in doping charge carrier density and applied magnetic field strength, both with respect to magnetoplasmon resonances (at infrared frequencies) and Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations (entering telecommunication bands) associated with optical transitions between discrete Landau levels. Localized magnetoplasmons in graphene nanoribbons are predicted to induce large dissymmetry in the spontaneous emission from left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized transitions in a proximal quantum emitter, presenting applications for chiral quantum optical waveguiding. This chiral dissymmetry is further enhanced in gyrotropic graphene nanodisks, signaling that the spatial shaping of near-fields in nanostructured graphene can significantly boost the intrinsic chiral response induced by the magnetic field. These results indicate that magneto-optical graphene constitutes a versatile and highly tunable platform for quantum light generation and manipulation at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>Exploring the relations between coexisting, cooperative, or competing types of ordering is a key to identify and harness the mechanisms governing the mutual interactions between them, and to utilize their combined properties. We have experimentally explored the response of the charge density wave (CDW) to various antiferromagnetic, metamagnetic, and field-aligned ferromagnetic states that constitute the magnetic phase diagram of TmNiC$_2$. The high resolution x-ray diffraction experiment employing synchrotron radiation at low temperature and high magnetic field, allowed to follow the superstructure satellite reflections, being a sensitive probe of CDW. This investigation not only reveals direct evidence that the charge density wave avoids even a partial suppression in the antiferromagnetic ground state but also proves that this state coexists, without any visible signatures of weakening, in the entire dome of the magnetically ordered phases, including the field-aligned ferromagnetic state. The calculations of the electronic and phonon structures support the experiment, revealing that the dominant contribution to the CDW transition stems from momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling. We conclude that this mechanism prevents the CDW from vanishing, although the nesting conditions within the magnetically ordered phases deteriorate.</p>

Twist angle, pressure, and strain directly modify the lattice, and thus act as highly effective tuning parameters. Here we examine electrical transport in twisted bilayer graphene subjected to continuous uniaxial strain. Near the magic angle ($\approx 1.1^{\circ}$), devices exhibit a pronounced elastoresistance that depends on band filling and temperature, with a gauge factor more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional metals. In selected doping regimes the elastoresistance exhibits a Curie-Weiss-like temperature divergence. We discuss possible microscopic origins, including nematic fluctuations and enhanced electronic entropy from fluctuating isospin moments. Our work establishes uniaxial strain as a versatile probe of correlated physics in a moiré material.</p>

            <p>Topological photonics is developed based on the analogy of Schrödinger equation which is mathematically reduced to a standard eigenvalue equation. Notably, several photonic systems are beyond the standard topological band theory as they are described by generalized or nonlinear eigenvalue equations. In this article, we review the topological band theory of this category. In the first part, we discuss topological photonics of generalized eigenvalue equations where the band structure may take complex values even when the involved matrices are Hermitian. These complex bands explain the characteristic dispersion relation of hyperbolic metamaterials. In addition, our numerical analysis predicts the emergence of symmetry-protected exceptional points in a photonic crystal composed of negative index media. In the second part, by introducing auxiliary bands, we establish the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence under ``weak" nonlinearity of eigenvalues. The nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence elucidates the robustness of chiral edge modes in photonic systems where the permittivity and permeability are frequency dependent.</p>

            <p>Exploration of nontrivial superconductivity and electronic band topology is at the core of condensed matter physics and applications to quantum information. The transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) MoTe$_2$ has been proposed as an ideal candidate to explore the interplay between topology and superconductivity, but their studies remain limited regarding the required high-pressure environments. Here, we observe proximity-induced surface $p$-wave superconductivity, and investigate the higher-order topological nature of MoTe$_2$ in its 1T$'$ phase, which emerges from the T$_d$ phase through a high-pressure-induced topological phase transition. Using surface-sensitive soft-point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy, we confirm the emergence of surface $s+p$-wave superconductivity via the BTK model as well as a zero-bias conductance peak. Such surface $p$-wave superconductivity emerges via the proximity effect between an $s$-wave superconducting band and a second-order topological band, which is protected by the time-reversal and inversion symmetries. The temperature dependence of the surface $p$-wave superconducting gap shows a correlation with that of the bulk $s$-wave gap, as well as its suppression by an external magnetic field or a reduction in pressure, implying its proximity-induced origin. Moreover, we suggest that the topological hinge states, derived from second-order topological bands, evolve into zero-energy Majorana corner states in this proximity-effect-induced third-order topological superconducting phase. These results demonstrate the potential realization of topological superconductivity in MoTe$_2$, thus opening a pathway for studying various topological natures of TMDC materials.</p>

            <p>Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.</p>

            <p>Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.</p>

            <p>Meta-optics, the application of metasurfaces into optical systems, is seeing an accelerating development owing to advantages in size, weight and cost and the ability to program optical functions beyond traditional refractive optics. The transition of meta-optics from the laboratory into applications is enabled by scalable production methods based on highly reproducible semiconductor process technology. Here, we introduce a novel method for fabrication of double-sided metasurfaces through deep-UV lithography as a production-ready method for achieving high-quality meta-optics. We achieve patterning of a silicon wafer on both sides with mutual alignment of around 25 $\mu$m based on tool accuracy, without requiring through-wafer alignment markers other than the wafer notch. A first novel application highlighting the benefits of double-sided design is demonstrated in the form of a dual-band metalens with independent control over focal lengths in mid- and long-wave infrared bands. Using multi-reticle stitching we demonstrate a 40 mm diameter, large-area metalens with excellent broadband imaging performance, showing partial cancelling of chromatic dispersion when used in a hybrid configuration with a BaF$_2$ refractive lens. Our work opens new avenues for infrared meta-optics designs and double-side meta-optics fabrication through a production-ready technique which can be directly translated into scalable technology for real-world applications.</p>

            <p>Ising machines (IMs) are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). They consist of artificial spins that evolve towards a low-energy configuration representing a problem's solution. Most realistic COPs require both spin-spin couplings and external fields. In IMs with analog spins, these interactions scale differently with the continuous spin amplitudes, leading to imbalances that affect performance. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, but their performance has not been benchmarked. We address this gap through a numerical analysis. We evaluate the time-to-solution of these methods across three distinct problem classes with up to 500 spins. Our results show that the most effective way to incorporate external fields is through an approach where the spin interactions are proportional to the spin signs, rather than their continuous amplitudes.</p>

TRSB is generically accompanied by a skew-symmetric term in the electrodynamic response tensors (permittivity, conductivity, surface impedance), imparting a nonreciprocal phase shift to left- and right-circularly polarized electromagnetic waves reflected from the surface of such a material. We show that TRSB manifests as a difference in the surface reactance experienced by circularly polarized waves, and can be detected using a doubly degenerate resonator mode, such as the TE$_{111}$ mode of a cylindrical cavity. In addition to the frequency splitting induced by TRSB we show that, when interrogated by circularly polarized microwaves, the forward and reverse transmission responses of such a resonator break reciprocity, providing a crucial signature that distinguishes true Faraday effects (i.e., circular birefringence) from non-TRSB effects such as linear birefringence. In the limit that the sample is larger than the spot size (i.e., larger than the diameter of the microwave cavity) we show that the TRSB resonator has sensitivity to polar Kerr angle comparable to that of the zero-loop-area Sagnac, and should provide complementary insights into unconventional superconductors such as UPt$_3$ and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ that have been observed to spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry.</p>

            <p>The optical response of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors such as monolayer WSe$_2$ is dominated by excitons. Enhanced interactions result in the formation of many-body excitonic complexes, which provide a testing ground for excitons and quantum many-body theories. In particular, correlated many-body excitonic complexes could constitute a limiting case that puts competing exciton descriptions to the test. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved many-body excitonic complex that emerges upon electrostatically doping both the $K$ and $Q$ valleys with charge carriers. We optically probe the WSe$_2$ exciton landscape using charge-tunable devices with unusually thin gate dielectrics that facilitate doping up to several $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this previously unexplored regime, we observe the emergence of the thermodynamically stable state in the presence of as many as 10 filled valleys. We gain insight into the physics of this complex using magneto-optical measurements. Our results are well-described by a model where the behavior of the formed exciton complex depends on the number of distinguishable Fermi seas with which the photoexcited electron-hole pair interacts. In addition to expanding the repertoire of excitons in 2D semiconductors, the extremal nature of this complex could probe the limit of exciton models and could help answer open questions about the screened Coulomb interaction in low-dimensional semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Collective excitations and stability of a non-Fermi liquid state near a quantum-critical point of a metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasha Gindikin, Dmitrii L. Maslov, Andrey V. Chubukov</p>
            <p>We examine the spectral properties of collective excitations with finite angular momentum $l$ for a system of interacting fermions near a Pomeranchuk quantum critical point, both in the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. Previous studies found that deep in the Fermi liquid regime, the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ behave differently - the latter is suppressed compared to the former because of kinematic constraints on scattering processes. The main focus of our paper is to understand how the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ evolve as the system enters the non-Fermi liquid regime. We obtain the full scaling function for the electron polarization bubble at arbitrary $l$, which interpolates between the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. We show that collective excitations for all $l$ remain stable and causal throughout the crossover and right at the quantum critical point.</p>

            <h2>Polarization switching in sliding ferroelectrics: the roles of fluctuation and domain wall</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziwen Wang, Shuai Dong</p>
            <p>Sliding ferroelectricity is highly attractive for its low energy barriers and fatigue resistance. As the origin of these exotic properties, its unconventional switching dynamics remains poorly understood: how an electric field drives a perpendicular sliding? Taking $h$-BN bilayer as a model system, its switching dynamics is studied using \textit{ab initio} calculations. The off-diagonal Born effective charge leads to the perpendicular relationship between the electric field and ionic movements. Interestingly, the rules of intrinsic coercive field are distinct between $h$-BN bilayer and conventional ferroelectrics. For $h$-BN bilayer, any perturbation breaking the in-plane symmetry plays a key role to assist the avalanche-like switching dynamics. Moreover, the exotic large off-diagonal Born effective charge near the $P=0$ intermediate state results in a wriggling motion of domain walls in $h$-BN bilayer. Our results reveal the key factors in the ferroelectric switching of sliding ferroelectrics at room temperature.</p>

            <p>Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems with high Chern number ($|C|>1$) are rare. This Letter introduces a Haldane-graphene multilayer heterostructure hosting QAH states with arbitrary Chern number. In a rhombohedral-stacked graphene $N$-layer, the Dirac points at $K_{\pm}$ become $N^\text{th}$-order zeros of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian. When an extra layer of Haldane model is stacked on top of the multilayer, the high-order Dirac points are gapped out and the heterostructure enters QAH phases with $|C|=N+1$. Therefore, gapping out high-order Dirac points paves a new way to high Chern number QAH states.</p>

            <h2>Functional approach to superfluid stiffness: Role of quantum geometry in unconventional superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Buthenhoff, Tobias Holder, Michael M. Scherer</p>
            <p>Non-trivial quantum geometry of electronic bands has been argued to facilitate superconductivity even for the case of flat dispersions where the conventional contribution to the superfluid weight is suppressed by the large effective mass. However, most previous work focused on the case of conventional superconductivity while many contemporary superconducting quantum materials are expected to host unconventional pairing. Here, we derive a generalized expression for the superfluid weight employing mean-field BCS theory for systems with time-reversal symmetry in the normal state and arbitrary unconventional superconducting order with zero-momentum intraband pairing. Our derivation reveals the necessity of incorporating functional derivatives of the grand potential with respect to the superconducting gap function. Through perturbative analysis in the isolated narrow-bands limit, we demonstrate that this contribution arises from quantum geometrical effects, specifically due to a non-trivial Wilczek-Zee connection. Utilizing the newly obtained expressions for the superfluid weight, we apply our framework to an extended Kane-Mele model, contrasting conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>One-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiga Nakamoto, Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji</p>
            <p>We study the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity, which describes an interplay of the effect of vacuum fluctuation of light and the quantum phase transition between the charge- and spin-density-wave phases. The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</p>

            <p>Several superconducting phases have been discovered close to a metamagnetic transition in the heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$, unveiling a close relation between its superconducting and magnetic properties. Although suspected to be of magnetic nature, the mechanisms stabilizing these superconducting phases remain mysterious. Here, we present electrical-resistivity measurements on UTe$_2$, with a current $\mathbf{I}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60~T rotating in the ($\mathbf{b}$,$\mathbf{c}$) plane. The Fermi-liquid coefficient $A$ of the electrical resistivity reaches its maximal values at the metamagnetic transition in fields tilted by $30-40~^\circ$ from $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{c}$, and it becomes asymmetric with higher values above the metamagnetic field than below. The enhancement of $A$ is interpreted as resulting from enhanced magnetic fluctuations, in a regime which coincides with a domain of stabilization of superconductivity beyond $40$~T. These results show that the magnetic fluctuations probed here probably play a key role in stabilizing high-field superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and may provide further insight into the superconducting mechanisms.</p>

            <p>The progress of designing organic semiconductors is extensively dependent on the quality of prepared organic molecular assemblies, since the charge transport mechanism is strongly efficient in highly ordered crystals compared to amorphous domains. Here we present a comprehensive photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and time-of-flight (TOF) spectroscopic study of rubrene ($\mathrm{C}_{48}\mathrm{H}_{24}$) thin crystals focusing on recently developed orthorhombic crystalline morphologies applied in organic electronic devices. Using femtosecond pulsed lasers with photon energies between 3-6 eV, we explore the interplay between photoemission processes, crystal morphology, and defect states. In a 2-photon photoemission process (2PPE), the PEEM images reveal dominant emission localized at domain boundaries, indicating strong contributions from trap states. In contrast, in 1PPE nm excitation uniform emission across the crystal surface is observed, highlighting a fundamental difference in photoemission mechanisms. Furthermore, in the intermediate photon energy range, we identify a nonlinear, non-integer photon order, where mostly the triclinic morphology contributes to the emission, distinguishing it from the orthorhombic phase. These findings provide a new framework for assessing the quality and internal structure of organic semiconductor thin films via wavelength-dependent photoemission imaging and spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>Graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) exhibit rich magnetic behaviors arising from two primary mechanisms: geometry frustration in non-Kekulé structures and electron delocalization-driven aromatic stabilization in Kekulé-type systems. Herein, we develop a unified bonding entropy model (BEM) to quantitatively characterize the magnetic properties in GNFs within a statistical framework, providing an entropy-based criterion for understanding and predicting bond occupancy numbers and unpaired electron distributions. While non-Kekulé systems naturally favor high-spin configurations due to topological frustration, the BEM reveals that even Kekulé-type GNFs can exhibit magnetic character when the entropy gain from unpaired electrons outweighs the loss of aromatic stabilization. The model predictions show excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations in terms of spin density distributions and unpaired electron counts. Our results establish bonding entropy as a general guiding principle for designing carbon-based magentic materials with tunable magnetic properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erwin Hüger, Harald Schmidt</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that for polycrystalline LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 c-axis textured thin film cathodes of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the kinetics of Li storage and release including maximum specific capacity is determined by Li diffusion. The C-rate capability and long-term cycling behavior were investigated. The films exhibited up to 30% of the expected practical capacity even at low C-rates. However, 100% capacity was achieved at very low cycling rates below 0.01C. The capacity showed a reversible behaviour with changing current density, indicating no film degradation. The C-rate capability experiment showed a square root dependence of capacities on current density, which corresponds to a diffusion-controlled process. The estimated diffusivities from the cycling experiments are independent of the current density. The Li chemical and tracer diffusivities were measured using standard electrochemical and non-electrochemical diffusion measurement techniques. Chemical diffusivities, thermodynamic factor, and hence Li tracer diffusivities were determined from potentiostatic intermittent titration (PITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments as a function of electrode potential and state of charge (SOC). The diffusivities were found to be approximately independent of potential, SOC and cycle number. The Li tracer diffusivities were validated by 6Li tracer diffusion experiments with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The diffusivities obtained by PITT and SIMS were found to be more reliable for Li uptake and release than those obtained by EIS. Based on the diffusion results, a C-rate limit for full film delithiation below 0.01 C was calculated due to slow Li diffusion.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the topological properties of triplon excitations in spin-1/2 dimer-singlet ground states defined on the maple leaf and star lattices. Our analysis is based on a model that includes Heisenberg interactions, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, and an external magnetic field. In the absence of an in-plane DM vector, we demonstrate that the triplon Hamiltonian maps onto the magnon Hamiltonian of the Kagome lattice, inheriting its nontrivial topological characteristics, including Berry curvature and topological invariants such as the Z2 invariant and Chern numbers. This correspondence enables us to derive analytical expressions for the spin Nernst and thermal Hall conductivities at low temperatures. Furthermore, we explore the effects of realistic finite in-plane DM interactions, uncovering multiple topological transitions and a complex thermal Hall conductivity behavior, including potential sign reversals as functions of magnetic field and temperature. Using layer groups, we also provide a symmetry classification of the star and maple leaf lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artem Fediai, Franz Symalla, Tobias Neumann, Wolfgang Wenzel</p>
            <p>In organic electronics, conductivity doping is used primarily to eliminate charge injection barriers in organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics and other electronic devices. Therefore, research on conductivity doping is primarily focused on understanding and enhancing the properties of these doped layers. In contrast, this work shifts the focus from optimizing doped layers to leveraging the doping process as a tool for investigating fundamental material properties. Specifically, the dopant is used as an "agent" to enable the measurement of three critical parameters: ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), and Coulomb interaction energy (VC) - that govern dopant ionization and play central roles in organic electronic devices in general. While these parameters can be measured experimentally, conventional approaches often involve intricate or indirect methods, such as spectral deconvolution, which may introduce ambiguities or fail to represent bulk properties. Here it is shown how consolidating the experimental data and simulations on the dopant ionization fraction and doped-induced conductivity can be used to estimate the mean IP or EA of the embedded organic molecule, and VC of the embedded charge-transfer complex. These results illustrate how measuring and simulating doped materials can provide access to the fundamental design parameters of organic electronic devices</p>

            <p>Realizing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in ultracold atomic systems remains a major goal despite numerous experimental advances in the last few decades. Recent progress in trap anisotropy control under rapid rotation has renewed interest in ultracold atomic FQH physics, enabling experiments that impart much larger angular momentum per particle and offer in-situ imaging with resolution finer than the cyclotron orbit size. In this paper, we present a theoretical investigation of a rapidly rotating anisotropic Bose gas. By projecting the full Hamiltonian, including both kinetic and interaction terms, onto the lowest Landau level, we derive a compact two-parameter model that captures the effects of interaction strength, rotation rate, and anisotropy. Using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group, we obtain a phase diagram that features broken-symmetry phases and topologically ordered quantum Hall states, while also highlighting the distinctive physics arising from the system's edges. Our results demonstrate the potential for future theoretical and experimental exploration of anisotropic quantum fluids, offering a unified framework for weakly interacting Bose condensates, vortex matter, and strongly correlated topological phases.</p>

            <p>The integration of high-dielectric-constant (high-$\kappa$) materials with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is promising to overcome performance limitations and reach their full theoretical potential. Here we show that naturally occurring phlogopite mica, exfoliated into ultrathin flakes, can serve as a robust high-$\kappa$ dielectric layer for transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D electronics and optoelectronics. Phlogopite's wide bandgap (~4.8 eV), high dielectric constant (~11), and large breakdown field (10 MVcm$^{-1}$) enable transistors with subthreshold swings down to 100 mVdec$^{-1}$, minimal hysteresis (30-60 mV) and interface trap densities comparable to state-of-the-art oxide dielectrics. Moreover, phototransistors built upon monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) and phlogopite exhibit responsivities up to 3.3x10$^{4}$ AW$^{-1}$ and detectivities near 10$^{10}$ Jones, surpassing devices based on conventional gate insulators. We further demonstrate the versatility of this natural dielectric by integrating phlogopite/MoS$_2$ heterostructures into NMOS inverters, showcasing robust voltage gains and low-voltage operation. Our findings establish phlogopite as a promising, earth-abundant dielectric for next-generation 2D transistor technologies and high-performance photodetection.</p>

            <p>The liquid crystal with suspended ferroelectric nanoparticles is an interesting object for fundamental research of the long-range dipole-dipole interactions; as well as it is promising for optical, optoelectronic and electrochemical applications. Such suspensions can serve as basic elements for advanced nonvolatile memory cells and energy storage devices. The work studies the cells filled with a nematic liquid crystal 5CB and the cells containing 5CB with 0.5 wt.% and 1 wt.% of BaTiO3 nanoparticles with an average size of 24 nm. We analyzed the time dependences of the current flowing through the cells at constant applied voltage and the voltage dynamics in the no-load mode. The time dependences of the current and voltage show a slowing down decay rate. For the cells with BaTiO3 nanoparticles, the decrease in the decay time is characteristic. A possible physical reason for the retarding decay time rate is the indirect effect of screening charges, which cover ferroelectric nanoparticles, and slow ionic transport in the liquid crystal. To explain the dynamics of current and voltage, the finite element modeling of the polarization distribution, domain structure dynamics, and charge state of nanoparticles in a liquid crystal is performed using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach. Theoretical results confirmed the leading role of screening charges, because the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle adsorbs an ionic-electronic charge that partially screens its spontaneous polarization in single-domain and/or poly-domain states. When an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal with nanoparticles, it can release part of the screening charge (mainly due to the change in the polarization of the nanoparticle), which will lead to a decrease in decay time rate of the current and voltage dependences.</p>

            <p>Significant magnetic exchange interactions have been observed in infinite-layer nickelates RNiO2 (R = La, Pr, Nd), which exhibit unconventional superconductivity upon hole doping. Despite their structural and Fermi surface similarities to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates possess a larger charge transfer gap, which influences their magnetic exchange interactions via oxygen. In this work, we performed 17O nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on LaNiO2 and Sr-doped LaNiO2, revealing glassy spin dynamics originating from Ni-O planes. This indicates that infinite-layer nickelates are in proximity to magnetic ordering and that magnetic correlations play a crucial role in their physics. More importantly, our analysis of the Knight shift and hyperfine coupling of 17O nuclei revealed that the Ni-Ni superexchange interaction, mediated by the {\sigma} bond between the Ni-dx2-y2 and O-p orbitals, is one order of magnitude weaker than that in cuprates. This alone cannot account for the total magnetic exchange interaction observed in nickelates. First-principles many-body calculations indicate that an interstitial s orbital near the Fermi level, coupled with the Ni-d3z2-r2 orbital, significantly enhances the superexchange interaction. This contrasts with cuprates, where magnetic interactions are predominantly governed by Cu-dx2-y2 superexchange via oxygen. Our findings provide new insights into the distinct magnetic interactions in infinite-layer nickelates and their potential role in unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We use molecular dynamics simulation to study the relationship between structure and dynamics in supercooled binary Lennard--Jones nanoparticles over a range of particle sizes. The glass transition temperature of the nanoparticles is found to be significantly lowered relative to the bulk, decreasing as $N^{-1/3}$ with decreasing particle size. This allows the nanoparticles to sample low energy states on the potential energy landscape and we are able to study their relaxation times, measured in terms of the intermediate scattering function, and their structure, measured in terms of locally favoured structures, to low temperatures. Our work shows that the growing relaxation times in the supercooled nanoparticles are coupled with the growth of physical clusters formed from favoured local structures in a way that is well described by the Random First Order Transition entropic droplet model, but with exponents that are dependent on the nanoparticle size.</p>

Unusually, these are accompanied by boundary layers in the TASEP lane. These universal DWs replace the maximal current phases in TASEPs. For smaller values of $\alpha,\,\beta$, the DWs depend upon them, and hence are nonuniversal.

            <p>We probe experimentally a connection between coherence in the context of optical physics and the irreversibility present in heat transfer through an interface separating two media. The robustness of the experiment on the one hand, and the theoretical description taken from the statistical-mechanics treatment of the heat transfer problem, on the other hand, allows for the study of the arrow of time's problem within the clean and precise framework of experimental optical physics. The central aspect of the experiment is a light beam incident and split at an interface to produce a second common interaction point again at the interface. The experiment was carried out with two light sources that only differ in their coherence length. In the case of the highly coherent light source, we were able to combine the previously split parts of the light back into a single beam. This is indicative of the reversibility of the process of coherent light transmission through the interface. The light source with low coherence length, on the contrary, does not allow for such a recombination, thus producing an irreversible process. We explain how the latter case is analogous to the process of interfacial heat transport, thus establishing an important connection between optical non-coherence and irreversibility of transport phenomena. Our finding paves the way for the study of fundamental processes in heat transfer and the surge of irreversibility in the realm of optical physics.</p>

In this work, we analyze a realistic active Szilard engine operating on a single active particle by means of steric interaction with an externally controlled mechanical element. In particular, we provide a comprehensive study of how finite measurement accuracy affects the engine's work and power output, as well as the cost of operation. Having established the existence of non-trivial optima for work and power output, we study the dependence of their loci on the measurement error parameters and identify conditions for their positivity under one-shot and cyclic engine operation. By computing a suitably defined information efficiency, we also demonstrate that this engine design allows for the violation of Landauer's bound on the efficiency of information-to-work conversion. Notably, the information efficiency for one-shot operation exhibits a discontinuous transition and a non-monotonic dependence on the measurement precision. Finally, we show that cyclic operation improves information efficiency by harvesting residual mutual information between successive measurements.</p>

            <p>A new kinetic self-consistent method is presented based on the proposed Gaussian Superposition Principle for computation of ensemble averaged observables of a macromolecule interacting via two-body forces. The latter leads to the derivation of a natural functional closure relation for the 3-point distribution functions (DF), thereby truncating a hierarchy of kinetic equations obtained from the original Langevin equation. The resulting Super Gaussian Self-Consistent (SGSC) equations for the 2-point distribution functions acquire a sufficiently tractable integro-differential form. The SGSC theory strives to yield realistic shapes of various distribution functions for any macromolecule with a generic Hamiltonian involving 2-body interaction potentials, both at equilibrium and during kinetics.</p>

            <p>We present an experimental evidence of 3D superinsulation in a nanopatterned slab of NbTiN, given by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) scaling of the conductance when approaching the critical temperature from above and by the vanishing of the conductance below the transition. In the electric Meissner state, we find polar nematic order arising from ferroelectric alignement of short electric strings excited by external electromagnetic fields. Our results prove that superinsulation appears also in ordered structures provided that these are large enough, thereby confirming the origin of superinsulation as electric confinement, independent of disorder.</p>

            <h2>Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. S. Gavrilov</p>
            <p>We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction.</p>

            <h2>Analytical and Scale-Free Phase-Field Studies of $α$ to $ω$ Phase Transformation in Single Crystal Zirconium under Nonhydrostatic Loadings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raghunandan Pratoori, Hamed Babaei, Valery I. Levitas</p>
            <p>Zirconium (Zr) is an important engineering material with numerous practical applications. It undergoes martensitic $\alpha$ to $\omega$ phase transformation (PT) at pressures that vary from 0.67 GPa to 17 GPa under different loading conditions. Despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies, the effect of the nonhydrostatic stresses is not well understood. To separate the effect of nonhydrostatic stresses from the plastic deformation, a scale-free phase field approach (PFA) for multivariant $\alpha$ to $\omega$ PT in a single crystal Zr under general nonhydrostatic loadings is presented. Explicit conditions for the direct and reverse PTs between austenite and martensitic variants and between martensitic variants under general stress tensor are derived and analyzed. In particular, the effect of the deviatoric stresses on the PT pressures is elucidated. It is shown that their effect cannot explain much larger reduction in the transformation pressure observed during plastic flow, i.e., specific mechanisms of strain-induced phase transformations should be involved. Under assumption of the homogeneous fields in the sample, complete analytical solutions that include stress-strain curves during the PT, PT start and finish stresses (i.e., stress hysteresis), and volume fraction of the variants, are determined for different loadings. Finite element method (FEM) solutions are found for the phase field simulations of the microstructure evolution for the same loadings, as well as for two grains of the polycrystalline sample. Macroscopic averaged characteristics of the PFA solutions are well described by an analytical solution, which also simplifies their interpretations. Obtained results are in good qualitative agreement with existing experiments. In addition, some controversies of the previous approaches are analysed.</p>

            <p>The magnetic property of the Heusler alloys can be predicted by the famous Slater-Pauling (S-P) rule, which states the total magnetic moment ($m_t$) of such materials can be expressed as $m _t\,=\,(N_V-24)\,\mu_B/f.u.$, where $N_V$ is the total valence electron count (VEC). Consequently, no Heusler alloys having VEC = 24 are theoretically expected as well as experimentally reported to have any magnetic ordering. Recently, a special class of Heusler alloys with 50\% concentration of $p$-block elements (anti-Heusler) have been identified, although none of such reported compounds belong to the VEC 24 category. Here, we report a new anti-Heusler alloy, Al$_2$MnCu, that undergoes long-range ferromagnetic (FM) ordering with $T_{\rm C}\sim$315 K and a large magnetic moment of $\sim$1.8 $\mu_B$/f.u. despite having VEC 24. A phenomenological model based on molecular orbital hybridization is also proposed to understand the magnetism and unusual deviation from the standard S-P rule.</p>

            <p>The development of magnonic devices requires energy-efficient methods for generating spin waves and controlling their parameters. Acoustic waves are known to excite spin waves resonantly with magneto-elastic wave formation or to drive non-resonantly forced magnetization oscillations. Short acoustic wavevpackets enable another resonant interaction regime - Cherenkov radiation of spin waves. This poses a question on the criteria and signatures of transitions between these three regimes of a picosecond magnetoacoustic. Here, we use the scanning magneto-optical pump-probe technique to directly reveal all three regimes of interactions of laser-driven acoustic and magnetostatic wave packets in a thin permalloy film and a waveguide on top of a (011)-Si substrate. Direct measurements of the phase velocities revealed the transition from coupled magneto-elastic wavepacket to Cherenkov-like radiation and non-resonant regime controlled by the detuning between magnon and phonon group velocities. Acoustic pulse is found to be affected by the excited magnetization dynamics only in the magneto-elastic regime.</p>

            <p>Triangulenes are prototypical examples of open-shell nanographenes. Their magnetic properties, arising from the presence of unpaired $\pi$ electrons, can be extensively tuned by modifying their size and shape or by introducing heteroatoms. Different triangulene derivatives have been designed and synthesized in recent years, thanks to the development of on-surface synthesis strategies. Triangulene-based nanostructures with polyradical character, hosting several interacting spin units, can be challenging to fabricate but are particularly interesting for potential applications in carbon-based spintronics. Here, we combine pristine and N-doped triangulenes into a more complex nanographene, \textbf{TTAT}, predicted to possess three unpaired $\pi$ electrons delocalized along the zigzag periphery. We generate the molecule on an Au(111) surface and detect direct fingerprints of multi-radical coupling and high-spin state using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. With the support of theoretical calculations, we show that its three radical units are localized at distinct parts of the molecule and couple via symmetric ferromagnetic interactions, which result in a $S=3/2$ ground state, thus demonstrating the realization of a molecular ferromagnetic Heisenberg-like spin trimer</p>

            <p>This study benchmarks the geometric, frequency, non-covalent (GFN) semi-empirical methods, GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, GFN0-xTB, and GFN-FF, against density functional theory (DFT) for the geometry optimization of small organic semiconductor molecules. Two datasets are evaluated: a QM9-derived subset of small organic molecules and the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) database of extended $\pi$-systems relevant to organic photovoltaics. Structural agreement is quantified using heavy-atom RMSD, equilibrium rotational constants, bond lengths, angles, and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. Computational efficiency is assessed via CPU time and scaling behavior. GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB demonstrate the highest structural fidelity, while GFN-FF offers an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, particularly for larger systems. The results indicate that GFN-based methods are suitable for high-throughput molecular screening of small organic semiconductors, the choice of the method depending on the accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings support the deployment of GFN approaches in computational pipelines for the discovery of organic electronics and materials, providing information on their strengths and limitations relative to established DFT methods.</p>

            <p>The interplay of electronic and structural degrees of freedom is at the heart of some of the most astonishing phenomena found in condensed matter physics, for example, the condensation of electron pairs into a macroscopically coherent ground state in superconductors. In magnetic materials, magnetic interactions couple to lattice degrees of freedom resulting in magnetoelastic coupling - an effect that is typically small and only detectable on macroscopic samples. Here, we demonstrate giant magnetoelastic coupling in the correlated itinerant ferromagnet Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$. We establish control of the magnetism in the surface layer and use this control to probe the impact of the magnetism on its electronic and structural properties. By using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we reveal subtle changes in the electronic structure dependent on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment between the surface and subsurface layers. We determine the consequences of the exchange force on the relaxation of the surface layer, exhibiting a giant magnetostriction. Our results provide a direct measurement of the impact of exchange interactions and correlations on structural details in a quantum material, reveal how electronic correlations result in strong electron-lattice coupling and establish Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ as a system to study magnetism in 2D.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah Pelofske, Georg Hahn, Hristo Djidjev</p>
            <p>Posiform planting is a method for constructing QUBO problems with a single unique planted solution that can be tailored to arbitrary connectivity graphs. In this study we investigate making posiform planted QUBOs computationally harder by fusing many smaller random discrete coefficient spin-glass Ising models, whose global minimum energy is computed classically using classical binary integer programming optimization software, with posiform-planted QUBOs. The single unique ground-state solution of the resulting QUBO problem is the concatenation of (exactly one of) the ground-states of each of the smaller problems. We apply these modified posiform planted QUBOs to the task of benchmarking programmable D-Wave quantum annealers. The proposed method enables generating binary variable combinatorial optimization problems that cover the entire quantum annealing processor hardware graph, have a unique solution, are entirely hardware-graph-native, and can have tunable computational hardness. We benchmark the capabilities of three D-Wave superconducting qubit quantum annealing processors, having from 563 up to 5627 qubits, to sample the optimal unique planted solution of problems generated by our proposed method and compare them against simulated annealing and Gurobi. We find that the D-Wave QPU ground-state sampling success rate does not change with respect to the size of the random QUBOs we employ. Surprisingly, we find that some of these classes of QUBOs are solved at very high success rates at short annealing times compared to longer annealing times for the Zephyr connectivity graph QPUs.</p>

            <h2>Biased Degenerate Ground-State Sampling of Small Ising Models with Converged QAOA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah Pelofske</p>
            <p>The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, a generalization of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is a quantum algorithm used for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA typically uses the Transverse field mixer as the driving Hamiltonian. One of the interesting properties of the Transverse-field driving Hamiltonian is that it results in non-uniform sampling of degenerate ground states of optimization problems. In this study we numerically examine the fair sampling properties transverse field mixer QAOA, and Grover Mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) which provides theoretical guarantees of fair sampling of degenerate optimal solutions, up to large enough p such that the mean expectation value converges to an optimal approximation ratio of 1. This comparison is performed with high quality heuristically computed, but not necessarily optimal, QAOA angles which give strictly monotonically improving solution quality as p increases. These angles are computed using the Julia based numerical simulation software JuliQAOA. Fair sampling of degenerate ground-states is quantified using Shannon entropy of the ground-state amplitudes distribution. The fair sampling properties are reported on several quantum signature Hamiltonians from previous quantum annealing fair sampling studies. Small random fully connected spin glasses are shown which exhibit exponential suppression of some degenerate ground-states with transverse field mixer QAOA. The transverse field mixer QAOA simulations show that some problem instances clearly saturate the Shannon entropy of 0 with a maximally biased distribution that occurs when the learning converges to an approximation ratio of 1 while other problem instances never deviate from a maximum Shannon entropy (uniform distribution) at any p step.</p>

            <p>The origin of dark matter is a fundamental problem in physics. Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak Chern-Simons couplings to electromagnetism, gravity, and fermions. We propose a novel symmetry-breaking detection mechanism in magnetoelectric materials, allowing for a linear axionic coupling between magnetism and ferroelectric polarization. We focus on strain gradient Sr2IrO4, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field within the material. This mechanism amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. These signals can be detected by monitoring changes in macroscopic physical quantities, such as the magnetoelectric and magnetic responses. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism significantly enhances the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanghyeon Park, Yuseung Hong, Hyunseo Choi</p>
            <p>The use of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) in modern warfare cannot be disregarded due to their ease of use and potential for large-scale incapacitation. An effective countermeasure involves the physical adsorption of these agents, preventing their entry through the respiratory tract by non-specific adsorption. In this study, we investigate the physical interaction between potential adsorbents and model gases mimicking CWAs, thereby identifying sufficient conditions for higher physical adsorption performance. Our findings reveal that the physical adsorption capacity is highly sensitive to the surface properties of the adsorbents, with uniform development of micropores, rather than solely high surface area, emerging as a critical factor. Additionally, we identified the potential of porous organic polymers as promising alternatives to conventional activated carbon-based adsorbents. Through a facile introduction of polar sulfone functional groups on the polymer surface, we demonstrated that these polar surface polymers exhibit physical adsorption capabilities for formaldehyde under ambient conditions comparable to high-performance activated carbons. Notably, the superior activated carbon possessed a high BET surface area of 2400 m^2/g and an exceptionally uniform micropore structure with an average pore size of approximately 11 Angstroms. This research paves the way for designing adsorbents with high physical adsorption capacities tailored for CWAs protection, offering a significant advancement in developing next-generation protective materials.</p>

            <p>Experimentally acquired microscopy images are unavoidably affected by the presence of noise and other unwanted signals, which degrade their quality and might hide relevant features. With the recent increase in image acquisition rate, modern denoising and restoration solutions become necessary. This study focuses on image decomposition and denoising of microscopy images through a workflow based on total variation (TV), addressing images obtained from various microscopy techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our approach consists in restoring an image by extracting its unwanted signal components and subtracting them from the raw one, or by denoising it. We evaluate the performance of TV-$L^1$, Huber-ROF, and TGV-$L^1$ in achieving this goal in distinct study cases. Huber-ROF proved to be the most flexible one, while TGV-$L^1$ is the most suitable for denoising. Our results suggest a wider applicability of this method in microscopy, restricted not only to STM, AFM, and SEM images. The Python code used for this study is publicly available as part of AiSurf. It is designed to be integrated into experimental workflows for image acquisition or can be used to denoise previously acquired images.</p>

            <p>Peptides are recognized for their varied self-assembly behaviors, forming a wide array of structures and geometries, such as spheres, fibers, and hydrogels, each presenting a unique set of material properties. The functionalities of these materials hold exceptional interest for applications in biology, medicine, photonics, nanotechnology and the food industry. In specific, the ability to exploit peptides as viable and sustainable mechanical materials requires sequence design that enables superior performance, notably a high Young's modulus. As the peptide sequence space is vast, however, even a slight increase in sequence length leads to an exponential increase in the number of potential peptide sequences to be characterized. Here, we combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, atomic force microscopy experiments and machine learning models to correlate the sequence length and composition with the mechanical properties of self-assembled peptides. We calculate the Young's modulus for all possible amino acid sequences of di- and tripeptides using high-throughput coarse-grained methods, and validate these calculations through in-situ mechanical characterization. For pentapeptides, we select and calculate properties for a subset of sequences to train a machine learning model, which allows us to predict the modulus for other sequences. The combined workflow not only identifies promising peptide candidates with exceptional mechanical performances, but also extends current understanding of the sequence-to-function relationships for peptide materials, for specific applications.</p>

Spin-singlet neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing is abundant in the nuclear chart but spin-triplet and mixed-spin proton-neutron pairing correlations have also been predicted to form at least in the ground states of certain nuclei. A realistic candidate region is that of the lightest Lanthanides where it was recently demonstrated that the nuclear deformation expected to emerge enhances spin-triplet pairing correlations. In this paper we provide the details of the deformed multimodal Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory that lead to this conclusion, as well as the details of the effects identified. We present in detail the response of different pairing correlations to various deformation modes and calculate their signatures in the odd-even staggering of masses.

Inspired by the similarities in the training trajectories of deep networks and linear networks, we analytically characterize this phenomenon for the latter. We show, using tools in dynamical systems theory, that the geometry of this low-dimensional manifold is controlled by (i) the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix of the training data, (ii) the relative scale of the ground-truth output to the weights at the beginning of training, and (iii) the number of steps of gradient descent. By analytically computing and bounding the contributions of these quantities, we characterize phase boundaries of the region where hyper-ribbons are to be expected. We also extend our analysis to kernel machines and linear models that are trained with stochastic gradient descent.</p>

            <p>Discrete time quasi-crystals are non-equilibrium quantum phenomena with quasi-periodic order in the time dimension, and are an extension of the discrete time-crystal phase. As a natural platform to explore the non-equilibrium phase of matter, the Rydberg atomic array has implemented the quantum simulation of the discrete-time crystal phase, associated with quantum many-body scar state. However, the existence of discrete time quasi-crystal on the Rydberg cold atom experiment platform has yet to be conceived. Here, we propose a method to generate the discrete time quasi-crystal behavior by coupling two discrete time-crystals, where associated two external driving frequencies have the maximum incommensurability. While we analysis its robustness and compute the phase diagram of corresponding observables. We significantly calculate the entanglement entropy between two parts of the system. Remarkably, we find the emergence of the aperiodic response is indeed caused by interaction between systems via Rydberg blockade effect. Our method thus offers the possibilities to explore the novel phases in quantum simulator.</p>

            <p>The discovery of novel functional materials is crucial in addressing the challenges of sustainable energy generation and climate change. Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have gained attention for their exceptional optoelectronic properties in photovoltaics. Recently, geometric deep learning, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown strong potential in predicting material properties and guiding material design. However, traditional GNNs often struggle to capture the periodic structures and higher-order interactions prevalent in such systems. To address these limitations, we propose a novel representation based on quotient complexes (QCs) and introduce the Quotient Complex Transformer (QCformer) for material property prediction. A material structure is modeled as a quotient complex, which encodes both pairwise and many-body interactions via simplices of varying dimensions and captures material periodicity through a quotient operation. Our model leverages higher-order features defined on simplices and processes them using a simplex-based Transformer module. We pretrain QCformer on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS, and fine-tune it on HOIP datasets. The results show that QCformer outperforms state-of-the-art models in HOIP property prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness. The quotient complex representation and QCformer model together contribute a powerful new tool for predictive modeling of perovskite materials.</p>

            <h2>Optimal randomized measurements for a family of non-linear quantum properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyu Du, Yifan Tang, Andreas Elben, Ingo Roth, Jens Eisert, Zhenhuan Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum learning encounters fundamental challenges when estimating non-linear properties, owing to the inherent linearity of quantum mechanics. Although recent advances in single-copy randomized measurement protocols have achieved optimal sample complexity for specific tasks like state purity estimation, generalizing these protocols to estimate broader classes of non-linear properties without sacrificing optimality remains an open problem. In this work, we introduce the observable-driven randomized measurement (ORM) protocol enabling the estimation of ${\rm Tr}(O\rho^2)$ for an arbitrary observable $O$ -- an essential quantity in quantum computing and many-body physics. ORM achieves this by decomposing the observable $O$ into dichotomic observables and extracting the information of each eigenspace through randomized measurements with block-diagonal unitaries. We establish an upper bound for ORM's sample complexity and prove its optimality for all Pauli observables, closing a gap in the literature. Furthermore, we develop simplified variants of ORM for local Pauli observables and introduce a braiding randomized measurement protocol for fidelity estimation, both of which significantly reduce circuit complexities in practical applications. Numerical experiments validate that ORM requires substantially fewer state samples to achieve the same precision compared to classical shadows.</p>

            <h2>Remarkable universalities in distributions of dynamical observables in chaotic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucianno Defaveri, Naftali R. Smith</p>
            <p>The study of chaotic systems, where rare events play a pivotal role, is essential for understanding complex dynamics due to their sensitivity to initial conditions. Recently, tools from large deviation theory, typically applied in the context of stochastic processes, have been used in the study of chaotic systems. Here, we study dynamical observables, $A = \sum_{n=1}^N g(\textbf{x}_n)$, defined along a chaotic trajectory $\{\textbf{x}_1, \textbf{x}_2, \ldots, \textbf{x}_N\}$. For most choices of $g(\textbf{x})$, $A$ satisfies a central limit theorem: At large sequence size $N \gg 1$, typical fluctuations of $A$ follow a Gaussian distribution with a variance that scales linearly with $N$. Large deviations of $A$ are usually described by the large deviation principle, that is, $P(A) \sim e^{- N I(A/N)}$, where $I(a)$ is the rate function. We find that certain dynamical observables exhibit a remarkable statistical universality: even when constructed with distinct functions $g_1(\textbf{x})$ and $g_2(\textbf{x})$, different observables are described by the same rate function. We provide a physical interpretation for this striking universality by showing that $g_1(\textbf{x})-g_2(\textbf{x})$ belongs to a class of functions that we call ``derived''. Furthermore, we show that if $g(\textbf{x})$ itself is ``derived'', then the distribution of $A$ becomes independent of $N$ in the large-$N$ limit, and is generally non-Gaussian (although it is mirror-symmetric). We demonstrate that the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) for the logistic map is of this derived form, thus providing a simple explanation for some existing results.</p>

            <p>Materials with strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) are essential for realizing spin orbit torque (SOT) based magnetic memory devices. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for such appli cations because of their inherently high SOC strength. In this study, we investigate the spin pumping effect at the interface between a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide (ML-MoS2) and Ni80Fe20 (Py) thin films using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. FMR measurements reveal a notable enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping factor for the ML-MoS2/Py (Pt = 0 nm) interface compared to the reference Py thin films, attributed to spin pumping across the ML-MoS2/Py interface. To further quantify spin pumping efficiency, we introduce a high SOC platinum (Pt) interlayer at the ML-MoS2/Py interface and systematically vary its thickness. This allows us to evaluate key spin transport parameters, including the enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping parameter, the effective spin mixing conductance that reflects the transfer of spin angular momentum from Py to ML-MoS2 and the effective spin current density.</p>

            <p>Long distance quantum networking requires combining efficient spin-photon interfaces with long-lived local memories. Group-IV color centers in diamond (SiV, GeV, and SnV) are promising candidates for this application, containing an electronic spin-photon interface and dopant nuclear spin memory. Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in spin-photon coupling and spin-spin entanglement. However, coupling between the electron and nuclear spins introduces a phase kickback during optical excitation that limits the utility of the nuclear memory. Here, we propose using the large hyperfine coupling of SnV-117 to operate the device at zero magnetic field in a regime where the memory is insensitive to optical excitation. We further demonstrate ground state spin control of a SnV-117 color center integrated in a photonic integrated circuit, showing 97.8% gate fidelity and 2.5 ms coherence time for the memory spin level. This shows the viability of the zero-field protocol for high fidelity operation, and lays the groundwork for building quantum network nodes with SnV-117 devices.</p>

            <h2>Dephasing in Rydberg Facilitation Due to State-Dependent Dipole Forces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Schlegel, Evangelia Konstantinidou, Michael Fleischhauer, Daniel Brady</p>
            <p>Rydberg atoms allow for the experimental study of open many-body systems and nonequilibrium phenomena. High dephasing rates are a generic feature of these systems, and therefore they can often be described by rate equations, i.e. in the classical limit. In this work, we analyze one potential origin of the decoherence in Rydberg atoms: dipole-force induced dephasing. As the wave function of the Rydberg (spin-up) state is repelled in the presence of another nearby Rydberg atom, while the ground (spin-down) state diffuses in place, the Franck-Condon overlap between the two spin components quickly decays causing a decoherence of the spin transition. With an analytic approach we obtain a simple expression for the dephasing rate of the Rydberg state depending on atomic and laser parameters, which agrees with numerical findings.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing, and its controlled generation and detection remain key challenges in scalable quantum architectures. Here, we numerically demonstrate the deterministic generation of entangled spin states in a solid-state platform by implementing quantum gates via electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM). Using two titanium atoms on a MgO/Ag(100) substrate as a model, we construct a two-qubit system whose dynamics are coherently manipulated through tailored microwave pulse sequences. We generate Bell states by implementing a Hadamard gate followed by a controlled-NOT gate, and evaluate its fidelity and concurrence using the quantum-master equation-based code TimeESR. Our results demonstrate that ESR-STM can create entangled states with significant fidelity. This study paves the way for the realization of atom-based quantum circuits and highlights ESR-STM as a powerful tool for probing and engineering entangled states on surfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Sun, Xingzhao Yan, Jordan Scott, Jun-Yu Ou, James N. Monks, Otto L. Muskens</p>
            <p>Meta-optics, the application of metasurfaces into optical systems, is seeing an accelerating development owing to advantages in size, weight and cost and the ability to program optical functions beyond traditional refractive optics. The transition of meta-optics from the laboratory into applications is enabled by scalable production methods based on highly reproducible semiconductor process technology. Here, we introduce a novel method for fabrication of double-sided metasurfaces through deep-UV lithography as a production-ready method for achieving high-quality meta-optics. We achieve patterning of a silicon wafer on both sides with mutual alignment of around 25 $\mu$m based on tool accuracy, without requiring through-wafer alignment markers other than the wafer notch. A first novel application highlighting the benefits of double-sided design is demonstrated in the form of a dual-band metalens with independent control over focal lengths in mid- and long-wave infrared bands. Using multi-reticle stitching we demonstrate a 40 mm diameter, large-area metalens with excellent broadband imaging performance, showing partial cancelling of chromatic dispersion when used in a hybrid configuration with a BaF$_2$ refractive lens. Our work opens new avenues for infrared meta-optics designs and double-side meta-optics fabrication through a production-ready technique which can be directly translated into scalable technology for real-world applications.</p>

            <p>Silicon dominates electronics, optoelectronics, photovoltaics and photonics thanks to its suitable properties, abundance, and well-developed cost-effective manufacturing processes. Recently, crystalline silicon has been demonstrated to be an appealing alternative plasmonic material, both for the infrared where free-carrier plasmons are enabled by heavy doping, and for the ultraviolet where plasmonic effects are induced by interband transitions. Herein, we demonstrate that nanostructured amorphous silicon exhibits such so-called interband plasmonic properties in the ultraviolet, as opposed to the expectation that they would only arise in crystalline materials. We report optical plasmon resonances in the 100-to-300 nm wavelength range in ultrathin nanostructures. These resonances shift spectrally with the nanostructure shape and the nature of the surrounding matrix, while their field enhancement properties turn from surface plasmonic to epsilon-near-zero plasmonic. We present a vacuum ultraviolet wavelength- and polarization-selective ultrathin film absorber design based on deeply-subwavelength anisotropically-shaped nanostructures. These findings reveal amorphous silicon as a promising material platform for ultracompact and room-temperature-processed ultraviolet plasmonic devices operating down to vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths, for applications including anticounterfeiting, data encryption and storage, sensing and detection. Furthermore, these findings raise a fundamental question on how plasmonics can be based on amorphous nanostructures.</p>

We illustrate our approach using selected chiral quasi-1D lattices. Our findings provide a route to flat band state preparation via quench dynamics while preserving the structure of the flat band.</p>

The use of such decorrelators allow us to investigate the interplay of the competing effects of viscous dissipation and nonlinearity. We obtain a precise value of $\alpha = 0.59 \pm 0.04$ and show that departure from the Kolmogorov mean field result $\lambda \propto \sqrt{\rm Re}$ is a consequence of the intermittent fluctuations in the velocity-gradient tensor. The robustness of our results are further confirmed in a local, dynamical systems model for turbulence.</p>

            <p>The liquid-vapor transition is a classic example of a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition. Such transitions underlie many phenomena in cosmology, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed-matter physics. They give rise to long-lived metastable states, whose decay can be driven by either thermal or quantum fluctuations. Yet, direct experimental observations of how these states collapse into a stable phase remain elusive in the quantum regime. Here, we use a trapped-ion quantum simulator to observe the real-time dynamics of ``bubble nucleation'' induced by quantum fluctuations. Bubbles are localized domains of the stable phase which spontaneously form, or nucleate, and expand as the system is driven across a discontinuous quantum phase transition. Implementing a mixed-field Ising spin model with tunable and time-dependent interactions, we track the microscopic evolution of the metastable state as the Hamiltonian parameters are varied in time with various speeds, bringing the system out of equilibrium. Site-resolved measurements reveal the emergence and evolution of finite-size quantum bubbles, providing direct insight into the mechanism by which the metastable phase decays. We also identify nonequilibrium scaling behavior near the transition, consistent with a generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our results demonstrate the power of quantum simulators to probe out-of-equilibrium many-body physics, including quantum bubble nucleation, a key feature of discontinuous quantum phase transitions, with application to studies of matter formation in the early universe.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michalis Chatzittofi, Ramin Golestanian, Jaime Agudo-Canalejo</p>
            <p>The dynamics of many nanoscale biological and synthetic systems such as enzymes and molecular motors are activated by thermal noise, and driven out-of-equilibrium by local energy dissipation. Because the energies dissipated in these systems are comparable to the thermal energy, one would generally expect their dynamics to be highly stochastic. Here, by studying a thermodynamically-consistent model of two coupled noise-activated oscillators, we show that this is not always the case. Thanks to a novel phenomenon that we term topological phase locking (TPL), the coupled dynamics become quasi-deterministic, resulting in a greatly enhanced average speed of the oscillators. TPL is characterized by the emergence of a band of periodic orbits that form a torus knot in phase space, along which the two oscillators advance in rational multiples of each other. The effectively conservative dynamics along this band coexists with the basin of attraction of the dissipative fixed point. We further show that TPL arises as a result of a complex, infinite hierarchy of global bifurcations. Our results have implications for understanding the dynamics of a wide range of systems, from biological enzymes and molecular motors to engineered nanoscale electronic, optical, or mechanical oscillators.</p>

            <p>In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered dipole-octupole pyrochlore magnet Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ is a promising three-dimensional quantum spin liquid candidate which shows no signs of ordering at low temperature. The low energy effective pseudospin-1/2 description in a magnetic field is characterized by the XYZ Hamiltonian and a Zeeman term where the dipolar local $z$-component of the pseudospin couples to the local $z$-component of the applied magnetic field, while the local $x$- and $y$-components of the pseudospin remain decoupled as a consequence of their octupolar character. Using effective Hamiltonian parameters determined in V. Poree et al., arXiv:2305.08261 (2023), remarkable experimental features can be reproduced, as for instance the specific heat and magnetization data as well as the continuum of states seen in neutron scattering. Here we investigate the thermodynamic response to magnetic fields applied along the global [110] direction using specific heat measurements and fits using numerical methods, and solve the corresponding magnetic structure using neutron diffraction. Specific heat data in moderate fields are reproduced well, however, at high fields the agreement is not satisfactory. We especially observe a two-step release of entropy, a finding that demands a review of both theory and experiment. We address it within the framework of three possible scenarios, including an analysis of the crystal field Hamiltonian not restricted to the two-dimensional single-ion doublet subspace. We conclusively rule out two of these scenarios and find qualitative agreement with a simple model of field misalignment with respect to the crystalline direction. We discuss the implications of our findings for [111] applied fields and for future experiments on Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and its sister compounds.</p>

            <p>Fundamentally understanding the lattice dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites remains elusive, primarily due to their strong anharmonicity and frequent phase transitions. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the thermal transport behavior in cubic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3, integrating first principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics with a linearized Wigner transport formula. The Temperature Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) technique allows us to stabilize the negative soft modes, primarily dominated by organic cations, at finite temperatures in cubic FAPbI3. We then predict an ultra-low thermal conductivity of ~0.63 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) in cubic FAPbI3 at 300 K, with a temperature dependence of T^(-0.740), suggesting a good crystalline nature of phonon transport. Notably, the ultra-low thermal conductivity in cubic FAPbI3 is primarily attributed to the [PbI3]1- units, challenging the conventional focus on organic FA+ cations. This shift in focus is due to the presence of Pb(s)-I(p) anti-bonding sates within the [PbI3]1- units. Furthermore, thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 is predominantly governed by the particle-like phonon propagation channel across the entire temperature range of 300-500 K, a result of diminished suppression of low-frequency phonons by FA+ cations and large inter-branch spacings. Finally, our findings underscore that the anharmonic force constants are highly temperature-sensitive, leading to underestimations of thermal conductivity when relying on 0-K anharmonic force constants. Our study not only elucidates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 but also provides a crucial framework for the discovery, design, and understanding of hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with ultra-low thermal conductivity.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the widely used plasma analogy is unreliable at predicting edge properties of quantum Hall states. This discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference between quantum Hall droplets and plasmas (Coulomb gases): the former are incompressible liquids subject to area-preserving deformations, while the latter are governed by electrostatics and thus involve conformal transformations. Consequently, the plasma analogy fails at the edge, except in fine-tuned geometries, as it does not account for the emergent local edge velocity. We quantitatively show how the analogy's failure affects physical quantities, such as fluctuations of local observables and absorption rates in microwave spectroscopy, measurable in both solid-state experiments and quantum simulators.</p>

Their topological orders are inherited from the two SPT orders of the cluster model. The transformations of particles under reflection, translation, and time reversal are derived. In the open chain, four zero-energy parafermionic edge modes are identified, and their structure is analyzed. For the closed system, the boundaries are twisted by the total parafermion parity. It is shown that the open chain is reflection-invariant when the number of spins is even, and $\mathcal{PT}$-invariant when the number of spins is odd. Meanwhile, the closed model exhibits a symmetry characterized by an antiunitary analog of the dihedral group.</p>

            <h2>Mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michalis Chatzittofi, Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</p>

            <p>Here, we evaluate multislice electron ptychography as a tool to carry out depth-resolved atomic resolution characterization of point defects, using silicon carbide as a case study. Through multislice electron scattering simulations and multislice ptychographic reconstructions, we investigate the phase contrast arising from individual silicon vacancies, antisite defects, and a wide range of substitutional transition metal dopants (V\textsubscript{Si} to W\textsubscript{Si}) and potential detectability. Simulating defect types, positions, and microscope conditions, we show that isolated point defects can be located within a unit cell along the sample's depth. The influence of electron energy, dose, defocus, and convergence semi-angle is also explored to determine their role in governing defect contrast. These results guide experiments aiming to analyze point defects with multislice electron ptychography.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for Active Field Theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Kjøllesdal Johnsrud, Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is a defining property of non-equilibrium systems, such as active matter, which is composed of units that consume energy. We employ a formalism that allows us to derive a class of identities associated with the time-reversal transformation in non-equilibrium field theories, in the spirit of Ward-Takahashi identities. We present a generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for active systems as a particular realization of such an identity, and consider its implications and applications for a range of active field theories. The field theoretical toolbox developed here helps to quantify the degree of non-equilibrium activity of complex systems exhibiting collective behavior.</p>

            <h2>High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weilun Jiang, Gaopei Pan, Zhe Wang, Bin-Bin Mao, Heng Shen, Zheng Yan</p>
            <p>The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). Here, $N$ is the total number of sites and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature or projection length. To tackle this problem, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. We benchmark the developed algorithm by calculating the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model. The obtained phase diagram including Fermi surface and Goldstone modes validates the correctness of the algorithm. Remarkably, our method shows the high-efficiency with respect to the existing algorithms, while keeping the high computation precision. We proceed to apply this algorithm to explore the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy and particularly its derivative at Gross-Neveu criticality. Our results elucidate that such critical behavior can be quantified by the correlation length exponent.</p>

            <p>A series of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 (Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5; x = 0 to 0.3) bulks are prepared by conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas pressure and high temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) methods. These bulks are well characterized by structural and microstructural analysis, Raman spectroscopy, transport, and magnetic measurements. The HP-HTS process of the parent bulks has enhanced the onset transition temperature (Tconset) by 1.5 K and the critical current density (Jc) by two orders of magnitude compared to the CSP method. Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 up to 10% doping content prepared, either CSP or HP-HTS, slightly increases the unit cell volume, and high-pressure growth produces an almost pure superconducting phase, which confirms the successful Pr-doping at Fe sites. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations suggest the substitution of Pr-atoms in the interlayer spacing of Fe(Se,Te) lattice. High-pressure growth of Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5 also makes the sample less dense compared to the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Transport and magnetic measurements depict that Tconset is almost unaffected by Pr-doping, whereas Jc of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 is enhanced by one order of magnitude relative to the parent sample developed by CSP but lower than that of the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Hence, Pr- doping at Fe sites preserves Tconset and improves Jc of FeSe0.5Te0.5 regardless of the doping contents and growth conditions. These results are promising for the practical application of iron-based superconductors to improve Jc properties without affecting Tconset through CSP process and congruent with discoveries from other superconductors, like cuprates and MgB2.</p>

            <h2>Permutation Entropy for the Characterization of the Attractive Hamiltonian Mean-Field Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melissa Fuentealba, Danilo M. Rivera, Roberto E. Navarro</p>
            <p>The Hamiltonian Mean-Field (HMF) model is a long-range interaction model that exhibits quasi-stationary states associated with a phase transition. Its quasi-stationary states with a lifetime diverging with the number of particles in the system. These states are characterized by homogeneous or non-homogeneous structures in phase-space. There exists a phase-transition between these states that have been traditionally characterized by the their mean magnetization. However, the magnetization also exhibits fluctuations in time around its mean value, that can be an indicator of the kind of quasi-stationary state. Thus, we want to characterize the quasi-stationary states of the HMF model through the time-series of the magnetization and its fluctuations through a measure of information, i.e. the permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane. Permutation entropy is a measure for characterizing chaotic time series, especially in the presence of dynamic and observational noise, as it is computationally and conceptually simple. For non-homogeneous states, the permutation entropy shows that the HMF model tends towards order, while the magnetizacion fluctuations reveal reduced structures in time. On the contrary, homogeneous states tend to disorder and the structures of the magnetization fluctuations increase as the initial magnetization is larger. In all the study cases of this thesis, the HMF model is characterized by low entropy values but the highest possible complexity value. Thus, the HMF model can be described as a chaotic, deterministic and intermitent system. This aligns with previous studies of the model in the phase space. The results demonstrate that the HMF model can be understood and interpreted from the fluctuations of magnetization using permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane.</p>

            <p>The h-BCN is an intriguing material system where the bandgap varies considerably depending on the atomic configuration, even at a fixed composition. Exploring stable atomic configurations in this system is crucial for discussing the energetic formability and controllability of desirable configurations. In this study, this challenge is tackled by combining first-principles calculations with Bayesian optimization. An encoding method that represents the configurations as vectors, while incorporating information about the local atomic environments, is proposed for the search. Although the optimization did not function with the conventional one-hot encoding that had been effective in other material systems, the proposed encoding proved efficient in the search. As a result, two interesting semiconductor configurations were discovered. These configurations exhibit qualitatively similar patterns to conventional models, and one of the two is more stable than the conventional ones with the same periodicity. Furthermore, the optimization behavior is discussed through principal component analysis, confirming that the ordered BN network and the C configuration features are well embedded in the search space. The proposed encoding method, which is easy to implement, is expected to expand the applicability of atomic configuration search using Bayesian optimization to a broader range of material systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hsuan Lo, You Wang, Rimi Banerjee, Baile Zhang, Y. D. Chong</p>
            <p>Interacting or nonlinear lattices can host emergent particle-like modes, such as Bogoliubov quasiparticles, whose band topology and other properties are potentially highly tunable. Despite originating in the study of superconducting materials, Bogoliubov quasiparticles can also occur in synthetic metamaterials. Here, we implement a nonlinear driven-dissipative circuit whose fluctuations are Bogoliubov modes possessing nontrivial non-Hermitian band topology. We show experimentally that the system exhibits a switchable non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which abruptly appears when the on-site driving voltage amplitude exceeds a threshold. In contrast to earlier realizations of the NHSE and related phenomena in circuit models, the switchable NHSE in our system occurs in Bogoliubov modes, which are strongly affected by how the system is driven. Moreover, unlike other experimental platforms hosting non-Hermitian Bogoliubov modes, our system does not contain unconventional asymmetric hopping nonlinearities, only a local Kerr-type nonlinearity.</p>

            <p>Mixed anion halide-chalcogenide materials have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, making them promising candidates for various applications. Among these, CuBiSeCl_2 has recently been experimentally identified with remarkably low lattice thermal conductivity (k_L). In this study, we employ Wigner transport theory combined with neuroevolution machine learning potential (NEP)-assisted self-consistent phonon calculations to unravel the microscopic origins of this low k_L. Our findings reveal that the delocalization and weak bonding of copper atoms are key contributors to the strong phonon anharmonicity and wavelike tunneling (random walk diffusons). These insights deepen our understanding of the relationship between bonding characteristics, anharmonicity, delocalization, and vibrational dynamics, paving the way for the design and optimization of CuBiSeCl_2 and analogous materials for advanced phonon engineering applications.</p>

            <p>Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_{3}$, STO) stands out as a promising material for various electronic applications thanks to its exceptional dielectric properties. Molecular beam epitaxy is one of the few techniques which allows epitaxial growth of STO directly on industry-relevant silicon substrates. However, maintaining precise stoichiometry and high crystalline quality in this process remains a significant challenge. Establishing this is essential to obtain STO with bulk-like dielectric properties and to minimize leakage current and optical absorbance. In this study, the importance of cationic stoichiometry and the effect of thickness are investigated for STO thin films epitaxially grown on silicon. We employed real-time reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) as a feedback loop mechanism to counteract Sr source oxidation and maintain a constant flux. Additionally, high-temperature post-growth annealing treatments in O$_{2}$ were investigated to promote layer relaxation and reduce oxygen vacancy concentration, thereby improving the physical, electrical, and optical properties of stoichiometric STO. As a result, high-quality STO thin films exceeding 100 nm were successfully fabricated featuring a bulk-like out-of-plane lattice parameter and refractive index, as well as rocking curve full width at half maximum below 0.2°, smooth surface (R$_{q}$ < 0.2 nm) and a leakage current density below 1E-7 A/cm$^{2}$.</p>

            <p>We consider the effect of bending-strain in thin films of clean, conventional superconductors (S), and the proximity-induced effect of this strain in SN bilayers with a normal metal (N), and SNS junctions with equal curvatures in each superconductor. We find that the effective spin-orbit coupling due to strain in the superconductor induces both spin-polarized and unequal-spin even-frequency p-wave triplet pairings throughout the superconductor. When interfaced with a normal metal, additional odd-frequency pairings are induced, and their magnitudes can be tuned with the strain. In SNS junctions, the strain alone can induce a superconducting spin current in the junction. The spin-polarized current can undergo a $0-\pi$-transition, resulting in an in-plane, strain-induced magnetization that switches sign as a function of the strain. We discuss the underlying physics and its implications for superconducting spintronics.</p>

            <p>Anderson localization describes disorder-induced phase transitions, distinguishing between localized and extended states. In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions. However, the corresponding multifractal-enriched mobility edges and three-state-coexisting quantum phases have yet to be experimentally detected. In this work, we propose exactly-solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models that simultaneously host three-state-coexisting quantum phases, with their phase boundaries analytically derived via Avila's global theorem. Furthermore, we propose experimental protocols via Rydberg atom arrays to realize these states. Notably, we demonstrate a spectroscopic technique capable of measuring inverse participation ratios across real-space and dual-space domains, enabling simultaneous characterization of localized, extended, and multifractal quantum phases in systems with up to tens of qubits. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems.</p>

            <p>In geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, weak interactions or slight changes to the structure can tip the delicate balance of exchange interactions, sending the system into a different ground state. Brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, has a copper sublattice composed of distorted triangles, making it a likely host for frustrated magnetism, but exhibits stacking disorder. The lack of synthetic single crystals has limited research on the magnetism in brochantite to powders and natural mineral crystals. We grew crystals which we find to be a new polytype with a tendency toward ABAC stacking and some anion disorder, alongside the expected stacking disorder. Comparison to previous results on natural mineral specimens suggests that cation disorder is more deleterious to the magnetism than anion and stacking disorder. Our specific heat data suggest a double transition on cooling into the magnetically ordered state.</p>

            <p>The concept of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) has been established as a fundamental theory for the understanding of one-dimensional quantum systems. Originally formulated as a replacement for Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, which accurately predicts the behaviour of most 3D metals but fails dramatically in 1D, the TLL description applies to a even broader class of 1D systems,including bosons and anyons. After a certain number of theoretical breakthroughs, its descriptive power has now been confirmed experimentally in different experimental platforms. They extend from organic conductors, carbon nanotubes, quantum wires, topological edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators to cold atoms, Josephson junctions, Bose liquids confined within 1D nanocapillaries and spin chains. In the ground state of such systems, quantum fluctuations become correlated on all length scales, but, counter-intuitively, no long-range order exists. In this respect, this review will illustrate the validity of conformal field theory for describing real-world systems, establishing the boundaries for its application and, on the other side will discuss the spectacular demonstration of how the quantum-critical TLL state governs the properties of many-body systems in one dimension.</p>

            <p>We used our developed AI search engine~(InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. A cubic structure Li$_2$AuH$_6$ with Au-H octahedral motifs is identified to be a candidate. After performing thermodynamical analysis, we provide a feasible route to experimentally synthesize this material via the known LiAu and LiH compounds under ambient pressure. The further first-principles calculations suggest that Li$_2$AuH$_6$ shows a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) $\sim$ 140 K under ambient pressure. The H-1$s$ electrons strongly couple with phonon modes of vibrations of Au-H octahedrons as well as vibrations of Li atoms, where the latter is not taken seriously in other previously similar cases. Hence, different from previous claims of searching metallic covalent bonds to find high-$T_c$ superconductors, we emphasize here the importance of those phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). And we suggest that one can intercalate atoms into binary or ternary hydrides to introduce more potential phonon modes with strong EPC, which is an effective approach to find high-$T_c$ superconductors within multicomponent compounds.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a new nonlinear topology optimization framework which employs porohyperelasticity for providing computational design of pneumatic soft actuators. Density-based topology optimization is used with the objective of maximizing the bending response in a soft actuator made of an elastomer, for given actuation pressure and external resistance. Pressurization of interconnected cavities is modeled via an extension of the Darcy flow theory that is valid for large deformations. Essential for the good performance of the framework is a carefully chosen interpolation scheme for the permeability between void and solid regions, as well as a suitable definition of a drainage term in the solid regions. Results are shown for a variety of actuation pressure and maximum allowable strain energy density levels, covering a wide range of system responses from small to rather large deformations.</p>

The wave function and the spectrum of the system are derived analytically, with the spectrum consisting of Landau levels modified by an additional term associated with the linear Stark effect, proportional to a complex constant $\lambda$. It is shown that this constant arises from an operator $\hat{\Pi}$ that commutes with the Hamiltonian, i.e., $\hat{\Pi}$ is a symmetry of the system. Finally, the Hall conductivity for the lowest Landau level is calculated, showing that it remains exactly equal to the inverse of Klitzing's constant despite the perturbation.</p>

We utilize the connection between correlations and the fluctuations of time-integrated density functionals and generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys.

We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments.

            <p>Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.</p>

            <p>KTaO3 single crystals with different orientations are used as substrates for the epitaxial growth of thin films and/or as hosts for two-dimensional electron gases. Due to the polar nature of the KTaO3(001) surface, one can expect difficulties and challenges to arise in its preparation. Maintaining good insulating characteristics without adding undesirable in-gap electronic states, obtaining good crystalline order up to the top surface layer, a sufficiently flat surface, and complete cleanliness of the surface (without water, C or OH contaminants), are in general difficult conditions to accomplish simultaneously. Cleaving in vacuum is likely the best option for obtaining a clean surface. However, since KTaO3 is cubic and lacks a well-defined cleavage plane, this method is notsuitable for sample growth or reproducible device fabrication. Here, we systematically evaluate the effect of typical preparation methods applied on the surfaces of KTaO3(001) single crystals. In particular, we used annealing in vacuum at different temperatures, light sputtering with Ar+ ions at low energy (500 eV) followed by annealing, heavy Ar+ ion bombardment and annealing, and grazing Ar+ ion bombardment under continuous azimuthal rotation combined with both annealing in vacuum and in O2 atmosphere. Possible side effects after each treatment are evaluated by a combination of techniques, including low-energy ion scattering at forward angles, Auger electron spectroscopy, low-energy electron energy loss, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and time of flightsecondary ion mass spectrometry. Advantages and shortcomings of each preparation method are discussed in detail.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhumita Kabiraj, Raka Dasgupta</p>
            <p>We study the finite and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid (NF). In contrast, the insulating phases that survive at high temperatures in the presence of disorder are the Bose glass and the normal fluid. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</p>

The CGAA-FF model employs grain embedding to encode atomistic coordinates into nodes representing grains rather than individual atoms, enabling predictions of both grain-level energies and atom-level forces. Tested on organic electrolytes, CGAA-FF achieves root-mean-square errors of 4.96 meV atom-1 for energy and 0.201 eV A-1 for force predictions. CGAA-FF significantly reduces computational costs, achieving about 22- and 14-fold improvements in simulation speed and memory efficiency, respectively, compared to the all-atom potential (SevenNet-0). Since this CGAA framework can be integrated into any equivariant architecture, we believe this work opens the door to efficient all-atom simulations of soft-matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry constrained field theories for chiral spin liquid to spin crystal transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anjishnu Bose, Andrew Hardy, Naren Manjunath, Arun Paramekanti</p>
            <p>We consider the spin rotationally invariant Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (CSL) in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry and explore symmetry constraints on possible conventional spin crystal states accessible via a direct transition. These constraints provide a framework to identify topological invariants of the magnetically ordered state. We show that the existence of a direct transition from a CSL requires a precise compatibility condition between the topological invariants of the ordered state and the anomaly of the CSL. The lattice symmetries also constrain the functional form of the low-energy theory to describe these transitions. This allows us to construct explicit Chern-Simons-matter field theories for the transition into a class of noncoplanar orders identified as candidates directly accessible from the CSL, including the octahedral spin crystal on the kagomé lattice, and the tetrahedral order on the triangular and honeycomb lattice. These transitions can either be described using coupled fractionalized $ \mathbb{CP}^1 $ theories or fractionalized matrix principal chiral models. We also discuss extensions to more general magnetic ordering transitions out of the CSL.</p>

            <h2>Accelerated escape dynamics in non-Markovian stochastic feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Coghi, Romain Duvezin, John S. Wettlaufer</p>
            <p>We study the escape dynamics of a non-Markovian stochastic process with time-averaged feedback, which we model as a one-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process wherein the drift is modified by the empirical mean of its trajectory. This process maps onto a class of self-interacting diffusions. Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we derive the most probable escape paths and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean escape time, and show that the feedback accelerates escape by storing finite-time fluctuations thereby lowering the effective energy barrier, and shifting the optimal escape time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic escape trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate escape. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control escape dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Finite Membrane Thickness Influences Hydrodynamics on the Nanoscale</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary G. Lipel, Yannick A. D. Omar, Dimitrios Fraggedakis</p>
            <p>Many lipid membrane-mediated transport processes--such as mechanically-gated channel activation and solute transport--involve structural and dynamical features on membrane thickness length scales. Most existing membrane models, however, tend to adopt (quasi-)two-dimensional descriptions that neglect thickness-dependent phenomena relevant to internal membrane mechanics, and thus do not fully account for the complex coupling of lipid membranes with their surrounding fluid media. Therefore, explicitly incorporating membrane thickness effects in lipid membrane models will enable a more accurate description of the influence of membrane/fluid coupling on transport phenomena in the vicinity of the bilayer surfaces. Here, we present a continuum model for membrane fluctuations that accounts for finite membrane thickness and resolves hydrodynamic interactions between the bilayer and its surrounding fluid. By applying linear response analysis, we observe that membrane thickness-mediated effects, such as bending-induced lipid reorientations, can generate shear flows close to the membrane surface that slow down the relaxation of nanometer scale shape fluctuations. Additionally, we reveal the emergence of pressure inversion and flow reversal near the membrane interfaces, accompanied by localized stagnation points. Among these, extensional stagnation points give rise to a novel mode of bulk dissipation, originating from bending-induced compression and expansion of the membrane surfaces and their coupling to shear stresses in the fluid. Our findings identify membrane thickness as a key factor in nanoscale hydrodynamics and suggest that its effects may be detectable in fluctuation spectra and can be relevant to interfacial processes such as solute permeability and contact with solid boundaries or other membranes.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Bauschinger Effect in Active Ultrastable Glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rashmi Priya, Smarajit Karmakar</p>
            <p>Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.</p>

            <p>We define an action of the Weyl group W of a simple Lie algebra g on a completion of the ring Y, which is the codomain of the q-character homomorphism of the corresponding quantum affine algebra U_q(g^). We prove that the subring of W-invariants of Y is precisely the ring of q-characters, which is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional representations of U_q(g^). This resolves an old puzzle in the theory of q-characters. We also identify the screening operators, which were previously used to describe the ring of q-characters, as the subleading terms of simple reflections from W in a certain limit. Our results have already found applications to the study of the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of U_q(g^) in arXiv:2312.13256 and to the categorification of cluster algebras in arXiv:2401.04616.</p>

            <h2>Phase transitions in in vivo or in vitro populations of spiking neurons belong to different universality classes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Braden A. W. Brinkman</p>
            <p>The "critical brain hypothesis" posits that neural circuitry may be tuned close to a "critical point" or "phase transition" -- a boundary between different operating regimes of the circuit. The renormalization group and theory of critical phenomena explain how systems tuned to a critical point display scale invariance due to fluctuations in activity spanning a wide range of time or spatial scales. In the brain this scale invariance has been hypothesized to have several computational benefits, including increased collective sensitivity to changes in input and robust propagation of information across a circuit. However, our theoretical understanding of critical phenomena in neural circuitry is limited because standard renormalization group methods apply to systems with either highly organized or completely random connections. Connections between neurons lie between these extremes, and may be either excitatory (positive) or inhibitory (negative), but not both. In this work we develop a renormalization group method that applies to models of spiking neural populations with some realistic biological constraints on connectivity, and derive a scaling theory for the statistics of neural activity when the population is tuned to a critical point. We show that the scaling theories differ for models of in vitro versus in vivo circuits -- they belong to different "universality classes" -- and that both may exhibit "anomalous" scaling at a critical balance of inhibition and excitation. We verify our theoretical results on simulations of neural activity data, and discuss how our scaling theory can be further extended and applied to real neural data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Vossel, Bert L. de Groot, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.</p>

In this paper, we propose the diffusion process derived from Smoluchowski equation that can manifest the evolution of memory effect integration in non Markovian regime. The master equation from the Smoluchowski picture, within the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics, justifies the use of the diffusion process. The numerical experiments using collision between semiflexible polymers like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) confirm the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the correlated momentum between two Hamiltonians that compose coarse grained system of SWCNT. The diffusion process governs the nonlinear motion in both equilibrium and far from equilibrium states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Orlando A. Mendible, Jonathan K. Whitmer, Yamil J. Colón</p>
            <p>Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) promise to accurately describe the potential energy surface of molecules at the ab initio level of theory with improved computational efficiency. Within MLFFs, equivariant graph neural networks (EQNNs) have shown great promise in accuracy and performance and are the focus of this work. The capability of EQNNs to recover free energy surfaces (FES) remains to be thoroughly investigated. In this work, we investigate the impact of collective variables (CVs) distribution within the training data on the accuracy of EQNNs predicting the FES of butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). A generalizable workflow is presented in which training configurations are generated with classical molecular dynamics simulations, and energies and forces are obtained with ab initio calculations. We evaluate how bond and angle constraints in the training data influence the accuracy of EQNN force fields in reproducing the FES of the molecules at both classical and ab initio levels of theory. Results indicate that the model's accuracy is unaffected by the distribution of sampled CVs during training, given that the training data includes configurations from characteristic regions of the system's FES. However, when the training data is obtained from classical simulations, the EQNN struggles to extrapolate the free energy for configurations with high free energy. In contrast, models trained with the same configurations on ab initio data show improved extrapolation accuracy. The findings underscore the difficulties in creating a comprehensive training dataset for EQNNs to predict FESs and highlight the importance of prior knowledge of the system's FES.</p>

            <h2>Viscoelastic Worthington jets & droplets produced by bursting bubbles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayush K. Dixit, Alexandros Oratis, Konstantinos Zinelis, Detlef Lohse, Vatsal Sanjay</p>
            <p>Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</p>

            <p>The benefit of exchange-only qubits compared to other spin qubit types is the universal control using only voltage controlled exchange interactions between neighboring spins. As a compromise, qubit operations have to be constructed from non-orthogonal rotation axes of the Bloch sphere and result in rather long pulsing sequences. This paper aims to develop a faster implementation of single-qubit and two-qubit gates using simultaneous exchange pulses. We introduce pulse sequences in which single-qubit gates could be executed faster and show that subsequences on three spins in two-qubit gates could be implemented in fewer steps. Our findings can particularly speed up gate sequences for realistic idle times between sequential pulses and we show that this advantage increases with more interconnectivity of the quantum dots. We further demonstrate how a phase operation can introduce a relative phase between the computational and some of the leakage states, which can be advantageous for the construction of two-qubit gates. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize a simultaneous exchange implementation of $X$ rotations in a SiGe quantum dot device and compare to the state of the art with sequential exchange pulses.</p>

            <p>Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.</p>

            <p>Solutions of the wave equations for time-independent disordered media can exhibit Anderson localization where instead of wave propagation we observe their localization around different points in space. Photonic time crystals are spatially homogeneous media in which the refractive index changes periodically in time, leading to the formation of bands in the wave number domain. By analogy to Anderson localization in space, one might expect that the presence of temporal disorder in photonic time crystals would lead to Anderson localization in the time domain. Here, we show that indeed periodic modulations of the refractive index with the addition of temporal disorder lead to Anderson localization in time, where an electromagnetic field can emerge from the temporally modulated medium at a certain moment in time and then decay exponentially over time. Thus, we are dealing with a situation where, in a fluctuating three-dimensional medium, the birth and death of waves can occur, and the mechanism of this phenomenon corresponds to Anderson localization.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Detection of Strong-To-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking via the Rényi-1 Correlator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zack Weinstein</p>
            <p>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) has recently emerged as a universal feature of quantum mixed-state phases of matter. While various information-theoretic diagnostics have been proposed to define and characterize SWSSB phases, relating these diagnostics to observables which can be efficiently and scalably probed on modern quantum devices remains challenging. Here we propose a new observable for SWSSB in mixed states, called the Rényi-1 correlator, which naturally suggests a route toward scalably detecting certain SWSSB phases in experiment. Specifically, if the canonical purification (CP) of a given mixed state can be reliably prepared, then SWSSB in the mixed state can be detected via ordinary two-point correlation functions in the CP state. We discuss several simple examples of CP states which can be efficiently prepared on quantum devices, and whose reduced density matrices exhibit SWSSB. The Rényi-1 correlator also satisfies several useful theoretical properties: it naturally inherits a stability theorem recently proven for the closely related fidelity correlator, and it directly defines SWSSB as a particular pattern of ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking in the CP state.</p>

We analyze various quantities to verify that the oscillatory dynamics is physical and not a mathematical artefact. We also show that the maximum squeezing diminishes with increasing squeezing order, rendering the squeezing mechanism increasingly ineffective. Our results provide important rules that can help guide the development of more effective higher-order squeezing techniques.</p>

We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta < 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta > 1$.</p>

            <p>We explore the critical properties of the localization transition in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model with quasiperiodic and Stark potentials, where the non-Hermiticity comes from the nonreciprocal hopping. The localization length, the inverse participation ratio and the energy gap are adopted as the characteristic quantities. We perform the scaling analysis to derive the scaling functions of the three quantities with critical exponents in several critical regions, with respect to the quasiperiodic and Stark potentials and the nonreciprocal strength. We numerically verify the finite-size scaling forms and extract the critical exponents in different situations. Two groups of new critical exponents for the non-Hermitian AAS model and its pure Stark limit are obtained, which are distinct to those for the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre model and their Hermitian counterparts. Our results indicate that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian AAS, Aubry-Andre, and Stark models belong to different universality classes. We demonstrate that these critical exponents are independent of the nonreciprocal strength, and remain the same in different critical regions and boundary conditions. Furthermore, we establish a hybrid scaling function with a hybrid exponent in the overlap region between the critical regions for the non-Hermitian AAS and Stark models.</p>

            <p>The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-Rényi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes with conformal field theory predictions.</p>

Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state</p>

            <h2>Beyond Robertson-Schrödinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gen Kimura, Aina Mayumi, Hiromichi Ohno, Jaeha Lee, Dariusz Chruściński</p>
            <p>We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</p>

            <h2>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Near-Critical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Zhang, Hanteng Wang, Wenjun Zhang, Yuqing Wang, Angrui Du, Ziqi Li, Yujia Wu, Chengshu Li, Jiazhong Hu, Hui Zhai, Wenlan Chen</p>
            <p>The Kibble-Zurek scaling reveals the universal dynamics when a system is linearly ramped across a symmetry-breaking phase transition. However, in reality, inevitable finite-size effects or symmetrybreaking perturbations can often smear out the critical point and render the phase transition into a smooth crossover. In this letter, we show experimentally that the precise Kibble-Zurek scaling can be retained in the near-critical crossover regime, not necessarily crossing the critical point strictly. The key ingredient to achieving this near-critical Kibble-Zurek scaling is that the system size and the symmetry-breaking field must be appropriately scaled following the variation of ramping speeds. The experiment is performed in a reconfigurable Rydberg atom array platform, where the Rydberg blockade effect induces a Z2 symmetry-breaking transition. The atom array platform enables precise control of the system size and the zigzag geometry as a symmetry-breaking field. Therefore, we can demonstrate notable differences in the precision of the Kibble-Zurek scaling with or without properly scaling the system size and the zigzag geometry. Our results strengthen the Kibble-Zurek scaling as an increasingly valuable tool for investigating phase transition in quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <p>Magnetic van der Waals materials are an important building block to realize spintronic functionalities in heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Yet, establishing their magnetic and electronic properties and the interrelationship between the magnetic ground state and electronic structure is often challenging because only a limited number of techniques can probe magnetism and electronic structure on length scales of tens to hundreds of nanometers. Chromium chalcogenides are a class of 2D magnetic materials for which a rich interplay between structure and magnetism has been predicted. Here, we combine angle-resolved photoemission and quasi-particle interference imaging to establish the electronic structure of a monolayer of CrTe$_2$ on graphite. From a comparison of model calculations with spectroscopic mapping using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy we establish the magnetic ground state and the low energy electronic structure. We demonstrate that the band structure of monolayer CrTe$_2$ is captured well by density functional theory (DFT) in a DFT+U framework when a Coulomb repulsion of $U=2.5\mathrm{eV}$ is accounted for.</p>

            <h2>An Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Microwave Polarization Switch Implemented with Directed Surface Acoustic Waves in a Magnonic Crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raisa Fabiha, Erdem Topsakal, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>The ability to switch the polarization of a transmitted electromagnetic wave from vertical to horizontal, or vice versa, is of great technological interest because of its many applications in long distance communication. Binary bits can be encoded in two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted securely from point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Consequently, most research in this area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short (~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the wavelength is much larger (typically > 1 cm). That makes a microwave ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, we report such a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an "artificial magnonic crystal". A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with suitable electrodes excites spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, resulting in radiation of electromagnetic waves via magnon-photon coupling. The polarization of the beam radiated in a given direction at a given frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by changing the direction of SAW propagation in the substrate to implement the polarization switch.</p>

            <p>Dynamics of exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensate is examined by means of the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation including non-Markovian coupling to the excitonic reservoir. Attention is concentrated on properties of the condensate lattice created by laser beams providing incoherent pumping of the reservoir. It is shown that phase ordering of the lattice depends on temperature. The crossover between the in-phase (``ferromagnetic'') and the checkboard (``antiferromagnetic'') orders is accompanied by variation of the steady-state condensate density. Also it is shown that the condensate lattices can retain ordered pattern for temperatures which are much higher than the critical temperature of a single spot, probably due to suppression of the modulational instability.</p>

            <h2>Coulomb Interaction-Stabilized Isolated Narrow Bands with Chern Numbers $\mathcal{C} > 1$ in Twisted Rhombohedral Trilayer-Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vo Tien Phong, Cyprian Lewandowski</p>
            <p>Recently, fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects have been discovered in two-dimensional moiré materials when a topologically nontrivial band with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$ is partially doped. Remarkably, superlattice Bloch bands can carry higher Chern numbers that defy the Landau-level paradigm and may even host exotic fractionalized states with non-Abelian quasiparticles. Inspired by this exciting possibility, we propose twisted \textit{rhombohedral} trilayer-bilayer graphene at $\theta \sim 1.2^\circ$ as a field-tunable quantum anomalous Chern insulator that features spectrally-isolated, kinetically-quenched, and topologically-nontrivial bands with $\mathcal{C} = 2,3$ favorable for fractional phases once fractionally doped, as characterized by their quantum geometry. Based on extensive self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that these phases are stabilized by Coulomb interactions and are robust against variations in dielectric environment, tight-binding hopping parameters, and lattice relaxation.</p>

            <p>We report the new observation of several high partial-wave (HPW) magnetic Feshbach resonances (FRs) in $^{39}$K atoms of the hyperfine substate $\left|F=1,m_{F}=-1\right\rangle$. These resonances locate at the region between two broad $s$-wave FRs from 32.6 G to 162.8 G, in which Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) can be produced with tunable positive scattering length obtained by magnetic FRs. These HPW FRs are induced by the dipolar spin-spin interaction with s-wave in the open channel and HPW in the closed channel. Therefore, these HPW FRs have distinct characteristics in temperature dependence and loss line shape from that induced by spin-exchange interaction with HPWs in both open and closed channels. Among these resonances, one $d$-wave and two $g$-wave FRs are confirmed by the multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT) calculation. The HPW FRs have significant applications in many-body physics dominated by HPW pairing.</p>

This state demonstrates protected existence across a broad region in parametric space, and exhibits a non-2{\pi}-period but 4{\pi}-period-compatible energy-phase relation. Our study suggests that TI-based Josephson junctions, as proposed in the Fu-Kane scheme of TQC, may provide a promising platform for hosting and braiding MZMs.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polaritons - hybrid light-matter quasiparticles - can undergo Bose-Einstein-like condensation at elevated temperatures owing to their lower effective mass. This becomes even more pronounced in the context of molecular polariton condensates where the large exciton binding energy of Frenkel excitons facilitates condensation at room temperature. While widely studied as low-threshold coherent light sources, the dynamics of their condensation remain poorly understood, partly due to the limitations of existing kinetic models. Here, we use excitation correlation photoluminescence (ECPL), a nonlinear optical technique with 220fs resolution, to probe molecular polariton condensation in Rhodamine-B-doped small-molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES). This platform promotes dipole alignment and suppresses detrimental intermolecular interactions. ECPL reveals condensate formation within hundreds of femtoseconds, driven by radiative scattering from the reservoir. A sustained population beyond the polariton lifetime suggests an additional feeding mechanism from higher momentum states in the lower polariton dispersion. These results provide quantitative insight into condensation timescales and mechanisms, advancing our control over polariton dynamics.</p>

            <p>Ultracold dipolar molecules hold great promise for the creation of novel quantum states of matter, but the realization of long-lived molecular bulk samples with strong dipole-dipole interactions has remained elusive. Here, we realize a collisionally stable gas of ultracold ground state molecules with a lifetime of several seconds. Utilizing double microwave dressing, we achieve an extreme suppression of inelastic two- and three-body losses by factors of more than 10,000 and 1,000, respectively. We find that losses remain suppressed across a wide range of dipole-dipole interactions, allowing the continuous tuning of the dipolar length from 0 to 1 um $\sim$ 20,000 $a_0$. Combined with the recent realization of Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules, our findings open the door to the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum liquids.</p>

            <h2>Exotic Carriers from Concentrated Topology: Dirac Trions as the Origin of the Missing Spectral Weight in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick J. Ledwith, Ashvin Vishwanath, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The nature of charge carriers in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near $\nu = -2$, where superconductivity emerges, remains mysterious. While various symmetry-broken ground states have been proposed, experimental evidence of significant entropy persisting to low temperatures suggests that the disordered thermal state is a more natural starting point for understanding the normal state physics. Our previous work proposed that this thermal state in TBG hosts nearly decoupled nonlocal moments and an exotic Mott semimetal at charge neutrality. This evolves into a spectrally imbalanced Mott state at non-zero integer fillings. Notably, at $\nu = -2$, the quasiparticle residue vanishes at the top of the valence band, precisely where superconductivity develops. The vanishing quasiparticle residue naturally leads to the following question: Which excitation accounts for the missing spectral weight, and how are they related to electrons? In this work, we demonstrate that the missing spectral weight corresponds to a trion excitation, which we explicitly construct and characterize. Remarkably, despite being composed of heavy particles away from the Gamma point, this trion is unexpectedly light. At charge neutrality, the electron and trion hybridize with a momentum-dependent phase that winds around zero, forming a massless Dirac cone. At finite doping $\nu < 0$, the Dirac cone acquires a mass with the valence (conduction) band becoming trion (electron)-like near the $\Gamma$ point. Finally, we show that such trion excitations evolve into the quasiparticles of the intervalley Kekulé spiral (IKS) state at finite doping, where they represent electrons dressed by the IKS order parameter. More broadly, our work highlights the unusual spectral properties and excitations that emerge when fermions interact within topological bands with concentrated quantum geometry and topology.</p>

            <h2>$C^\ast$-categorical prefactorization algebras for superselection sectors and topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Benini, Victor Carmona, Pieter Naaijkens, Alexander Schenkel</p>
            <p>This paper presents a conceptual and efficient geometric framework to encode the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors of an algebraic quantum field theory on the $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. It is shown that, under certain assumptions which are implied by Haag duality, the monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of localized superselection sectors carry the structure of a locally constant prefactorization algebra over the category of cone-shaped subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing techniques from higher algebra, one extracts from this datum an underlying locally constant prefactorization algebra defined on open disks in the cylinder $\mathbb{R}^1\times\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. While the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ arises geometrically as the angular coordinates of cones, the origin of the line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is analytic and rooted in Haag duality. The usual braided (for $n=2$) or symmetric (for $n\geq 3$) monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of superselection sectors are recovered by removing a point of the sphere $\mathbb{R}^1\times(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\setminus\mathrm{pt}) \cong\mathbb{R}^n$ and using the equivalence between $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and locally constant prefactorization algebras defined on open disks in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-trivial homotopy groups of spheres induce additional algebraic structures on these $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal $C^\ast$-categories, which in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is given by a braided monoidal self-equivalence arising geometrically as a kind of `holonomy' around the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$. The locally constant prefactorization algebra structures discovered in this work generalize, under some mild geometric conditions, to other discrete spaces and thereby provide a clear link between the geometry of the localization regions and the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors.</p>

            <p>Chromonics are special classes of nematic liquid crystals, for which a quartic elastic theory seems to be more appropriate than the classical quadratic Oseen-Frank theory. The relaxation dynamics of twist director profiles are known to develop a shock wave in finite time in the inviscid case, where dissipation is neglected. This paper studies the dissipative case. We give a sufficient criterion for the formation of shocks in the presence of dissipation and we estimate the critical time at which these singularities develop. Both criterion and estimate depend on the initial director profile. We put our theory to the test on a class of initial kink profiles and we show how accurate our estimates are by comparing them to the outcomes of numerical solutions.</p>

Graphene was chosen for its biocompatibility and high surface area, enabling efficient antigen adsorption, validated by techniques such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Changes in Raman bands (a $\sim 10~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ shift in the 2D band and an increase in the $I_D/I_G$ ratio from 0.03 to 0.60) confirmed non-covalent interactions and enhanced surface coverage with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Tests using human plasma (10 RT-PCR-positive and 10 negative samples) demonstrated a clear distinction between groups using graphene sensors functionalized with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) validation corroborated the results. Optimization of protein concentration and biofunctionalization time highlighted the importance of homogeneous surface coverage for reproducibility of the graphene-based ME biosensor. The platform combines graphene's advantages with the wireless, real-time detection capabilities of ME sensors, offering low cost, high sensitivity, and potential for automation, with applications in point-of-care diagnostics.</p>

            <p>Micro-swimmer locomotion in heterogeneous media is increasingly relevant in biological physics due to the prevalence of microorganisms in complex environments. A model for such porous media is the Brinkman fluid which accounts for a sparse matrix of stationary obstacles via a linear resistance term in the momentum equation. We investigate two models for the locomotion and the flow field generated by a swimmer in such a medium. First, we analyze a dumbbell swimmer composed of two spring-connected spheres and driven by a flagellar force and derive its exact swimming velocity as a function of the Brinkman medium resistance, showing that the swimmer monotonically slows down as the medium drag monotonically increases. In the limit of no resistance the model reduces to the classical Stokes dipole swimmer, while finite resistance introduces hydrodynamic screening that attenuates long-range interactions. Additionally, we derive an analytical expression for the far-field flow generated by a Brinkmanlet force-dipole, which can be used for propulsive point-dipole swimmer models. Remarkably, this approximation reproduces the dumbbell swimmer's flow field in the far-field regime with high accuracy. These results provide new analytical tools for understanding locomotion in complex fluids and offer foundational insights for future studies on collective behavior in active and passive suspensions within porous or structured environments.</p>

These bursts severely degrade qubit coherence for a prolonged period of time and can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allowed us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of a few. This modest reduction falls several orders of magnitude short of the reduction expected if the quasiparticles quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.</p>

            <p>A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a lattice quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We optimize the algorithm with tensor networks in one and two dimensions. The optimization has two stages. In stage one, a shallow translationally-invariant circuit is optimized in an infinite lattice. In stage two, the infinite-lattice gate sequence is used as a starting point for a finite lattice where it remains optimal in the bulk. The prepared state requires optimization only at its boundary, within a healing length from lattice edges, and the gate sequence needs to be modified only within the causal cone of the boundary. We test the procedure in the 1D and 2D quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point employing, respectively, the matrix product state (MPS) and the pair-entangled projected state (PEPS). At the boundary already the infinite-lattice sequence turns out to provide a more accurate state than in the bulk.</p>

Minimal models of continuous stochastic and quantum clocks have been proposed to explore fundamental limitations on the performance of timekeeping devices. Owing to the level of complexity in the clock structure and its energy consumption, such devices show trade-offs whose characterization remains an open challenge. Indeed, even conceptual designs for thermodynamically efficient quantum clocks are not yet well understood. In condensed matter theory, time-crystals were found as an exciting new phase of matter, featuring oscillations in (pseudo)-equilibrium with first experimental observations appearing recently. This naturally prompts the question: \textit{can time crystals be used as quantum clocks and what is their performance from a thermodynamic perspective?} We answer this question and find that quantum crystals are indeed genuine quantum clocks with a performance enhanced by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry.</p>

By combining effective model analysis and first-principles calculations, we propose that the synergy among inversion symmetry breaking, flat bands, and saddle point-related van Hove singularities within the kagome lattice holds significant potential for generating strong second-order nonlinear optical response. This property provides an inspiring insight into the practical application of the kagome-like materials, which is helpful for a comprehensive understanding of kagome lattice-related physics. Moreover, this work offers an alternative approach for designing materials with strong a second-order nonlinear optical response.</p>

            <h2>Multireference error mitigation for quantum computation of chemistry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Zou, Erika Magnusson, Hampus Brunander, Werner Dobrautz, Martin Rahm</p>
            <p>Quantum error mitigation (QEM) strategies are essential for improving the precision and reliability of quantum chemistry algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Reference-state error mitigation (REM) is a cost-effective chemistry-inspired QEM method that performs exceptionally well for weakly correlated problems. However, the effectiveness of REM is often limited when applied to strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce multireference-state error mitigation (MREM), an extension of REM that systematically captures quantum hardware noise in strongly correlated ground states by utilizing multireference states. A pivotal aspect of MREM is using Givens rotations to efficiently construct quantum circuits to generate multireference states. To strike a balance between circuit expressivity and noise sensitivity, we employ compact wavefunctions composed a few dominant Slater determinants. These truncated multireference states, engineered to exhibit substantial overlap with the target ground state, can effectively enhance error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolver experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MREM through comprehensive simulations of molecular systems $\mathrm{H_2O, ~N_2, ~and ~F_2}$, underscoring its ability to realize significant improvements in computational accuracy compared to the original REM method. MREM broadens the scope of error mitigation to encompass a wider variety of molecular systems, including those exhibiting pronounced electron correlation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sare Khoshdooni, Komeil Babaei Velni, M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar</p>
            <p>We study the capacity of entanglement in certain integrable scale-invariant theories which exhibit Lifshitz scaling symmetry with a generic dynamical exponent z at the critical point. This measure characterizes the width of the eigenvalue spectrum of the reduced density matrix and is a quantum informational counterpart of heat capacity. We explore various aspects of capacity of entanglement, such as the corresponding universal terms for the ground state, its z-dependence and also its temporal evolution after a global quantum quench in two dimensions. We carefully examine the existence of a convenient entropic c-function based on this quantity both in bosonic and fermionic theories. While in the relativistic case the corresponding c-function displays a monotonic behavior under the RG flow, this is not the case for the nonrelativistic theories. We also investigate the dynamics of capacity of entanglement after a mass quench and show that it follows the quasiparticle interpretation for the spreading of entanglement. Finally, we discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including the entanglement entropy.</p>

            <h2>Engineering long-range and multi-body interactions via global kinetic constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Runmin Wu, Bing Yang, Pieter W. Claeys, Hongzheng Zhao</p>
            <p>Long-range and multi-body interactions are crucial for quantum simulation and quantum computation. Yet, their practical realization using elementary pairwise interactions remains an outstanding challenge. We propose an experimental scheme based on the Bose-Hubbard system with a periodic driving of the on-site energy and global-range density-density interactions, a setup readily implementable via cold atoms in optical lattices with cavity-mediated interactions. Optimally chosen driving parameters can induce global kinetic constraints, where tunneling rates are selectively suppressed depending on the particle number imbalance between all even and odd sites. This mechanism, together with the flexible tunability of local tunneling rates, provides efficient implementation schemes of a family of global controlled gates for quantum computation. We illustrate this scheme for the $N$-qubit Toffoli gate, circumventing the need for a two-body gate decomposition, and elaborate on the efficient preparation of entangled many-body states.</p>

We quantify the strength of molecular interactions over six orders of magnitude in affinity constant, and track reactions in real-time. Highly parallel measurements on individual molecules serve to characterize sample-state heterogeneity at the highest resolution, offering predictive input to model three-dimensional structure.

            <p>We report on the test of a small scale, non-planar coil using non-insulated ReBCO tape wound on a 3D-printed aluminum support structure. A 3D-scan of the winding frame which was printed out of AlSi10Mg using selective laser melting, showed peak manufacturing deviations of 0.3 mm. We tested the coil with 21 turns of 3 mm wide tape cooled both by liquid nitrogen and with a cryocooler. We achieved a central field strength of up to 21 mT which agrees with the prediction suggesting that we manufactured the coil without defects. The peak field was reached at a supply current of 120 A. The current leads showed a contact resistance of $\left(2.25\pm0.13\right)\mu\Omega$. The discharge time $L/R$ was found to be 0.63 s in liquid nitrogen and 2.92 s when cooled by the cryocooler.

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) marry inorganic nodes, organic edges, and topological nets into programmable porous crystals, yet their astronomical design space defies brute-force synthesis. Generative modeling holds ultimate promise, but existing models either recycle known building blocks or are restricted to small unit cells. We introduce Building-Block-Aware MOF Diffusion (BBA MOF Diffusion), an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that learns 3D all-atom representations of individual building blocks, encoding crystallographic topological nets explicitly. Trained on the CoRE-MOF database, BBA MOF Diffusion readily samples MOFs with unit cells containing 1000 atoms with great geometric validity, novelty, and diversity mirroring experimental databases. Its native building-block representation produces unprecedented metal nodes and organic edges, expanding accessible chemical space by orders of magnitude. One high-scoring [Zn(1,4-TDC)(EtOH)2] MOF predicted by the model was synthesized, where powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and N2 sorption confirm its structural fidelity. BBA-Diff thus furnishes a practical pathway to synthesizable and high-performing MOFs.</p>

            <p>Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces, making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations. This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36\% to 52\%. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approximately 20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for addressing data scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven machine learning.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Transmutation and Anomaly Matching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Seiberg, Sahand Seifnashri</p>
            <p>We explore a situation where a global symmetry of the ultraviolet (UV) theory does not act faithfully on the local infrared (IR) degrees of freedom, but instead acts effectively as a higher-form symmetry. We refer to this phenomenon as symmetry transmutation, where the UV symmetry is "transmuted" into a higher-form symmetry in the IR. Notably, unlike emergent (accidental) symmetries, which are approximate, these symmetries are exact. We illustrate the ubiquity of this phenomenon in various continuum and lattice systems and provide examples where the 't Hooft anomalies of the UV symmetry are matched by those of the new higher-form symmetry in the IR. We also show that in certain phases and for certain energies, the UV baryon-number symmetry of one-flavor QCD is transmuted into a discrete one-form global symmetry. Finally, we compare our symmetry transmutation to the well-known phenomenon of symmetry fractionalization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiale Huang, Xiangjian Qian, Zhendong Li, Mingpu Qin</p>
            <p>Matchgates and Clifford circuits are two types of quantum circuits which can be efficiently simulated classically, though the underlying reasons are quite different. Matchgates are essentially the single particle basis transformations in the Majorana fermion representation which can be easily handled classically, while the Clifford circuits can be efficiently simulated using the tableau method according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. In this work, we propose a new wave-function ansatz in which matrix product states are augmented with the combination of Matchgates and Clifford circuits (dubbed MCA-MPS) to take advantage of the representing power of all of them. Moreover, the optimization of MCA-MPS can be efficiently implemented within the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Our benchmark results on one-dimensional hydrogen chain show that MCA-MPS can improve the accuracy of the ground-state calculation by several orders of magnitude over MPS with the same bond dimension. This new method provides us a useful approach to study quantum many-body systems. The MCA-MPS ansatz also expands our understanding of classically simulatable quantum many-body states.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate experimentally that the bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm on IBM's 156-qubit devices can outperform simulated annealing (SA) and CPLEX in time-to-approximate solutions for specific higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. We suitably select problem instances that are challenging for classical methods, running in fractions of minutes even with multicore processors. On the other hand, our counterdiabatic quantum algorithms obtain similar or better results in at most a few seconds on quantum hardware, achieving runtime quantum advantage. Our analysis reveals that the performance improvement becomes increasingly evident as the system size grows. Given the rapid progress in quantum hardware, we expect that this improvement will become even more pronounced, potentially leading to a quantum advantage of several orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that available digital quantum processors, when combined with specific-purpose quantum algorithms, exhibit a runtime quantum advantage even in the absence of quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>When electrons moving in two-dimensions (2D) are subjected to a strong uniform magnetic field, they form flat bands called Landau levels, which are the basis for the quantum Hall effect. Landau levels can also arise from pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) induced by lattice distortions; for example, mechanically straining graphene causes its Dirac quasiparticles to form a characteristic set of unequally-spaced Landau levels, including a zeroth Landau level. In three-dimensional (3D) systems, there has thus far been no experimental demonstration of Landau levels or any other type of flat band. For instance, applying a uniform magnetic field to materials hosting Weyl quasiparticles, the 3D generalizations of Dirac quasiparticles, yields bands that are non-flat in the direction of the field. Here, we report on the experimental realization of a flat 3D Landau level in an acoustic crystal. Starting from a lattice whose bandstructure exhibits a nodal ring, we design an inhomogeneous distortion corresponding to a specific pseudomagnetic vector potential (PVP) that causes the nodal ring states to break up into Landau levels, with a zeroth Landau level that is flat along all three directions. These findings point to the possibility of using nodal ring materials to generate 3D flat bands, to access strong interactions and other interesting physical regimes in 3D.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered by an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</p>

In order to accurately determine $\lambda$, we performed complementary measurements using the frequency of superconducting $LC$ resonators as well as the resistance of normal-state meanders. Both methods yield comparable results, providing a well-characterized set of values of $\lambda$ in aluminum in the relevant range for applications in fields such as quantum computing and microwave radiation detector technologies.</p>

            <h2>Summation of Divergent Series and Quantum Phase Transitions in Kitaev Chains with Long-Range Hopping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Fu, Peiqing Tong</p>
            <p>We study the quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in extended Kitaev chains with long-range ($1/r^{\alpha}$) hopping. Formally, there are two QPT points at $\mu=\mu_0(\alpha)$ and $\mu_\pi(\alpha)$ ($\mu$ is the chemical potential) which correspond to the summations of $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}m^{-\alpha}$ and $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{m-1}m^{-\alpha}$, respectively. When $\alpha\leq0$, both the series are divergent and it is usually believed that no QPTs exist. However, we find that there are two QPTs at $\mu=\mu_0(0)$ and $\mu_\pi(0)$ for $\alpha=0$ and one QPT at $\mu=\mu_\pi(\alpha)$ for $\alpha<0$. These QPTs are second order. The $\mu_0(0)$ and $\mu_\pi(\alpha\leq0)$ correspond to the summations of the divergent series obtained by the analytic continuation of the Riemann $\zeta$ function and Dirichlet $\eta$ function. Moreover, it is found that the quasiparticle energy spectra are discontinue functions of the wave vector $k$ and divide into two branches. This is quite different from that in the case of $\alpha>0$ and induces topological phases with the winding number $\omega:=\pm1/2$. At the same time, the von Neumann entropy are power law of the subchain length $L$ no matter in the gapped region or not. In addition, we also study the QPTs, topological properties, and von Neumann entropy of the systems with $\alpha>0$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pradip Kattel, Abay Zhakenov, Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Patrick Azaria, Natan Andrei</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians capture several aspects of open quantum systems, such as dissipation of energy and non-unitary evolution. An example is an optical lattice where the inelastic scattering between the two orbital mobile atoms in their ground state and the atom in a metastable excited state trapped at a particular site and acting as an impurity, results in the two body losses. It was shown in \cite{nakagawa2018non} that this effect is captured by the non-Hermitian Kondo model. which was shown to exhibit two phases depending on the strength of losses. When the losses are weak, the system exhibits the Kondo phase and when the losses are stronger, the system was shown to exhibit the unscreened phase where the Kondo effect ceases to exist, and the impurity is left unscreened. We re-examined this model using the Bethe Ansatz and found that in addition to the above two phases, the system exhibits a novel $\widetilde{YSR}$ phase which is present between the Kondo and the unscreened phases. The model is characterized by two renormalization group invariants, a generalized Kondo temperature $T_K$ and a parameter `$\alpha$' that measures the strength of the loss. The Kondo phase occurs when the losses are weak which corresponds to $0<\alpha<\pi/2$. As $\alpha$ approaches $\pi/2$, the Kondo cloud shrinks resulting in the formation of a single particle bound state which screens the impurity in the ground state between $\pi/2<\alpha<\pi$. As $\alpha$ increases, the impurity is unscreened in the ground state but can be screened by the localized bound state for $\pi<\alpha<3\pi/2$. When $\alpha>3\pi/2$, one enters the unscreened phase where the impurity cannot be screened. We argue that in addition to the energetics, the system displays different time scales associated with the losses across $\alpha=\pi/2$, resulting in a phase transition driven by the dissipation in the system.</p>

Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p>

            <p>The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</p>

            <p>We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.</p>

            <p>Fractional excitations hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and quantum technologies. However, constructing lattice models for their dynamics under gauge fields remains a formidable challenge due to inherent obstructions. Here, we introduce a novel and systematic framework for deriving low-energy lattice models of fractional orbitals coupled to tight-binding gauge fields. Departing from conventional geometric approaches, our method systematically eliminates the high-energy states via virtual hopping, thereby deriving the gauge potential and quantum metric through a superexchange-like mechanism. We demonstrate the framework by constructing Wannier orbitals for Majorana states and a tight-binding $Z_2$ gauge field across various flux crystalline phases in the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice. Our study reveals a striking phase transition between two non-trivial topological phases characterized by gapless flat-band with extensive degeneracy. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting Majorana orbitals, leading to a correlation-induced fractional Chern state. Our work establishes a general framework for gauge-mediated tight-binding models and a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting fractional orbitals that can be readily extended to $U(1)$, $SU(N)$ lattice gauge theories.</p>

            <p>Advanced semiconductor manufacturing offers a promising path to scaling up silicon-based quantum processors by improving yield, uniformity, and integration. Individual spin qubit control and readout have been demonstrated in quantum dots fabricated on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm natural silicon MOS process customised for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the exchange interaction, forming the basis for entangling gates such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We measure gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns with a quality factor of 10. For readout, we introduce a novel dispersive readout technique, the radio-frequency electron cascade, that simplifies the qubit unit cell while providing high gain. This method achieves a signal-to-noise ratio of 6 within an integration time of 46 ${\mu}$s, the highest-performing dispersive readout demonstration in a planar MOS process. The combination of sensitive dispersive readout with industrial-grade manufacturing marks a crucial step towards large-scale integration of silicon quantum processors.</p>

            <p>The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop InvDesFlow, an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for the discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing InvDesFlow, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ (at 5 GPa) and B$_5$CN$_2$ (at ambient pressure) whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</p>

            <h2>Data-driven stochastic 3D modeling of the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery cathodes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Phillip Gräfensteiner, Markus Osenberg, André Hilger, Nicole Bohn, Joachim R. Binder, Ingo Manke, Volker Schmidt, Matthias Neumann</p>
            <p>A stochastic 3D modeling approach for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by a Boolean model with spherical grains. The model parameters are calibrated to 3D image data of cathodes in lithium-ion batteries acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, model validation is performed by comparing model realizations with measured image data in terms of various morphological descriptors that are not used for model fitting. Finally, we use the stochastic 3D model for predictive simulations, where we generate virtual, yet realistic, image data of nanoporous binder-conductive additives with varying amounts of graphite particles. Based on these virtual nanostructures, we can investigate structure-property relationships. In particular, we quantitatively study the influence of graphite particles on effective transport properties in the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase, which have a crucial impact on electrochemical processes in the cathode and thus on the performance of battery cells.</p>

            <h2>Charge and spin properties of a generalized Wigner crystal realized in the moiré WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrzej Biborski, Michał Zegrodnik</p>
            <p>We examine the charge and spin properties of an effective single-band model representing a moiré superlattice of the WSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$ heterobilayer. We focus on the $2/3$ electron filling, which refers to the formation of a generalized Wigner crystal, as evidenced experimentally. Our approach is based on the extended-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with non-interacting part effectively describing a spin-split band due to Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. We investigate the system in the regime of strong on-site Coulomb repulsion and the ground state of the Hamiltonian is obtained with the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group formulated within the Matrix Product State approach. According to our analysis, based on the density-density correlation functions resolved in the momentum space, a transition from the metallic to the insulating state appears with increasing intersite electron-electron interactions. This transition is identified as being concomitant with the emergence of a generalized Wigner crystal that realizes the honeycomb lattice pattern. We investigate the magnetic properties of such a Wigner crystal state and find that the presence of spin-valley polarization and the increased intersite repulsion induce spin canting of the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering.</p>

            <p>Acoustic haptic technology adds touch sensations to human-machine interfaces by integrating piezoelectric actuators onto touchscreens. Traditional piezoelectric haptic technologies use opaque lead-containing ceramics that are both toxic and visible. We have developed a highly transparent lead-free piezoelectric haptic device using potassium sodium niobate (KNN) and transparent conductive oxide thin films. The KNN film, grown on glass, exhibits a pure perovskite phase and a dense microstructure. This device achieves up to 80% transmittance, surpassing lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films. It generates an acoustic resonance at 16.5 kHz and produces a peak-to-peak displacement of 1.0 um at 28 V unipolar, making it suitable for surface rendering applications. This demonstrates the potential of transparent lead-free piezoelectric actuators as an effective alternative to conventional PZT haptic actuators.</p>

            <p>As "2D" materials (i.e. materials just a few atoms thick) continue to gain prominence, understanding their symmetries is critical for unlocking their full potential. In this work, we present comprehensive tables that tabulate the rod group symmetries of all crystallographic lines in all 80 layer groups, which describe the symmetries of 2D materials. These tables are analogous to the scanning tables for space groups found in Volume E of the International Tables for Crystallography, but are specifically tailored for layer groups and their applications to 2D materials. This resource will aid in the analysis of line defects, such as domain walls, which play a crucial role in determining the properties and functionality of 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiuyang Xia, Yuhan Peng, Ka Ki Li, Ran Ni</p>
            <p>To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</p>

            <h2>Efficient moment tensor machine-learning interatomic potential for accurate description of defects in Ni-Al Alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiantao Wang, Peitao Liu, Heyu Zhu, Mingfeng Liu, Hui Ma, Yun Chen, Yan Sun, Xing-Qiu Chen</p>
            <p>Combining the efficiency of semi-empirical potentials with the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have significantly advanced atomistic modeling in computational materials science and chemistry. This necessitates the continual development of MLIP models with improved accuracy and efficiency, which enable long-time scale molecular dynamics simulations to unveil the intricate underlying mechanisms that would otherwise remain elusive. Among various existing MLIP models, the moment tensor potential (MTP) model employs a highly descriptive rotationally-covariant moment tensor to describe the local atomic environment, enabling the use of even linear regression for model fitting. Although the current MTP model has achieved state-of-the-art efficiency for similar accuracy, there is still room for optimizing the contraction process of moment tensors. In this work, we propose an effective genetic algorithm based optimization scheme that can significantly reduce the number of independent moment tensor components and intermediate tensor components. This leads to a speedup of nearly one order of magnitude in efficiency and also improved accuracy compared to the traditional MTP model for intricate basis sets. We have applied our improved MTP model to predicting the energetic and dynamical properties of various point and planar defects in Ni-Al alloys, showing overall good performances and in general outperforming the semi-empirical potentials. This work paves the way for fast and accurate atomistic modeling of complex systems and provides a useful tool for modeling defects in Ni-Al alloys.</p>

            <h2>Lorentz Skew Scattering and Giant Nonreciprocal Magneto-Transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Xiao, Yue-Xin Huang, Shengyuan A. Yang</p>
            <p>Skew scattering is the well-known dominant mechanism for anomalous Hall transport in highly conductive systems. However, despite extensive research, the primary mechanism governing nonlinear (nonreciprocal) magneto-transport in clean samples remains unknown. This theoretical gap has impeded the development of design principles for efficient nonreciprocal devices. Here, we unveil a hitherto unexplored effect in nonreciprocal magneto-transport from cooperative action of Lorentz force and skew scattering. The significance of this Lorentz skew scattering mechanism lies in that it dominates both longitudinal and transverse responses in highly conductive systems, and it exhibits a scaling behavior distinct from all known mechanisms. At low temperature, it shows a cubic scaling in linear conductivity, whereas the scaling becomes quartic at elevated temperature when phonon scattering kicks in. Applying our developed microscopic theory to surface transport in topological crystalline insulator SnTe and bulk transport in Weyl semimetals leads to significant results, suggesting a new route to achieve giant transport nonreciprocity in high-mobility materials with topological band features.</p>

            <h2>On the breakdown of dimensional reduction and supersymmetry in random-field models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilles Tarjus, Matthieu Tissier, Ivan Balog</p>
            <p>We discuss the breakdown of the Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry (SUSY) and of the dimensional-reduction (DR) property in the random field Ising and O($N$) models as a function of space dimension $d$ and/or number of components $N$. The functional renormalization group (FRG) predicts that this takes place below a critical line $d_{\rm DR}(N)$. We revisit the perturbative FRG results for the RFO($N$)M in $d=4+\epsilon$ and carry out a more comprehensive investigation of the nonperturbative FRG approximation for the RFIM. In light of this FRG description, we discuss the perturbative results in $\epsilon=6-d$ recently derived for the RFIM by Kaviraj, Rychkov, and Trevisani. We stress in particular that the disappearance of the SUSY/DR fixed point below $d_{\rm DR}$ arises as a consequence of the nonlinearity of the FRG equations and cannot be found via the perturbative expansion in $\epsilon=6-d$ (nor in $1/N$). We also provide an error bar on the value of the critical dimension $d_{\rm DR}$ for the RFIM, which we find around $5.11\pm0.09$, by studying several successive orders of the nonperturbative FRG approximation scheme.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofie Castro Holbæk, Mark H. Fischer</p>
            <p>In the $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ $=$ K, Rb, Cs) kagome materials, superconductivity coexists with a charge density wave (CDW), constituting a new platform to study the interplay of these two orders. Despite extensive research, the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter remains disputed, with experiments seemingly supporting different conclusions. As key aspects of the physics might lie in the intertwining of electronic orders, a better understanding of the impact of the CDW on superconductivity is crucial. In this work, we develop a phenomenological framework to study the interplay of superconductivity and CDW order. In particular, we derive a Ginzburg-Landau free energy for both superconducting and CDW order parameters. Given the unclear nature of the superconducting state, we discuss general pairing symmetries with a focus on $s$-wave, $d$-wave, and pair-density-wave order parameters. Motivated by experiments, we consider the additional breaking of time-reversal or point-group symmetries of the CDW and determine in detail the consequences for the superconducting state. Our results show how the superconducting state mimics the broken symmetries of the CDW and can guide future microscopic calculations, as well as the experimental identification of the superconducting state in the $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ compounds.</p>

            <h2>Controlling particle-hole symmetry of fractional quantum hall states in trilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simrandeep Kaur, Harsimran Singh, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Unmesh Ghorai, Manish Jain, Rajdeep Sensarma, Aveek Bid</p>
            <p>We present a detailed experimental study of the particle-hole symmetry (PHS) of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states about half filling in a multiband system. Specifically, we focus on the lowest Landau level of the monolayer-like band of Bernal stacked trilayer graphene (TLG). In pristine TLG, the excitation energy gaps, Landé g-factor, effective mass, and disorder broadening of the odd-denominator FQH states are identical to their hole-conjugate counterpart. This precise PH symmetry stems from the lattice mirror symmetry that precludes Landau-level mixing. Introducing a non-zero displacement field \(D\) disrupts this mirror symmetry, facilitating the hybridization between the monolayer-like and bilayer-like Landau levels. This inter-band coupling enhances the Landau level mixing factor $\eta$ and activates three-body interactions -- both of which explicitly break the PHS of FQHs. As a result, conventional FQHs are completely destabilized, offering a route to engineer symmetry breaking of FQHs in a controlled way. We establish that the PHS breaking in TLG is of extrinsic origin and is fundamentally distinct from the intrinsic, interaction-driven symmetry breaking observed in the lowest Landau levels of single-layer and bilayer graphene.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.</p>

            <h2>General Theory for Group Resetting with Application to Avoidance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juhee Lee, Seong-Gyu Yang, Hye Jin Park, Ludvig Lizana</p>
            <p>We present a general theoretical framework for group resetting dynamics in multi-particle systems in a drift potential. While traditional resetting models typically focus on a single particle, our setup considers a group of particles whose collective dynamics determine the resetting process. More recently, resetting has also been used as a regulatory mechanism to avoid adverse outcomes, such as preventing critically high water levels in dams or deleveraging financial portfolios. Here, we extend current resetting theories to group dynamics, with applications ranging from bacterial evolution under antibiotic pressure to multiple-searcher optimization algorithms. Combining renewal theory and extreme value statistics, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the spatial distribution of the group's center of mass, treated as an effective particle. This formalism allows us to analytically calculate essential observables including the stationary mean position, variance, and a dimensionless measure of risk--the squared coefficient of variation. Our results demonstrate how the group size and resetting rate affect the probability of avoiding the danger region. This theoretical approach opens new perspectives on designing optimal group-level search and avoidance strategies through resetting.</p>

            <h2>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinliang Lyu, Naoki Kawashima</p>
            <p>We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry exploited. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</p>

            <p>Direct-current resistivity is a key probe for the physical properties of materials. In metals, Fermi-liquid (FL) theory serves as the basis for understanding transport. A $T^2$ behavior of the resistivity is often taken as a signature of FL electron-electron scattering. However, the presence of impurity and phonon scattering as well as material-specific aspects such as Fermi surface geometry can complicate this interpretation. We demonstrate how density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory can be used to elucidate the FL regime. We take as examples SrVO$_{3}$ and SrMoO$_{3}$, two moderately correlated perovskite oxides, and establish a precise framework to analyze the FL behavior of the self-energy at low energy and temperature. Reviewing published low-temperature resistivity measurements, we find agreement between our calculations and experiments performed on samples with exceptionally low residual resistivity. This comparison emphasizes the need for further theoretical, synthesis, and characterization developments in these and other FL materials.</p>

            <p>Quantum geometry and topology are fundamental concepts of modern condensed matter physics, underpinning phenomena ranging from the quantum Hall effect to protected surface states. The Berry curvature, a central element of this framework, is well established for its key role in electronic transport, whereas its impact on the optical properties of crystals remains comparatively unexplored. Here, we derive a relation between optical activity, defined by the gyration tensor, and the k-derivatives of the Berry curvature at optical resonances in the Brillouin zone. We systematically determine which of these derivatives are non-zero or constrained by symmetry across all time-reversal-invariant crystal classes. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that circular dichroism emerges in chiral crystal classes as a result of a non-zero Berry curvature k-derivative along the optical axis, and we interpret this finding based on the conservation of angular momentum in light-matter interactions. This work establishes a quantum-geometric framework for optical activity in solids and it opens new routes to probe quantum geometry via linear and nonlinear optics.</p>

We find that with increasing viscosity a plasmon-like mode quickly decays into a broad, incoherent background, while a phonon-like mode with linear dispersion remains rather sharp. The quantitative behavior of the hybridized collective modes depends on the ratio of the electronic and the ionic plasma frequencies. We also show that the direct Coulomb interaction between the ions is essential to obtain a collective sound mode with linear dispersion.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet trilayer sandwiched between two superconductors (S/F/I/F/S heterostructure). It is well-known that a conceptually similar S/F/S system is a platform for implementing ultra-strong magnon-photon coupling. Here, we demonstrate that in such S/F/I/F/S heterostructure, ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling between the two F layers also appears. The strength of this interaction is many times greater than the strength of the usual dipole-dipole interaction. It is mediated via Meissner currents excited in the superconductor layers by the magnon stray fields. The strength of the magnon-magnon coupling is anisotropic, and its anisotropy is opposite to the anisotropy of the magnon-photon coupling, which allows them to be separated. Both couplings become much stronger when the temperature drops below the critical temperature of the superconductor layers. It enables the implementation of an efficient tuning of the wavenumber in the S/F/I/F/S heterostructures controlled by temperature in a wide range of frequencies. Overall, the rich and tunable spectrum of S/F/I/F/S multilayers opens broad prospects for their application in magnonics.</p>

            <p>The symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, or simply the ``gap'', provides certain constraints on the actual mechanism that gives rise to pairing and ultimately to superconductivity. In this work we show how superconducting phases with mixed singlet-triplet symmetries can arise below $T_c$ for a generic tight-binding model. We first examine the 1D case to better illustrate the prevalence of symmetry-breaking transitions below $T_c$, and then the more realistic 2D case. In both cases we illustrate the implication for spectroscopic investigations of the energy gap by calculating the density of states for different temperatures below $T_c$. We find that the structure of the density of states near $T_c$ can vary dramatically from its form near $T=0$. A complete picture of the superconducting symmetry can only be attained if measurements are made over the entire temperature range.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davi Arrais Nobre, Karen C. Abbott, Jonathan Machta, Alan Hastings</p>
            <p>Many ecological populations are known to display a cyclic behavior with period 2. Previous work has shown that when a metapopulation (group of coupled populations) with such dynamics is allowed to interact via nearest neighbor dispersal in two dimensions, it undergoes a phase transition from disordered (spatially asynchronous) to ordered (spatially synchronous) that falls under the 2-D Ising universality class. While nearest neighbor dispersal may satisfactorily describe how most individuals migrate between habitats, we should expect a small fraction of individuals to venture on a journey to further locations. We model this behavior by considering ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small-world networks, in which at each time step a fraction $p$ of the nearest neighbor interactions is replaced by a new interaction with a random node on the network. We measure how this connectivity change affects the critical point for synchronizing ecological oscillators. Our results indicate that increasing the amount of long-range interaction (increasing $p$) favors the ordered regime, but the presence of memory in ecological oscillators leads to quantitative differences in how much long-range dispersal is needed to order the network, relative to an analogous network of Ising spins. We also show that, even for very small values of $p$, the phase transition falls into the mean-field universality class, and argue that ecosystems where dispersal can occasionally happen across the system's length scale will display a phase transition in the mean-field universality class.</p>

Here, we consider short potential barriers/wells modelled by delta-functions. We also generalize our analysis by incorporating tilts in the dispersion. Due to the parabolic nature of the spectra, caused by quadratic-in-momentum dependence, there exist evanescent waves, which decay exponentially as we move away from the junction represented by the location of the delta-function potential. Investigating the possibility of the appearance of bound states, we find that their energies appear as pairs of $\pm |E_b |$, reflecting the presence of the imaginary-valued wavevectors at both positive and negative values of energies of the propagating quasiparticles.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous current-electric field characteristics in transport through a nanoelectromechanical systems</h2>

            <p>A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</p>

            <p>Ice Ih, the most stable phase of water at ambient pressure, is a stacking of the honeycomb network of water molecules H2O. What if one layer of ice is exfoliated and confined to a two-dimensional (2D) sheet? Martyite Zn3(V2O7)(OH)2 2H2O, a mineral with the honeycomb lattice of H2O in the porous framework, is an ideal system for studying such monolayer ice. Due to the geometrical frustration and 2D nature, H2O molecules are dynamically disordered at room temperature. In this study, we reveal disorder-order transitions of H2O in martyite using single-crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD results visualize the formation of hydrogen-bonded toroidal H2O hexamers, leading to the ferroaxial order below 200 K. Combined with the molecular dynamics simulations, we discuss the formation process of the H2O hexamers and how they compromise the molecular arrangement towards lower temperatures. Our results unveil the ground state of monolayer ice, a fundamental knowledge to understand the polymorphism of H2O.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting diode effect in Ising superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Itai Bankier, Lotan Attias, Alex Levchenko, Maxim Khodas</p>
            <p>We study the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in an Ising superconductor with broken basal mirror symmetry in a parallel magnetic field. We show that in the presence of a small Rashba spin splitting, $\Delta_R$, the dominant Ising spin-orbit coupling ($\Delta_I >> \Delta_R$) dramatically enhances the SDE efficiency compared to a Rashba superconductor with $\Delta_I = 0$ and the same $\Delta_R$. The suppression of the SDE for $\Delta_I = 0$ at $\Delta_R$ much larger than the critical temperature ($T_c$) is accidental. At $\Delta_R << T_c$, the SDE efficiency is small because, to linear order, $\Delta_R$ can be removed by a gauge transformation. These two factors -- the accidental suppression of the SDE at large $\Delta_R$ and the systematic suppression at small $\Delta_R$ -- are eliminated by Ising spin-orbit coupling. As a result, SDE efficiency is substantially enhanced for $\Delta_I >> \Delta_R \neq 0$.</p>

            <h2>Martingale approach for first-passage problems of time-additive observables in Markov processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Izaak Neri</p>
            <p>We develop a method based on martingales to study first-passage problems of time-additive observables exiting an interval of finite width in a Markov process. In the limit that the interval width is large, we derive generic expressions for the splitting probability and the cumulants of the first-passage time. These expressions relate first-passage quantities to the large deviation properties of the time-additive observable. We find that there are three qualitatively different regimes depending on the properties of the large deviation rate function of the time-additive observable. These regimes correspond to exponential, super-exponential, or sub-exponential suppression of events at the unlikely boundary of the interval. Furthermore, we show that the statistics of first-passage times at both interval boundaries are in general different, even for symmetric thresholds and in the limit of large interval widths. While the statistics of the times to reach the likely boundary are determined by the cumulants of the time-additive observables in the original process, those at the unlikely boundary are determined by a dual process. We obtain these results from a one-parameter family of positive martingales that we call Perron martingales, as these are related to the Perron root of a tilted version of the transition rate matrix defining the Markov process. Furthermore, we show that each eigenpair of the tilted matrix has a one-parameter family of martingales. To solve first-passage problems at finite thresholds, we generally require all one-parameter families of martingales, including the non-positive ones. We illustrate this by solving the first-passage problem for run-and-tumble particles exiting an interval of finite width.</p>

            <p>Traditional approaches to achieve targeted epitaxial growth involves exploring a vast parameter space of thermodynamical and kinetic drivers (e.g., temperature, pressure, chemical potential etc). This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome to accelerate synthesis and characterization of novel materials with complex dependencies on local chemical environment, temperature and lattice-strains, specifically nanoscale heterostructures of layered 2D materials. We combine the strength of next generation supercomputers at the extreme scale, machine learning and classical molecular dynamics simulations within an adaptive real time closed-loop virtual environment steered by Bayesian optimization to enable asynchronous ensemble sampling of the synthesis space, and apply it to the recrystallization phenomena of amorphous transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer to form stack moiré heterostructures under various growth parameters. We show that such asynchronous ensemble sampling frameworks for materials simulations can be promising towards achieving on-demand epitaxy of van der Waals stacked moiré devices, paving the way towards a robust autonomous materials synthesis pipeline to enable unprecedented discovery of new functionalities.</p>

            <p>The development of numerically efficient computational methods has facilitated in depth studies of various correlated phases of matter including critical and topological phases. A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.</p>

            <h2>Doping lattice non-abelian quantum Hall states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengyan Darius Shi, Carolyn Zhang, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>We study quantum phases of a fluid of mobile charged non-abelian anyons, which arise upon doping the lattice Moore-Read quantum Hall state at lattice filling $\nu = 1/2$ and its generalizations to the Read-Rezayi ($\mathrm{RR}_k$) sequence at $\nu = k/(k+2)$. In contrast to their abelian counterparts, non-abelian anyons present unique challenges due to their non-invertible fusion rules and non-abelian braiding structures. We address these challenges using a Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau (CSGL) framework that incorporates the crucial effect of energy splitting between different anyon fusion channels at nonzero dopant density. For the Moore-Read state, we show that doping the charge $e/4$ non-abelion naturally leads to a fully gapped charge-$2$ superconductor without any coexisting topological order. The chiral central charge of the superconductor depends on details of the interactions determining the splitting of anyon fusion channels. For general $\mathrm{RR}_k$ states, our analysis of states obtained by doping the basic non-abelion $a_0$ with charge $e/(k+2)$ reveals a striking even/odd pattern in the Read-Rezayi index $k$. We develop a general physical picture for anyon-driven superconductivity based on charge-flux unbinding, and show how it relates to the CSGL description of doped abelian quantum Hall states. Finally, as a bonus, we use the CSGL formalism to describe transitions between the $\mathrm{RR}_k$ state and a trivial period-$(k+2)$ CDW insulator at fixed filling, driven by the gap closure of the fundamental non-abelian anyon $a_0$. Notably, for $k=2$, this predicts a period-4 CDW neighboring the Moore-Read state at half-filling, offering a potential explanation of recent numerical observations in models of twisted MoTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>Self-assemblies, structured via nanoparticles, show promise as materials for advanced applications, like photonic devices, electrochemical energy storage units and catalysis support. Despite observing diverse morphologies, a comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we show that the coordination interaction between metal-based sulfide nanoparticles (MS NPs) and the fluorosurfactants at the droplet interface influences the morphology during the evaporation-induced self-assembly facilitated by droplet microfluidics. Further investigation into fluorosurfactants with various chemical groups and MS NPs reveals that the strength of coordination interactions significantly influences assembly morphology. The interfacial interactions can be eliminated through coating a SiO2 layer on the metal-based colloid (M@SiO2 NPs). In addition, we demonstrate that the morphologies of the self-assemblies can be engineered via the coordination interactions between the MS NPs and fluorosurfactants, and by varying the concentrations of MS NPs. Utilizing these interfacial interactions, assemblies with core-shell and homogeneous distribution of binary nanoparticles were constructed. Our findings offer novel insights into the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the droplet interface through evaporation-induced self-assembly, and into the design of metal-based colloidal assemblies with diverse morphologies, crucial for developing novel functional assemblies for catalysis, plasmonic, and porous materials in a controlled manner.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerzy Gorecki, Yuki Koyano, Hiroyuki Kitahata</p>
            <p>A self-propelled motion resulting from the dissipation of camphor molecules on the water surface has been attracting scientific attention for more than 200 years. A generally accepted description of the phenomenon includes equations for the object motion coupled with the hydrodynamics of Marangoni flows and the time evolution of camphor surface concentration. The solution of such equations is a numerically complex problem. In recent publications, an alternative approach based on Hamiltonian including the potential term representing Marangoni interactions has been applied to simulate the time evolution of camphor rotors. Such a model represents a significant numerical simplification if compared to the standard description. Here, we comment on the applicability of Hamiltonian approach by applying it to a single camphor rotor perturbed by a camphor disk fixed on the water surface. We demonstrate that in such a case, the approach leads to the results qualitatively different from the experimental ones. Therefore, we doubt in its applicability to describe the time evolution of interacting camphor rotors. We also show that the approximation of the Marangoni forces by a potential gives more realistic results if used together with the equation of motion that includes the hydrodynamic friction. Still, a better agreement with experiments can be obtained by considering an additional equation for the time evolution of camphor surface concentration.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive investigation into the emergence of interface-bound states, particularly Majorana zero modes (MZMs), in a lateral heterostructure composed of two three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, under the influence of proximity-induced superconductivity from niobium (Nb) contacts. We develop an advanced two-dimensional Dirac model for the topological surface states (TSS), incorporating spatially varying chemical potentials and s-wave superconducting pairing. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism, we derive analytical solutions for the bound states and compute the local density of states (LDOS) at the interface, revealing zero-energy modes characteristic of MZMs. The topological nature of these states is rigorously analyzed through winding numbers and Pfaffian invariants, and their robustness is explored under various physical perturbations, including gating effects. Our findings highlight the potential of this heterostructure as a platform for topological quantum computing, with detailed predictions for experimental signatures via tunneling spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>Crystalline solids with extreme insulation often exhibit a plateau or even an upward-sloping tail in thermal conductivity above room temperature. Herein, we synthesized a crystalline material AgTl$_2$I$_3$ with an exceptionally low thermal conductivity of 0.21 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, which continues to decrease to 0.17 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 523 K. We adopted an integrated experimental and theoretical approach to reveal the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of AgTl$_2$I$_3$. Our results suggest that the Ag-I polyhedron enables extended antibonding states to weaken the chemical bonding, fostering strong lattice anharmonicity driven by the rattling vibrations of Ag atoms and causing lattice softening. Experimental measurements further corroborate the large atomic thermal motions and low sound velocity. These features impede particle-like phonon propagation, and significantly diminish the contribution of wave-like phonon tunneling. This work highlights a strategy for designing thermal insulating materials by leveraging crystal structure and chemical bonding, providing a pathway for advancing the development of thermal insulators.</p>

            <p>Electric-field controls of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) have recently been discussed from the microscopic viewpoint. Since the DMI plays a critical role in generating topological spin textures (TSTs) such as the chiral soliton, the magnetic skyrmion, and the magnetic hedgehog, electric-field controls of these TSTs have become an important issue. This paper shows that such electric-field-induced DMI indeed creates and annihilates TSTs by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for many-body spin systems at finite temperatures. We show that when a strong electric field is applied in a proper way to one- or two-dimensional ferromagnets, the Hamiltonians are changed into the well-known spin models for the chiral soliton or the skyrmion lattice, and the TST states emerge. We utilize a machine-learning method to count the number of generated TSTs. In the three-dimensional (3D) case, we demonstrate the electric-field induction of a magnetic hedgehog structure as follows: Applying a strong enough electric field along a proper direction to a skyrmion-string state (a triple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state) at low but finite temperatures, we find that the field-induced DMI can drive a quadruple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state with hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs. This result indicates that we have succeeded in constructing a simple 3D short-range interacting spin model hosting a magnetic hedgehog structure.</p>

            <p>In two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the inter-particle interaction can lead to the formation of a viscous electron fluid and realization of the hydrodynamic regime of electron transport. Here a nonlinear model of the electron hydrodynamic transport is constructed based on the accounting of pair correlations in the electron dynamics. When describing these systems within the framework of classical kinetics, such correlations represent subsequent ``extended'' collisions of the same electrons temporarily joined into pairs. We study their influence on stationary magnetotransport for large-amplitude fluid flows in long samples. Current profiles in the nonlinear regime and the corresponding differential magnetoresistance are calculated. Pair correlations lead to a characteristic nonmonotonic dependence of the differential resistance on magnetic field. We compare our results with experimental data on magnetoresistance of 2D electrons in high-purity GaAs quantum wells; our model can be responsible for a part of the observed features of the differential magnetoresistance.</p>

            <p>In this work, we revisit the operator-state correspondence in the Majorana conformal field theory (CFT) with emphasis on its semion representation. Whereas the semion representation (or $Z_{2}$ extension of the chiral Ising CFT) gives a concise ``abelian" (or invertible) representation in the level of fusion rule and quantum states, there exists subtlety when considering the chiral multipoint correlation function. In this sense, the operator-state correspondence in the semion sector of the fermionic theory inevitably contains difficulty coming from its anomalous conformal dimension $1/16$ as a $Z_{2}$ symmetry operator. By analyzing the asymptotic behaviors of the existing correlation functions, we propose a nontrivial correspondence between the chiral conformal blocks and bulk correlation functions containing both order and disorder fields. One can generalize this understanding to $Z_{N}$ models or fractional supersymmetric models (in which there exist long-standing open problems). We expect this may improve our understanding of the simple current extension of CFT which can appear commonly in the studies of topologically ordered systems.</p>

            <p>Spectral statistics such as the level spacing statistics and spectral form factor (SFF) are widely expected to accurately identify ``ergodicity'', including the presence of underlying macroscopic symmetries, in generic quantum systems ranging from quantized chaotic maps to interacting many-body systems. By studying various quantizations of maximally chaotic maps that break a discrete classical symmetry upon quantization, we demonstrate that this approach can be misleading and fail to detect macroscopic symmetries. Notably, the same classical map can exhibit signatures of different random matrix symmetry classes in short-range spectral statistics depending on the quantization. While the long-range spectral statistics encoded in the early time ramp of the SFF are more robust and correctly identify macroscopic symmetries in several common quantizations, we also demonstrate analytically and numerically that the presence of Berry-like phases in the quantization leads to spectral anomalies, which break this correspondence. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that long-range spectral rigidity remains directly correlated with ergodicity in the quantum dynamical sense of visiting a complete orthonormal basis.</p>

            <p>Dynamical formation of doublons or onsite repulsively bound pairs of particles on a lattice is a highly non-trivial phenomenon. In this work, we show the signatures of doublon formation in a quantum computer by simulating the continuous time quantum walk in the framework of the one dimensional extended Fermi-Hubbard model. By considering two up-component and one down-component particles initially created at the three neighbouring sites at the middle of the lattice and allowing intra- (inter-) component nearest neighbour (onsite) interactions we show the formation a stable onsite doublon in the quantum walk. The probability of such doublon formation is more (less) if the hopping strength of the down particle is weaker (stronger) compared to the up particle. On the contrary, for an initial doublon along with a free up particle, the stability of the doublon is more prominent than the doublon dissociation in the dynamics irrespective of the hopping asymmetry between the two components. We first numerically obtain the signatures of the stable doublon formation in the dynamics and then observe them using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.</p>

            <p>Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer the potential to accurately model the energy and free energy landscapes of molecules with the precision of quantum mechanics and an efficiency similar to classical simulations. This research focuses on using equivariant graph neural networks MLPs due to their proven effectiveness in modeling equilibrium molecular trajectories. A key issue addressed is the capability of MLPs to accurately predict free energies and transition states by considering both the energy and the diversity of molecular configurations. We examined how the distribution of collective variables (CVs) in the training data affects MLP accuracy in determining the free energy surface (FES) of systems, using Metadynamics simulations for butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). The study involved training forty-three MLPs, half based on classical molecular dynamics data and the rest on ab initio computed energies. The MLPs were trained using different distributions that aim to replicate hypothetical scenarios of sampled CVs obtained if the underlying FES of the system was unknown. Findings for butane revealed that training data coverage of key FES regions ensures model accuracy regardless of CV distribution. However, missing significant FES regions led to correct potential energy predictions but failed free energy reconstruction. For ADP, models trained on classical dynamics data were notably less accurate, while ab initio-based MLPs predicted potential energy well but faltered on free energy predictions. These results emphasize the challenge of assembling an all-encompassing training set for accurate FES prediction and highlight the importance of understanding the FES in preparing training data. The study points out the limitations of MLPs in free energy calculations, stressing the need for comprehensive data that encompasses the system's full FES for effective model training.</p>

            <p>Separating relevant and irrelevant information is key to any modeling process or scientific inquiry. Theoretical physics offers a powerful tool for achieving this in the form of the renormalization group (RG). Here we demonstrate a practical approach to performing Wilsonian RG in the context of Gaussian Process (GP) Regression. We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the GP in which the data sets the IR scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes. Studying such flows may improve our understanding of feature learning in deep neural networks, and enable us to identify potential universality classes in these models.</p>

            <p>Simulating strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature and density is a longstanding challenge in nuclear and high-energy physics that also has fundamental implications for condensed matter physics. In this work, we use minimally entangled typical thermal state (METTS) approaches to facilitate both classical and quantum computational studies of such systems. METTS techniques combine classical random sampling with imaginary time evolution, which can be performed on either a classical or a quantum computer, to estimate thermal averages of observables. We study 1+1-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to spinless fermionic matter, which maps onto a local quantum spin chain. We benchmark both a classical matrix-product-state implementation of METTS and a recently proposed adaptive variational approach that is a promising candidate for implementation on near-term quantum devices, focusing on the equation of state as well as on various measures of fermion confinement. Of particular importance is the choice of basis for obtaining new METTS samples, which impacts both the classical sampling complexity (a key factor in both classical and quantum simulation applications) and complexity of circuits used in the quantum computing approach. Our work sets the stage for future studies of strongly coupled gauge theories with both classical and quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Classical Benchmarks for Variational Quantum Eigensolver Simulations of the Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonios M. Alvertis, Abid Khan, Thomas Iadecola, Peter P. Orth, Norm Tubman</p>
            <p>Simulating the Hubbard model is of great interest to a wide range of applications within condensed matter physics, however its solution on classical computers remains challenging in dimensions larger than one. The relative simplicity of this model, embodied by the sparseness of the Hamiltonian matrix, allows for its efficient implementation on quantum computers, and for its approximate solution using variational algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver. While these algorithms have been shown to reproduce the qualitative features of the Hubbard model, their quantitative accuracy in terms of producing true ground state energies and other properties, and the dependence of this accuracy on the system size and interaction strength, the choice of variational ansatz, and the degree of spatial inhomogeneity in the model, remains unknown. Here we present a rigorous classical benchmarking study, demonstrating the potential impact of these factors on the accuracy of the variational solution of the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, for systems with up to $32$ qubits. We find that even when using the most accurate wavefunction ansätze for the Hubbard model, the error in its ground state energy and wavefunction plateaus for larger lattices, while stronger electronic correlations magnify this issue. Concurrently, spatially inhomogeneous parameters and the presence of off-site Coulomb interactions only have a small effect on the accuracy of the computed ground state energies. Our study highlights the capabilities and limitations of current approaches for solving the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, and we discuss potential future avenues of research.</p>

            <h2>Early-Cycle Internal Impedance Enables ML-Based Battery Cycle Life Predictions Across Manufacturers</h2>

            <p>Predicting the end-of-life (EOL) of lithium-ion batteries across different manufacturers presents significant challenges due to variations in electrode materials, manufacturing processes, cell formats, and a lack of generally available data. Methods that construct features solely on voltage-capacity profile data typically fail to generalize across cell chemistries. This study introduces a methodology that combines traditional voltage-capacity features with Direct Current Internal Resistance (DCIR) measurements, enabling more accurate and generalizable EOL predictions. The use of early-cycle DCIR data captures critical degradation mechanisms related to internal resistance growth, enhancing model robustness. Models are shown to successfully predict the number of cycles to EOL for unseen manufacturers of varied electrode composition with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 150 cycles. This cross-manufacturer generalizability reduces the need for extensive new data collection and retraining, enabling manufacturers to optimize new battery designs using existing datasets. Additionally, a novel DCIR-compatible dataset is released as part of ongoing efforts to enrich the growing ecosystem of cycling data and accelerate battery materials development.</p>

            <h2>Superradiance of Strongly Interacting Dipolar Excitons in Moiré Quantum Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Kumlin, Ajit Srivastava, Thomas Pohl</p>
            <p>Moiré lattices created in two-dimensional heterostructures exhibit rich many-body physics of interacting electrons and excitons and, at the same time, suggest promising optoelectronic applications. Here, we study the cooperative radiance of moiré excitons that is demonstrated to emerge from the deep subwavelength nature of the moiré lattice and the strong excitonic on-site interaction. In particular, we show that the static dipole-dipole interaction between interlayer excitons can strongly affect their cooperative optical properties, suppressing superradiance of disordered states while enhancing superradiance of ordered phases of moiré excitons. Moreover, we show that doping permits direct control of optical cooperativity, e.g., by generating supperradiant dynamics of otherwise subradiant states of excitons. Our results show that interlayer moiré excitons offer a unique platform for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly interacting many-body systems, thus, holding promise for applications in quantum nonlinear optics.</p>

            <p>Scintillators convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons and play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films because of the localized nature of this effect. This study introduces a method to expand the application of nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-sized plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) folds for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_{3}$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling also predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.26 $\pm$ 0.31) and (3.02 $\pm$ 0.69) folds for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate a (2.07 $\pm$ 0.39) fold increase in light yield under $^{241}$Am $\gamma$-excitation. These findings provide a viable pathway for utilizing nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</p>

            <p>Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</p>

            <h2>Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Cataldi</p>
            <p>This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayyed Ahmad Abtahi, Mohsen Maddahali, Ahmad Bakhtafrouz</p>
            <p>The emerging field of topological metasurfaces offers unique advantages, particularly in robustness against backscattering in low-profile structures. The lattice configuration of these structures significantly influences the ability to achieve sharp turns in the propagation path. One of the most studied lattices in condensed matter physics is the kagome lattice, characterized by its hexagonal Brillouin zone, which displays a Dirac cone in its dispersion diagram. Previous research on kagome lattices in photonic topological insulators has primarily focused on valley types of insulators. This article introduces a spin topological metasurface based on the kagome lattice and its unit cell, enabling a broad range of sharp turns and propagation paths. The unit cell is compared to its hexagonal and 60-degree rhombic counterparts, and a parametric study of its dimensions is conducted. As a result of this research, a new X-band leaky-wave antenna designed in the kagome lattice with an armchair arrangement interface has been developed. This antenna provides two forward and two backward beams, each pair achieving an approximately 50-degree scan within the 8.8 to 11.1 GHz bandwidth.</p>

            <h2>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Arpan Saha, Rickmoy Samanta</p>
            <p>Thin cylindrical membranes arise in a wide variety of biological systems ranging from tubular structures on and within cell membranes to in-vitro experiments on artificial vesicles. Motor proteins embedded in such fluidic membranes often induce vortex-like flows. In this work, we construct a class of 2D vortex flow in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to 3D external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincaré Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian, This Hamiltonian also incorporates the specific couplings of the 2D membrane flow with the 3D external fluids. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, such as orbit pinching, For a two-vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time, unlike flat and spherical fluid membranes, where the separation remains constant. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999), now extended to tubular geometries. We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</p>

            <h2>Many-Body Vertex Effects: Time-Dependent Interaction Kernel with Correlated Multi-Excitons in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brian Cunningham</p>
            <p>Building on a beyond-GW many-body framework that incorporates higher-order vertex effects in the self-energy -- giving rise to T-matrix and second-order exchange contributions -- this approach is extended to now include the vertex derived in that work to the kernel in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) for the reducible polarization function. This results in a frequency-dependent interaction kernel that naturally captures random phase approximation (RPA) effects, dynamical excitonic interactions, and the correlated propagation of multiple correlated electron-hole pairs that model multi- (including bi- and tri-) excitonic effects, relevant for nonlinear optics and high harmonic generation. These processes emerge from including the functional derivatives of the screening and vertex with respect to the Green's function in the vertex, enabling a fully abinitio, time-dependent treatment of correlation effects. By focusing on the reducible rather than irreducible polarization function, this approach provides a computationally viable framework for capturing complex many-body interactions for calculating the self-energy, optical spectra and EELS. The resulting interaction kernel is relatively straightforward, clearly delineates the physical processes that are included and omitted, and has the same dimensionality as the conventional BSE kernel used in standard many-body theory implementations, but is now itself frequency dependent. The method is expected to facilitate the integration of advanced many-body effects into state-of-the-art software packages, offering a universal and highly accurate framework for the description of sub-atomic correlations. Such advancements are crucial for the development of semiconductor, optoelectronic, superconducting and antimatter technologies, and ensuring that theoretical modeling evolves alongside exascale and accelerated computing.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer Rényi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.</p>

The circulation of the wave momentum density gives rise to orbital angular momentum (AM). Additionally, for waves described by vector fields, local rotation of the wavefield produces spin AM (or simply, spin). These dynamical wave properties become particularly significant in structured (i.e., inhomogeneous) wavefields. Here we provide an introduction and overview of the momentum and AM properties for a variety of classical waves: electromagnetic, sound, elastic, plasma waves, and water surface waves. A unified field-theory approach, based on Noether's theorem, offers a general framework to describe these diverse physical systems, encompassing longitudinal, transverse, and mixed waves with different dispersion characteristics. We also discuss observable manifestations of the wave momentum and AM providing clear physical interpretations of the derived quantities.</p>

            <p>Surface plasmons or phonons propagating on a two-dimensional (2D) material can exhibit coupling with resonant excitations in its substrate, and the resulting coupled modes were extensively studied. Similar coupling of edge modes propagating along a boundary of 2D material with the substrate excitations remains unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the edge-substrate hybrid modes using the exact Wiener-Hopf analytical approach. We analyze dispersions, decay rate, and confinement of such hybrid modes both without magnetic field (plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon hybrid modes) and in quantizing magnetic field where edge magnetoplasmons hybridize with substrate phonons. The hybrid modes are predicted to occur in THz and far-IR ranges for several combinations of quasi-2D materials (single- and bilayer graphene, quantum wells, thin-film semiconductors) and substrates with polar-phonon resonances.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged boron vacancy center in 2D hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising quantum sensor. However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions. These findings and the developed methodology offer valuable insights for mitigating decoherence in a low-field regime.</p>

            <p>Topological phases of matter can appear in noninteracting systems, as in band topology, or interacting systems, such as in spin models, with their defining features typically robust against weak disorder. Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>The non-Abelian exchange statistics of Majorana zero modes make them interesting for both technological applications and fundamental research. Unlike their non-Abelian counterpart, the Abelian contribution $e^{i \theta}$, where $\theta$ is directly related to the Majorana's topological spin, is often neglected. However, the Abelian exchange phase and hence the topological spin can differ from system to system. For vortices in topological superconductors, the Abelian exchange phase is interpreted as an Aharonov-Casher phase arising from a vortex encircling an $e/4$ charge. In this work, we show how this fractional charge and hence the topological spin can be manipulated, introducing an additional knob for braiding operations in topological quantum computing. To probe this effect, we propose a vortex interference experiment that reveals the effect of this fractional charge through measurable shifts in the critical current.</p>

Depending on the precise parameter regime, both antiferromagnetically ordered as well as quantum-disordered states are found, with a particularly prominent example being a quantum spin liquid-type ground state on top of charge-ordering with effective Kagomé geometry. We discuss the different mechanisms at play in stabilizing various electronic and magnetic states.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonie Woodland, Ryutaro Okuma, J. Ross Stewart, Christian Balz, Radu Coldea</p>
            <p>We report high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the excitation spectrum in large single crystals of the spin-1/2 triangular lattice Ising-like antiferromagnet Na2BaCo(PO4)2 in magnetic fields applied transverse to the Ising axis. In the high-field polarized phase above a critical field $B_{C}$ we observe sharp magnons, as expected in the case of no exchange disorder. Through simultaneous fits to the dispersions including data in polarizing field along the Ising axis, we obtain an excellent match to an Ising-like XXZ Hamiltonian and rule out previously proposed Kitaev exchanges. In the intermediate-field phase below $B_{C}$, we observe three dispersive modes, out of which only the lowest energy one is sharp and the others are broad and overlap with continuum scattering. We propose that the broadening effects are due to magnon decays into two-magnon excitations and confirm that such processes are kinematically allowed. The continuum scattering becomes progressively stronger upon lowering field and, at 0.25 T and zero field, it dominates the complete spectrum with no clear evidence for even broadened magnon modes. We discuss the relevance of the continuous manifold of mean-field degenerate ground states of the refined Hamiltonian for capturing the observed spectrum in zero field, and compare the data with the one- and two-magnon spectrum averaged over this manifold. We also propose a model of the interlayer couplings to explain the observed finite interlayer magnetic propagation vector of the zero-field magnetic order; this requires the breaking of the mirror symmetry in the nominal P-3m1 space group and through refinement of x-ray diffraction data on an untwinned single crystal, we indeed confirm a rotation of the CoO6 octahedra around the c-axis, which lowers the symmetry to P-3.</p>

Rashba-type SOC plays a crucial role in determining the spin polarization direction and enhancing the generation efficiency of pure spin Hall currents.

            <h2>Interface-Bound States and Majorana Zero Modes in Lateral Heterostructures of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with Proximity-Induced Superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoonkang Kim</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive investigation into the emergence of interface-bound states, particularly Majorana zero modes (MZMs), in a lateral heterostructure composed of two three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, under the influence of proximity-induced superconductivity from niobium (Nb) contacts. We develop an advanced two-dimensional Dirac model for the topological surface states (TSS), incorporating spatially varying chemical potentials and s-wave superconducting pairing. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism, we derive analytical solutions for the bound states and compute the local density of states (LDOS) at the interface, revealing zero-energy modes characteristic of MZMs. The topological nature of these states is rigorously analyzed through winding numbers and Pfaffian invariants, and their robustness is explored under various physical perturbations, including gating effects. Our findings highlight the potential of this heterostructure as a platform for topological quantum computing, with detailed predictions for experimental signatures via tunneling spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>Superradiance Enhanced Light-Matter Interaction in Spatially Ordered Shape and Volume Controlled Single Quantum Dots: Enabling On-Chip Photonic Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Jordao, Qi Huang, Swarnabha Chattaraj, Siyuan Lu, Jiefei Zhang, Anupam Madhukar</p>
            <p>On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, characteristic of a delicate balance between the confinement potential volume, depth, and the resulting binding energy of the center of mass motion of the exciton and the exciton binding energy. In the exciton's weak confinement regime, direct enhancement of the quantum dot oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated for emitters in large arrays. Our findings provide compelling incentive for investigations of the potential of SESRE based tailored MTSQDs of lattice matched and mismatched material combinations for fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by these unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units.</p>

            <p>Introduced by David Thouless in 1983, Thouless pumping exemplifies topological properties in topological systems, where the transported charge is quantized by the Chern number. Recently, returning Thouless pumping was theoretically proposed, in which quantized charge is pumped during the first half of the cycle but returns to zero in the second half. This mechanism leads to crystalline symmetry-protected delicate topological insulators. Unlike conventional topological bands, a delicate topological band is Wannierizable but not atomically obstructed, which features multicellular Wannier functions extending beyond a single unit cell. Here, by replacing the second dimension with a synthetic dimension, we realize a two-dimensional delicate topological insulator via a set of one-dimensional acoustic crystals with fine-tuned geometric parameters. Through acoustic bands and wavefunction measurements, we directly observe returning Thouless pumping and symmetric multicellular Wannier functions, followed by establishing the bulk-boundary correspondence between sub-Brillouin zone Chern numbers and gapless boundary modes. As enriched by crystalline symmetries, our experimental demonstration of returning Thouless pumping expands the current understanding of topological phases of matter.</p>

            <p>A critical issue affecting filamentary resistive random access memory (RRAM) cells is the requirement of high voltages during electroforming. Reducing the magnitude of these voltages is of significant interest, as it ensures compatibility with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Previous studies have identified that changing the initial stoichiometry of the switching layer and/or implementing thermal engineering approaches has an influence over the electroforming voltage magnitude, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we develop an understanding of how these mechanisms work within a standard a-HfO$_x$/Ti RRAM stack through combining atomistic driven-Kinetic Monte Carlo (d-KMC) simulations with experimental data. By performing device-scale simulations at atomistic resolution, we can precisely model the movements of point defects under applied biases in structurally inhomogeneous materials, which allows us to not only capture finite-size effects but also to understand how conductive filaments grow under different electroforming conditions. Doing atomistic simulations at the device-level also enables us to link simulations of the mechanisms behind conductive filament formation with trends in experimental data with the same material stack. We identify a transition from primarily vertical to lateral ion movement dominating the filamentary growth process in sub-stoichiometric oxides, and differentiate the influence of global and local heating on the morphology of the formed filaments. These different filamentary structures have implications for the dynamic range exhibited by formed devices in subsequent SET/RESET operations. Overall, our results unify the complex ion dynamics in technologically relevant HfO$_x$/Ti-based stacks, and provide guidelines that can be leveraged when fabricating devices.</p>

            <p>Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) response in magnetic systems is typically proportional to an out-of-plane magnetization component because of the restriction imposed by system symmetries, which demands that the magnetization, applied electric field, and induced Hall current are mutually orthogonal to each other. Here, we report experimental realization of an unconventional form of AHE in a low-dimensional heterostructure, wherein the Hall response is not only proportional to the out-of-plane magnetization component but also to the in-plane magnetization component. By interfacing a low-symmetry topological semimetal (TaIrTe4) with the ferromagnetic insulator (Cr2Ge2Te6), we create a low-dimensional magnetic system, where only one mirror symmetry is preserved. We show that as long as the magnetization has a finite component in the mirror plane, this last mirror symmetry is broken, allowing the emergence of an AHE signal proportional to in-plane magnetization. Our experiments, conducted on multiple devices, reveal a gate-voltage-dependent AHE response, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms responsible for the Hall effect in our system can be tuned via electrostatic gating. A minimal microscopic model constrained by the symmetry of the heterostructure shows that both interfacial spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry breaking via the exchange interaction from magnetization are responsible for the emergence of the in-plane AHE. Our work highlights the importance of system symmetries and exchange interaction in low-dimensional heterostructures for designing novel and tunable Hall effects in layered quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets has opened new avenues for exploring topological spin textures and their applications in next-generation spintronics. Among these materials, Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT) emerges as a model system due to its room-temperature skyrmion phases, which are stabilized by strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, the atomistic origins of DMI in centrosymmetric vdW lattices remain elusive. Here, we report a spontaneous DMI enhancement mechanism driven by FC in FGaT and its analog Fe3GeTe2 (FGeT). Combining Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we have observed the irreversible precipitation of FeTe2 in annealed FGaT. The resulting FeTe2/FGaT heterostructure is considered to break the symmetry and significantly enhance the DMI. Furthermore, similar phenomenon has been observed in the family ferromagnetic material FGeT as well. Additionally, the precipitation of FeTe2 varies significantly with different thicknesses of FGaT, aligning closely with the reported behavior of skyrmions. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms behind the origin of the DMI in ternary tellurides, paving the way for advanced spintronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruihuan Cheng, Chen Wang, Niuchang Ouyang, Xingchen Shen, Yue Chen</p>
            <p>Crystalline solids with extreme insulation often exhibit a plateau or even an upward-sloping tail in thermal conductivity above room temperature. Herein, we synthesized a crystalline material AgTl$_2$I$_3$ with an exceptionally low thermal conductivity of 0.21 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, which continues to decrease to 0.17 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 523 K. We adopted an integrated experimental and theoretical approach to reveal the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of AgTl$_2$I$_3$. Our results suggest that the Ag-I polyhedron enables extended antibonding states to weaken the chemical bonding, fostering strong lattice anharmonicity driven by the rattling vibrations of Ag atoms and causing lattice softening. Experimental measurements further corroborate the large atomic thermal motions and low sound velocity. These features impede particle-like phonon propagation, and significantly diminish the contribution of wave-like phonon tunneling. This work highlights a strategy for designing thermal insulating materials by leveraging crystal structure and chemical bonding, providing a pathway for advancing the development of thermal insulators.</p>

            <p>Monolayer MoS$_2$ has long served as a prototypical material exhibiting valleytronic behavior, yet it remains unclear exactly how phonons induce a valley depolarization of its excitonic states. Here, we apply a mixed quantum--classical simulation framework to study the phonon-induced mechanisms affecting valley polarization at short times. Our framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure as well as the electron-hole and carrier-phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations, while retaining explicit information on transient phonon occupancies. By means of such occupancies, our simulations show a resonance between the lowest exciton band and the dominant optical phonon branch to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle-Silva-Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.</p>

            <p>Novel physical properties have been reported recently by stacking graphene-like systems in different configurations. Here, we explore the nature of emergent localized states at the edges of twisted bilayer graphene nanoribbons. Based on an extended tight-binding Hamiltonian, which includes hopping energy within a wide atomic neighborhood, we investigate the nature of the electronic states responsible for the transport along the four graphene nanoribbon terminals. The emphasis is on discussing the role of the stacking region symmetries, the twisted angle between the crossed zigzag nanoribbons, and also the width of the ribbons in the electronic and transport responses of the four terminals. Our findings show a direct connection between the number of non-equivalent sites on the edge of the stacking region and the localized states, in accordance with reported scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. Within the parameters explored, the twist angle was revealed to be the most powerful tool to control transport responses in the investigated 4-terminal devices, including special electronic beam splitter phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junghwan Kim, Hanan Dery, Dinh Van Tuan</p>
            <p>Long-range Coulomb forces give rise to correlated insulating states when charge particles populate a moiré superlattice at certain fractional filling factors. Such behavior is characterized by a broken translation symmetry wherein particles spontaneously form a Wigner crystal. Focusing on the experimental findings of Xu et al. [Nature \textbf{587}, 214 (2020)], we present a theory that captures the correlated insulating state of a fractionally-filled moiré superlattice through the energy shift and change in oscillator strength of the exciton absorption resonance. The theory shows that the experimental findings can only be supported if the electrons reside in a charge-ordered state (i.e., electrons are not randomly distributed among the sites of the moiré superlattice). Furthermore, we explain why the energy shifts of exciton resonances are qualitatively different in cases that the superlattice is nearly empty compared with a superlattice whose sites are doubly occupied.</p>

This resonance appears slightly below the 2s exciton in energy. Strikingly, the 2s trion is found to be bound only for magnetic fields larger than 1 T. The signature of the 2s trion is absent in the magneto-reflectance spectra, while it is detectable in the MOKE spectra signifying the importance of the powerful technique. Similar to the 1s states, the 2s trion shows an opposite degree of magnetic-field-induced polarization compared to its exciton counterpart, in agreement with our theoretical calculations. This transfer of oscillator strength between the complexes establishes an optical fingerprint of the 2s excited trion.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Wang, X. Z. Zhang</p>
            <p>The bosonic statistics, which allow for macroscopic multi-occupancy of single-particle states, pose significant challenges for analyzing quantum phase transitions in interacting bosonic systems, both analytically and numerically. In this work, we systematically investigate the non-Hermitian Bloch core matrix of a Hermitian staggered bosonic Kitaev chain, formulated within the Nambu framework. We derive explicit analytic conditions for the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the $4\times 4$ Bloch core matrix, with each EP marking the onset of complex-conjugate eigenvalue pairs. By mapping the full many-body Hamiltonian onto an effective tight-binding network in Fock-space and introducing layer-resolved inverse participation ratio, we demonstrate that these EPs coincide precisely with sharp localization--delocalization transitions of collective eigenstates. Comprehensive numerical analyses across hopping amplitudes, pairing strengths, and on-site potentials confirm that the EP of effective Hamiltonian universally capture the global many-body phase boundaries. Our results establish an analytically tractable, EP-based criterion for detecting critical behavior in interacting bosonic lattices, with direct relevance to photonic and cold-atom experimental platforms.</p>

            <p>Relaxation processes following light excitation in semiconductors are key in materials-based quantum technology applications. These processes are broadly studied in atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), quasi-two-dimensional excitonic semiconductors in which atomistic design allows for tunable excited-state properties, such as relaxation lifetimes and photo-induced coherence. In this work, we present a density-matrix-based approach to compute exciton relaxation within a many-body ab initio perspective. We expand our previously developed Lindblad density-matrix formalism to capture multi-channel electron-hole pair relaxation processes, including phonon and Coulomb scattering as well as radiative recombination, and study their effect on the time-resolved excited-state propagation. Using monolayer MoSe$_2$ as a prototypical example, we examine many-body effects on the time-dependent dynamics of photoactive excitations, exploring how the electron-hole pair interactions are reflected in variations of the excitation energy, spectral signature, and state coherence. Our method supplies a detailed understanding of exciton relaxation mechanisms in realistic materials, offering a previously unexplored pathway to study excited-state dynamics in semiconductors from first principles.</p>

            <p>We present a large-scale simulation of the three-dimensional and mean-field spin glasses down to a very low but finite temperature. We extrapolate pertinent observables, e.g., the disorder-averaged central weight to zero temperature, finding that many thermodynamic states at a finite temperature and two ground states at zero temperature are fully compatible. While the disorder-averaged central weight monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature, this is far from true for individual samples. This motivates us to link this behaviour with the well-known temperature chaos. At an observing temperature, a sample may or may not have pure state coexistence depending on whether it is undergoing temperature chaos, which is a random process. Therefore, temperature chaos is likely responsible for the emergence of many pure states, providing a natural and intuitive explanation for the coexistence of expensive domain-wall excitations and many pure states at the disorder-averaged level.</p>

Specifically, we demonstrate that the electronic specific heat exhibits a distinctive signature across the transition, directly reflecting the anomalous evolution of the density of states with disorder strength. Our findings, supported by numerical analysis, establish specific heat measurement as a powerful and sensitive probe for detecting the critical point.

            <p>We develop a Fermi liquid theory of $d$-wave altermagnets and apply it to describe their collective excitation spectrum. We predict that in addition to a conventional undamped plasmon mode, where both spin components oscillate in phase, there is an acoustic plasmon (or {\em demon}) mode with out-of-phase spin dynamics. By analyzing the dynamical structure factor, we reveal a strong dependence of the demon's frequency and spectral weight both on the Landau parameters and on the direction of propagation. Notably, as a function of the propagation angle, we show that the acoustic mode evolves from a {\em hidden state}, which has zero spectral weight in the density excitation spectrum, to a weakly damped propagating demon mode and then to a {\em Fano-demon mixed state}, which is marked by a strong hybridization with particle-hole excitations and a corresponding asymmetric line shape in the structure factor. Our study paves the way for applications of altermagnetic materials in opto-spintronics by harnessing itinerant electron spin oscillations beyond traditional magnon spin waves.</p>

            <p>Gas hydrates are considered fundamental building blocks of giant icy planets like Neptune and similar exoplanets. The existence of these materials in the interiors of giant icy planets, which are subject to high pressures and temperatures, depends on their stability relative to their constituent components. In this study, we reexamine the structural stability and hydrogen content of hydrogen hydrates, (H2O)(H2)n, up to 104 GPa, focusing on hydrogen-rich materials. Using synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles theoretical calculations, we find that the C2-filled ice phase undergoes a transformation to C3-filled ice phase over a broad pressure range of 47 - 104 GPa at room temperature. The C3 phase contains twice as much molecular H2 as the C2 phase. Heating the C2-filled ice above approximately 1500 K induces the transition to the C3 phase at pressures as low as 47 GPa. Upon decompression, this phase remains metastable down to 40 GPa. These findings establish new stability limits for hydrates, with implications for hydrogen storage and the interiors of planetary bodies.</p>

Moreover, the signs of the imaginary part of the dielectric permeability, the refractive index, and the frequency show the instability of the parallel spin configuration at the propagation of the linearly polarized electromagnetic wave due to the effective magnetoelectric interaction.</p>

            <p>We evaluate the loss of stability of axially compressed slender and thick-walled tubes subject to a residual stress distribution. The nonlinear theory of elasticity, when used to analyze the underlying deformation, shows that the residual stress induces preferred directions in the reference configuration. The incremental theory, given in Stroh form, is used to derive an exact bifurcation condition. The critical stretch and the associated critical buckling mode are identified for axisymmetric and asymmetric increments in the deformation. Mode transitions are illustrated as the tube slenderness varies. For slender tubes, Euler buckling is energetically favorable, and the effect of residual stress is negligible. However, for short and thick-walled tubes where barreling mode is dominant, the residual stress significantly affects the buckling behavior and may eliminate barreling instability. We show that, depending on its magnitude and direction, residual stress can either accelerate or delay instability. Phase diagrams for various modes are obtained and provide insight into pattern selection across different tube geometries.</p>

To control and tune the local magnetic field in magnetic material we propose to exploit superconducting nanorings. The field stabilizes the skyrmion through the presence of persistent current induced by the pulses of external field. We analyze the conditions for the stabilization of Neel skyrmion in ferromagnetic layers with out-of-plane anisotropy, as a function of the nanoring size and induced superconducting current. We show that the superconducting current should exceed a critical value for the skyrmion to become stable.

            <p>Photovoltaic Hall effect is an interesting platform of Berry curvature engineering by external fields. Floquet engineering aims at generation of light-induced Berry curvature associated with topological phase transition in solids, which may manifest itself as a light-induced anomalous Hall effect. However, recent studies have pointed out an important role of the bias electric field, which adds a field-induced circular photogalvanic effect to the photovoltaic Hall effect. Except for numerical studies, the two mechanisms have been described by different theoretical frameworks, hindering a coherent understanding. Here, we develop a unified theory of the photovoltaic Hall effect capable of describing both mechanisms on an equal footing. We reveal that the bias electric field alters the interband transition dipole moment, transition energy, and intraband velocity, all contributing to the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect in nonmagnetic materials. The first process can be expressed as a manifestation of the electric field-induced Berry curvature. Shift vector plays an essential role in determining the transition energy shift. We also clearly distinguish the anomalous Hall effect by light-dressed states within the density matrix calculation using the length gauge. Our theory unifies a number of nonlinear optical processes in a physically transparent way and reveals their geometric aspect.</p>

            <p>We report the details of the growth of ultra-clean single crystals for RuO2, a candidate material for altermagnetism. By using a crystal-growth tube with a necking structure and precisely controlling the conditions of the sublimation transport method, it is possible to control the morphology of the crystals. We obtained crystals in mainly three kinds of morphology: thick plate-like crystals typically 5 x 3 x 2mm3 and up to 10 x 5 x 2mm3 with a large (101) facet, rhombohedral columnar crystals elongating along the [001] direction, and fiber and needle crystals of length up to 8 mm and the width of 0.1-0.4 mm. These crystals show residual resistivity of about 30 nOhmcm and a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) up to 1200. The crystals do not exhibit any signs of magnetic ordering down to low temperatures.</p>

            <p>Magnetic excitations are important quantum phenomena in magnetic systems and have been widely studied in individual magnetic atoms and molecules as well as their assembled structures over the past few decades. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) combined with density functional theory (DFT) and the state-of-the-art ab initio wavefunction calculations, we investigated the properties of a novel dual-core Cr2Br6 molecule, which consists of two Cr ions coupled via superexchange through a single near-90° Cr-Br-Cr scissors bond. Under zero magnetic field, we observed a Fano peak with multi-steps through STS. When an external magnetic field is applied, some steps exhibit additional splitting, while others change little. We find that the Cr2Br6, exhibits a spin-degenerate ground state, and the complex peak splitting arises from the coexistence of vibrational and magnetic excitations in the molecule. Our results reveal rich quantum spin behavior in a well-defined two-core magnetic trihalide complex at the atomic scale, offering not only a minimal model for superexchange-coupled multi-spin quantum excitations but also a possible foundational unit for future molecule-based quantum functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Generation of magnetic chiral solitons, skyrmions, and hedgehogs with electric fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruya Nakagawara, Minoru Kanega, Shunsuke C. Furuya, Masahiro Sato</p>
            <p>Electric-field controls of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) have recently been discussed from the microscopic viewpoint. Since the DMI plays a critical role in generating topological spin textures (TSTs) such as the chiral soliton, the magnetic skyrmion, and the magnetic hedgehog, electric-field controls of these TSTs have become an important issue. This paper shows that such electric-field-induced DMI indeed creates and annihilates TSTs by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for many-body spin systems at finite temperatures. We show that when a strong electric field is applied in a proper way to one- or two-dimensional ferromagnets, the Hamiltonians are changed into the well-known spin models for the chiral soliton or the skyrmion lattice, and the TST states emerge. We utilize a machine-learning method to count the number of generated TSTs. In the three-dimensional (3D) case, we demonstrate the electric-field induction of a magnetic hedgehog structure as follows: Applying a strong enough electric field along a proper direction to a skyrmion-string state (a triple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state) at low but finite temperatures, we find that the field-induced DMI can drive a quadruple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state with hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs. This result indicates that we have succeeded in constructing a simple 3D short-range interacting spin model hosting a magnetic hedgehog structure.</p>

            <h2>Pseudo-Goldstone Modes at Finite Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiyue Lin, Tao Shi</p>
            <p>Goldstone's theorem and its extension to pseudo-Goldstone (PG) modes have profound implications across diverse areas of physics, from quantum chromodynamics to quantum magnetism. PG modes emerge from accidental degeneracies lifted by quantum and thermal fluctuations, leading to a finite gap--a phenomenon known as "order by disorder." In this paper, we derive a general curvature formula for the PG gap at finite temperature, applicable to both collinear (e.g., ferromagnets and anti-ferromagnets) and noncollinear magnetic orders (e.g., coplanar orders in frustrated magnetic systems). After validating our formula against known models, we apply it to the XXZ model on the triangular lattice, which hosts coplanar magnetic orders in equilibrium and is relevant to materials such as Na2BaCo(PO4)2 and K2Co(SeO3)2, known for their supersolid phases and giant magnetocaloric effects. Our results reveal a distinct scaling behavior: a linear decrease of the PG gap with temperature, driven by entropy effects from magnon scattering across multiple bands. This stands in stark contrast to the high-temperature scaling recently proposed for systems with a single magnon band. This work establishes a general framework for investigating PG modes at finite temperatures and opens an avenue to explore rich quantum phases and dynamics in frustrated systems with noncollinear magnetic orders.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takuto Soma, Kohei Yoshimatsu, Akira Ohtomo</p>
            <p>The emergence of superconductivity with strong correlation is one of the most attracted issues in condensed-matter physics, as seen in various unconventional superconductors. Here we show a new strongly correlated superconductor Li1-xNbO2 with rich characteristics such as two-dimensional, geometrically frustrated, and triangular NbO2 lattice and correlated flat-band-like electronic states. We revealed the electronic phase diagram by implementing Li-ion electrochemical cells with LiNbO2 epitaxial films. The Li-ion deintercalation increased the hole-doping level in NbO2 layer, along which a band insulator LiNbO2 underwent to a Fermi-liquid (FL) metal and superconductor associated with non-Fermi liquid (NFL) characters. The evolution of the NFL state coincided with the suppression of the Kondo-singlet formation near the superconducting dome, which linked superconductivity with quantum criticality. The obtained phase diagram involves general aspects of strongly correlated superconductors and bridges the gap between various systems.</p>

            <h2>Topological surface states induced by magnetic proximity effect in narrow-gap semiconductor alpha-Sn</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soichiro Fukuoka, Le Duc Anh, Masayuki Ishida, Tomoki Hotta, Takahiro Chiba, Yohei Kota, Masaaki Tanaka</p>
            <p>The combination of magnetism and topological properties in one material platform is attracting significant attention due to the potential of realizing low power consumption and error-robust electronic devices. Common practice is to start from a topological material with band inversion and incorporates ferromagnetism via chemical doping or magnetic proximity effect (MPE). In this work, we show that a topological material is not necessary and that both ferromagnetism and band inversion can be established simultaneously in a trivial insulating material by MPE from a neighbouring ferromagnetic layer. This novel route is demonstrated using quantum transport measurements and first principles calculations in a heterostructure consisting of 5 nm thick FeOx/1 monolayer of FeAs/ 3 nm thick alpha Sn. The Shubnikov de Haas oscillations show that there is linear band dispersion with high mobility in the heterostructure even though a 3 nm thick alpha Sn single layer is a trivial semiconductor. Furthermore, first principles calculations reveal that band inversion indeed occurs in this heterostructure, suggesting that the observed linear band is a topological surface state within this inverted gap. This work significantly expands the foundation for realizing magnetic topological materials in a myriad of trivial narrow gap semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Interplay between timescales governs the residual activity of a harmonically bound active Brownian particle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanatan Halder, Manas Khan</p>
            <p>Active microparticles in confining potentials manifest complex and intriguing dynamical phenomena, as their activity competes with confinement. The steady-state position distributions of harmonically bound active Brownian particles (HBABPs) exhibit a crossover from Boltzmann-like to bimodal, commonly recognized as passive to active transition, upon variation of the activity and the confinement strength. By studying optically trapped phoretically active Janus colloids, along with simulations and analytical calculations of HBABPs, we provide a comprehensive dynamical description emphasizing the resultant velocity to examine this understanding. Our results establish that the crossover is instead from active to passive-like, and is governed solely by the interplay between the persistence time $\tau_{\rm R}$, and the equilibration time in harmonic potential $\tau_k$. When $\tau_{\rm R} < \tau_k$, despite a Boltzmann-like position distribution, the HBABP retains a substantial resultant or residual active velocity, denoting an activity-dominated regime. In contrast, at $\tau_{\rm R} > \tau_k$, the restoring force fully counterbalances propulsion at a radial distance, where the HBABP exhibits harmonically bound Brownian particle (HBBP)-like dynamics, and the position distribution becomes bimodal. We further provide a quantitative measure of the residual activity, which decreases monotonically with $\tau_{\rm R} / \tau_k$, eventually converging to a nominal value corresponding to HBBP as $\tau_{\rm R} / \tau_k$ exceeds 1, corroborating our conclusions.</p>

            <h2>Crossed pseudopotential$-$functional calculations made simple: An extended Kohn-Sham framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuiyu Ye, Jiale Shen, Haitao Liu, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Modern density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations rely heavily on pseudopotentials, yet their impact on accuracy is barely addressed. In this work, we derive from the Kohn-Sham equation that the use of pseudopotentials invariably introduces a ``dropping" error, which leads to a deviation from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Crossed pseudopotential-functional calculations provide a pragmatic way to balance accuracy and efficiency, enabling the right results for the right reasons. This paradigm goes beyond the (generalized) Kohn-Sham framework, which we name the extended Kohn-Sham framework. We support our assertion with a bandgap study on 54 monovalent-Cu semiconductors. The crossed calculations, compared to consistent ones, not only remove all 11 erroneous metal predictions, but also drastically reduce the mean relative error from 80\% to 20\%. The accuracy even exceeds that of the hybrid functionals and GW due to the role of pseudopotentials in modelling the external potentials of Cu-valence electrons that cannot be compensated by exchange-correlation.</p>

            <h2>Current-induced Nonequilibrium Phase Transition Accompanied by Giant Gap Reduction in Vanadium Dioxide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akitoshi Nakano, Masato Imaizumi, Ichiro Terasaki</p>
            <p>We investigated nonlinear conduction in bulk single crystals of VO2 with precise temperature control. Two distinct nonequilibrium phenomena were identified: a gradual reduction of the charge gap and a current-induced insulator-metal transition. The electric field required to drive the nonlinear conduction is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than that reported for VO2 thin films or nanobeams, strongly indicating an intrinsic electronic origin rather than a temperature increase due to self heating. Notably, our results suggest that the application of a steady current to the frozen insulating state can induce a nonequilibrium steady-state metallic phase -- effectively melting the electronic ice. This highlights a novel route to controlling electronic states via nonthermal, current-driven mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Zirconium nitride (ZrN) is a refractory material with good mechanical and thermal properties. It is therefore a good candidate for hard surface treatment at high temperature. In this work, we report the growth and characterization of ZrN by plasma assisted thermal nitridation of zirconium films in a NH3 atmosphere. The process was monitored by in situ monochromatic ellipsometry and the nitrides grown were profiled and analyzed by Auger electron spectroscopy. By using temperatures in the 700--800___{\textdegree}C range, the material obtained is quite close to ZrN, but, depending on experimental conditions, residual oxygen (impurities) can be easily incorporated by reaction with zirconium. The analysis of the ellipsometric data has shown that the nitridation did not occur by simple growth of nitride on zirconium. Auger profiles confirmed the presence of an oxidized zirconium layer localized between the nitrided surface and the remaining metal. This oxidation was observed to occur preferentially during temperature ramping, that is, in the low temperature regime. At high temperature, nitridation is dominant and the incorporated oxygen is exchanged with nitrogen. Oxygen is then partly rejected by diffusion out of the film through the ZrN surface layer and partly by diffusion in the deep zirconium sublayer. By using these observations, a new model of growth with a layered ZrN/ZrOx/Zr film was used to describe in situ ellipsometric data. By comparing the pure thermal and the plasma treatments, the advantages of the plasma assisted treatment become clearly: complete nitridation of the zirconium layer was achieved and the oxygen amounts in the film were substantially reduced.</p>

            <p>We address that the stray magnetic field emitted by the excited quantum states of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers is spin-momentum locked, such that the spin transfer to nearby ferromagnetic nanostructures is unidirectional. This may allow the controlled excitation of propagating magnons by NV centers in diamond. A pair of NV spin qubits exchange virtual magnons in a magnetic nanowire in a chiral manner that leads to directional quantum entanglement. A magnon-based ``quantum-entanglement isolator" should be a useful device in future quantum information technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Makoto Naka, Yukitoshi Motome, Tsuyoshi Miyazaki, Hitoshi Seo</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the piezomagnetic effect on the altermagnetic state in $\kappa$-type molecular conductors, focusing on its nonrelativistic mechanism. By introducing shear stress as a monoclinic distortion, we evaluate variations in the effective tight-binding model using first-principles calculations. Using the derived parameters, we investigate the Hubbard model and its effective Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional (distorted) $\kappa$-type lattice within mean-field approximation. We show that the system exhibits the piezomagnetic effect, i.e., a net magnetization induced at finite temperatures in the undoped insulating state and both in the ground state and at finite temperatures upon doping. In a real-space picture, this uniform magnetization arises from the ferrimagnetic spin structure due to inequivalent spin sites induced by lattice distortion. Meanwhile, in a momentum-space picture, it stems from the {\it s}-wave spin splitting of the electron and magnon bands, independent of spin-orbit coupling. We find that this nonrelativistic piezomagnetism remains finite, but becomes smaller in the limit of strong dimerization where the energy gap between the bonding and antibonding orbitals is infinitely large and the {\it d}-wave altermagnetic spin splitting is absent, highlighting the importance of the multi-orbital nature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Baptiste Fouvry, Pierre-Henri Chavanis</p>
            <p>We investigate the long-term relaxation of a distribution of $N$ point vortices in two-dimensional hydrodynamics, in the limit of weak collective amplification. Placing ourselves within the limit of an average axisymmetric distribution, we stress the connections with generic long-range interacting systems, whose relaxation is described within angle-action coordinates. In particular, we emphasise the existence of two regimes of relaxation, depending on whether the system's profile of mean angular velocity (frequency) is a non-monotonic [resp. monotonic] function of radius, which we refer to as profile (1) [resp. profile (2)]. For profile (1), relaxation occurs through two-body non-local resonant couplings, i.e. $1/N$ effects, as described by the inhomogeneous Landau equation. For profile (2), the impossibility of such two-body resonances submits the system to a ``kinetic blocking''. Relaxation is then driven by three-body couplings, i.e. $1/N^{2}$ effects, whose associated kinetic equation has only recently been derived. For both regimes, we compare extensively the kinetic predictions with large ensemble of direct $N$-body simulations. In particular, for profile (1), we explore numerically an effect akin to ``resonance broadening'' close to the extremum of the angular velocity profile. Quantitative description of such subtle nonlinear effects will be the topic of future investigations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the pairing symmetry in the novel superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure by the non-perturbative variational quantum Monte Carlo. Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p>

            <p>Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has revolutionized high-volume manufacturing of nanoscale components, enabling the production of smaller, denser, and more energy efficient integrated circuit devices. Yet, the use of EUV light results in ionization driven chemistry within the imaging materials of lithography, the photoresists. The complex interplay of ionization, generation of primary and secondary electrons, and the subsequent chemical mechanisms leading to image formation in photoresists has been notoriously difficult to study. In this work, we deploy photoemission spectroscopy with a 92 eV EUV light source combined with first-principles simulations to unravel the chemical changes occurring during exposure in a model chemically amplified photoresist. The results reveal a surprising chemical reaction pathway, namely the EUV-induced breakdown of the photoacid generator (PAG), which is a critical component in the EUV mechanism. This previously unobserved reaction mechanism manifests as changes in intensity of the valence band peaks of the EUV photoemission spectrum, which are linked to degradation of the PAG via an advanced atomistic simulation framework. Our combined experimental and theoretical approach shows that EUV photoemission can simultaneously resolve chemical dynamics and the production of primary and secondary electrons, giving unique insights into the chemical transformation of photoresist materials. Our results pave the way for utilizing accessible, table-top EUV spectroscopy systems for observing EUV photoresist chemical dynamics, with the potential for time-resolved measurements of photoemission processes in the future.</p>

            <p>The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a photoluminescent defect in diamond that exists in different charge states, NV$^-$ and NV$^0$, that are sensitive to the NV's nanoscale environment. Here, we show that photoluminescence (PL) from NV centers in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) can be employed for all-optical voltage sensing based on electric field-induced NV charge state modulation. More than 95% of FNDs integrated into a capacitor device show a transient increase in NV$^-$ PL intensity of up to 31% within 0.1 ms after application of an external voltage, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in NV$^0$ PL. The change in NV$^-$ PL increases with increasing applied voltage from 0 to 100 V, corresponding to an electric field of 0 to 625 kV cm$^ {-1}$ in our devices. The electric field sensitivity of a single FND is 19 V cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^ {-1/2}$. We investigate the NV charge state photodynamics on the millisecond timescale and find that the change in NV PL strongly depends on the rate of photoexcitation. We propose a model that qualitatively explains the observed changes in NV PL based on an electric field-induced redistribution of photoexcited electrons from substitutional nitrogen defects to NV centers, leading to a transient conversion of NV$^0$ to NV$^-$ centers upon application of an external voltage. Our results contribute to the development of FNDs as reliable, all-optical, nanoscale electric field sensors in solid-state systems.</p>

            <p>Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals heterostructures have become a rapidly growing field in condensed matter research, offering a platform to engineer novel quantum systems by stacking different two-dimensional (2D) materials. A diverse range of material combinations, including hexagonal boron nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene, with electronic properties spanning from insulating to semiconducting, metallic, and semimetallic, have been explored to tune the properties of these heterostacks. However, understanding the interactions and charge transfer between the stacked layers remains challenging, particularly when more than two layers are involved. In this study, we investigate the charge transfer in a potassium-adlayer/graphene/lead-monolayer heterostructure stacked on a SiC substrate. Using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we analyze the band structure of each layer, focusing on the charge transfer from K to the underlying 2D layers. Since K forms a $(2 \times 2)$ overlayer with respect to graphene, the amount of charge carriers donated by K can be determined. Our findings reveal that adsorption of K not only leads to a significant $n$-doping of the adjacent graphene layer but also to an electron transfer into the Pb monolayer. Remarkably, $\approx 44\%$ of the electrons donated by the K adlayer are transferred into its second nearest neighbouring layer, i.e. Pb, while $\approx 56\%$ remain in the graphene.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity under pressure in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has attracted a great deal of attention. Here, using density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we study the correlated electronic structure of the latest superconducting member of the family: the alternating single-layer bilayer nickelate La$_{5}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{11}$. Due to its alternating single-layer and bilayer structural motif, this hybrid RP nickelate exhibits layer-selective physics with the single-layer neighboring a Mott instability, rendering the bilayer the dominant contributor to its low-energy physics, both at ambient and high pressure. The electronic structure of La$_{5}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{11}$ ultimately resembles that of the bilayer compound La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$, pointing to the presence of universal features in the family of superconducting RP nickelates. Thus, La$_{5}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{11}$ provides a new platform to disentangle the key degrees of freedom underlying superconductivity in pressurized RP nickelates, underscoring the central role of the bilayer structural motif.</p>

We address one aspect of this problem by studying the propagation of acoustic spin waves in a narrow physical conduit made of a synthetic antiferromagnet. Through a combination of Brillouin Light Scattering microscopy and modeling, we demonstrate that even when attempting to guide waves in the reciprocal direction of the material, the system still exhibits strong signatures of non-reciprocity. This includes the excitation of high wavevector waves in the direction perpendicular to the intended channeling, as well as energy transfer in directions that often neither aligns with the physical conduit nor with the symmetry axes of the magnetic properties. These findings have implications for the modeling of propagating wave spectroscopy in non-reciprocal materials and their potential applications.</p>

            <p>Short abstract: The paper reviews the physics of Frohlich excitonic polarons from the viewpoint of empirical approaches with some original developments. Models for excitonic polarons in ionic semiconductors in the spirit of the Lee Low and Pines (LLP) model for free polarons were initiated by Toyozawa and Hermanson and extended by Pollman and Buttner (PB). The dominant electron-hole interaction with the lattice introduced by Frohlich is represented by a long-range effective interaction with a single longitudinal optical polar mode. The properties of the excitonic polarons are characterized by various physical quantities such as effective dielectric constants, effective masses, virtual phonon populations, carrier self-energies and binding energies, and effective electron-hole interactions mediated by the lattice. In 3D perovskites, the excitonic polarons deviate from the simplified picture of weakly interacting (almost free) polarons, with sizeable effects of electron-hole correlations on all the physical properties.</p>

By leveraging an extensive dataset of experimental and computational results, the model effectively classifies electrode materials, predicts optimal doping ratios, and establishes robust structure-property relationships. Key findings include a 65.7\% increase in energy density for aluminum-doped PTFE and an 85.7\% improvement for fluorine-doped PTFE, highlighting the critical influence of doping materials and their concentrations. The model further identifies PTFE as a highly effective negative electrode material, achieving a maximum energy density of 1.12~J/cm$^2$ with 7\% silver (Ag) doping when copper (Cu) is used as the positive electrode. This data-driven approach not only accelerates material discovery but also significantly reduces experimental costs, providing novel insights into the fundamental factors influencing TENG performance. The proposed methodology establishes a robust platform for intelligent material design, advancing the development of sustainable energy technologies and self-powered systems.</p>

            <h2>Morphology and Strain Engineering of Cu-based Materials by Chemical Dealloying for Electrochemical CO Reduction</h2>

            <p>Nanoporous Cu (NPC), synthesized by chemical dealloying of brass, holds significant potential for catalysis of electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction, owing to the optimal binding energy of Cu with *CO and *H intermediates, and the abundance of surface under-coordinated atoms inherent to the nanoporous structure. However, further optimization of NPC morphology and chemistry for CO reduction can only be made possible by understanding the dealloying process. Hence overcoming challenges concerning the direct measurement of atomic scale chemistry and under-coordinated atoms in NPC nano-ligaments is vital. In this study, NPC with tunable ligament sizes between nanometer and micrometer range were synthesized by varying the temperature of Cu20Zn80 (atomic ratio) chemical dealloying in concentrated phosphoric acid. The evolution of chemistry and structure of nano-ligaments during dealloying were probed for the first time using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and cryo-atom probe tomography (APT) revealing the phase transformations and complex chemistry in nano-ligaments. A method based on the asymmetricity of synchrotron XRD peaks of NPC samples was also proposed to estimate the quantity of under-coordinated atoms on nano-ligaments, as ligament surface strain. Finally, CO reduction using electrochemistry mass spectrometry (EC-MS) demonstrated the promising performance of NPC compared to polycrystalline Cu. An optimal ligament surface strain value was also observed for the CO reduction on NPC, which provides more mechanistic insights into the complicated CO reduction process and an alternative strategy for Cu-based catalysts engineering. This work also shows how the application of synchrotron X-ray diffraction and EC-MS facilitates more efficient and accurate optimization of copper-based catalysts for electrochemical CO reduction.</p>

In addition to discussing heat to power conversion, cooling and heat transport, special emphasis is put on physical properties of hybrid devices that can be revealed by the thermoelectric effect.</p>

            <h2>Interaction Effects on the Electronic Floquet Spectra: Excitonic Effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teng Xiao, Tsan Huang, Changhua Bao, Zhiyuan Sun</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) and ultrafast optical experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Jue Zhang, Rong Lü, Qi-Bo Zeng</p>
            <p>We introduce a new type of one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing. We find three physical regimes in this model by tuning the $p$-wave pairing and the chemical potential of the system. In the topologically nontrivial phase, there are two Majorana zero modes localized at the opposite ends of the lattice, which are characterized and protected by nonzero topological invariants. More interestingly, we also find a regime where the system can hold four unprotected nonzero-energy edge modes in the trivial phase, which is analogous to a weak topological phase. The third regime is also trivial but holds no edge modes. The emergence of zero- and nonzero-energy edge modes in the system are analyzed by transforming the lattice model into a ladder consisting of Majorana fermions, where the competition between intra- and inter-leg couplings leads to the rich phase diagram. We further investigate the properties of edge modes under the influences of dissipation, which is represented by introducing a imaginary part in the chemical potential. Our work unveils the exotic properties induced by the staggered $p$-wave pairing and provides a new platform for further exploration of Majorana edge modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Mal, Subhankar Mishra, Prasenjit Sen</p>
            <p>Crystal structure generation is a foundational challenge in materials discovery, particularly in designing functional inorganic crystalline materials with desired properties. Most existing diffusion-based generative models for crystals rely on complex, hand-crafted priors and modular architectures to separately model atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters. These methods often require customized diffusion processes and conditional denoising, which can introduce additional model complexities and inconsistencies. Here we introduce DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that jointly learns the distribution of all structural components in crystalline materials. With crystal structure representation as unified 2D matrices, DiffCrysGen bypasses the need for task-specific priors or decoupled modules, enabling end-to-end generation of atom types, fractional coordinates, and lattice parameters within a single framework. Our model learns crystallographic symmetry and chemical validity directly from large-scale datasets, allowing it to scale to complex materials discovery tasks. As a demonstration, we applied DiffCrysGen to the design of rare-earth-free magnetic materials with high saturation magnetization, showing its effectiveness in generating stable, diverse, and property-aligned candidates for sustainable magnet applications.</p>

            <h2>Unraveling the impact of competing interactions on non-equilibrium colloidal gelation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joeri Opdam, Michio Tateno, Hajime Tanaka</p>
            <p>Competing interactions stabilize exotic mesoscopic structures, yet the microscopic mechanisms by which they influence non-equilibrium processes leading to disordered states remain largely unexplored, despite their critical role in self-assembly across a range of nanomaterials and biological systems. Here, we numerically investigate the structural evolution in charged colloidal model systems, where short-range attractions and long-range repulsions compete. We reveal that these two interaction scales drive sequential ordering within clusters, from tetrahedra motifs to linear aggregates with chiral order. This process disrupts early-stage percolated networks, resulting in reentrant behavior -- a dynamic transition from disordered cluster to network to chiral rigid cluster. On the other hand, the cluster-elastic network boundary in the final state is governed by isostatic percolation, which slows structural rearrangements, preserves branching points, and sustains a long-lived network. The resulting structure consist of rigid Bernal spiral-like branches connected through flexible branching points lacking order. These insights advance our microscopic understanding of out-of-equilibrium ordering driven by competing interactions, particularly phenomena like temporally delayed frustration reflecting different length scales of competing interactions. The mechanisms identified here may play a crucial role in mesoscale self-organization across soft materials, from nanoparticle assemblies to biological gels and cytoskeletal networks. Understanding how competing interactions regulate structure and dynamics could guide the design of adaptive materials with tunable mechanical properties and offer new perspectives on biological processes such as cytoplasmic organization and cellular scaffolding.</p>

            <p>Single crystals are essential for characterizing a wide range of magnetic states, including exotic ones such as quantum spin liquids. This study reports a flux method for growing single crystals of NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, the first quantum spin liquid candidate on a triangular spin lattice with dominant Ising like spin correlations. Purple NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ single crystals with hexagonal morphology were successfully grown using a K$_2$Mo$_3$O$_{10}$-B$_2$O$_3$ flux. With lateral sizes up to 3.5 mm and a thickness up to 2 mm, these are the largest dimensions reported to date. The chemical composition was confirmed by powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction along with scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Aiming for an accurate determination of the magnetic anisotropy and its effect on the magnetic properties, NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ crystals were additionally analyzed by magnetic susceptibility, revealing a substantial anisotropy without long-range magnetic ordering down to 2 K. Single crystals of two novel rare-earth heptatantalates, ErTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and GdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, were also grown and their magnetic properties investigated. The magnetic anisotropy of ErTa$_7$O$_{19}$ closely resembles that of isostructural NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, indicating a possibility of a similar exotic magnetic ground state. In contrast, GdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ shows paramagnetic behavior, consistent with previous results obtained for polycrystalline samples.</p>

            <p>The band inversion transition in a cylindrical HgTe nanowire is inducible via varying the nanowire radius. Here we derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian describing the band structure of the HgTe nanowire close to the fundamental band gap. Because both the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands have quadratic dependence on $k_{z}$ when the gap closes, we need to consider at least three subbands, i.e., the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands, in building the effective Hamiltonian. The resulted effective Hamiltonian is block diagonal and each block is a $3\times3$ matrix. End states are found in the inverted regime when we solve the effective Hamiltonian with open boundary condition.</p>

            <h2>Beyond the Octupole Approximation in Non-Collinear Antiferromagnetic Thin Films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Freya Johnson, Jan Zemen, Geri Topore, Michele Shelly Conroy, Shanglong Ning, Jiahao Han, Shunsuke Fukami, Chiara Ciccarelli, Lesley F. Cohen</p>
            <p>Noncollinear antiferromagnets offer much promise for antiferromagnetic spintronics and neuromorphic applications with a plethora of functional properties surpassing many competing magnetic systems. Films grown on mismatched substrates can relieve strain by the creation of slip-plane defects - and recently we have shown that these defects can manipulate global physical properties important for application. Here we demonstrate that post growth annealing results in near-defect-free, structurally robust films that allow the magnetic order thermal evolution to change as a function of film thickness. Strong spin-lattice coupling ensures that substrate clamping limits the ability of thinner films to transform as they are cooled to low temperature. However, beyond a certain thickness, films no longer suffer this constraint, revealing the extraordinary transformations that provide the pathway for spin to reach the lowest energy state. We show that this transition cannot be explained by the previously established mechanism of spin rotations in the (111) plane, and we calculate that rotations along the chirality-inverting [1-10] direction may be preferable under certain conditions. Our work suggests that chirality inverting rotations in these materials may have been previously overlooked in studies adopting the so-called octupole approximation of the net magnetic moment. This enriches the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics, raising the possibility of device designs with thickness engineered to exploit switching of chirality.</p>

            <p>Topological magnetic structures, such as Hopfions, are central to three-dimensional magnetism, but their characterization in complex geometries remains challenging. We introduce a robust finite-element method for calculating the Hopf index in micromagnetic simulations of three-dimensional nanostructures. By employing the Biot-Savart form for the vector potential, our approach ensures gauge-invariant results, even in multiply connected geometries like tori. A novel variance-based correction scheme significantly reduces numerical errors in highly inhomogeneous textures, achieving accurate Hopf index values with fast mesh-dependent convergence. We validate the method using an analytically defined Hopfion structure and demonstrate its ability to detect topological transitions through a simulation of a Hopfion's field-induced destruction into a toron, marked by an abrupt change in the Hopf index. This method enables precise quantification of topological features in complex three-dimensional magnetic textures forming in finite-element micromagnetic simulations, offering a powerful tool for advancing topological magnetism studies in general geometries.</p>

In two dimensions, melting is predicted to be distinct, proceeding through partially ordered nematic and hexatic states that are neither liquid nor crystal. Here we measure and explain how continuous, hexatic melting of incommensurate CDWs occurs in low-dimensional materials. As a CDW is thermally excited, disorder emerges progressively$\unicode{x2013}$initially through smooth elastic deformations that modulate the local wavelength, and subsequently via the nucleation of topological defects. Experimentally, we track three hallmark signatures of CDW melting$\unicode{x2013}$azimuthal superlattice peak broadening, wavevector contraction, and integrated intensity decay.</p>

            <p>The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</p>

            <p>Mesoscopic Coulomb blockade (MCB) is recognized as a phase-coherent variant of the conventional Coulomb blockade that arises in systems with open contacts. In open quantum dots, MCB is enhanced by a decrease in background conductance. This occurs because the reduction in coupling strength between the quantum dot and the outer reservoir renders the system more closed, thereby facilitating the emergence of conventional Coulomb blockade. In this work, we demonstrate that the MCB in open superconducting islands exhibits an different correlation with coupling strength compared to open quantum dots. Specifically, a decrease in background conductance may result in a weakening of the MCB. This observation indicates that the MCB in superconducting islands originates from the presence of superconducting-normal interfaces.</p>

            <p>We conduct a theoretical investigation into explosive growth of bistability in a cavity magnonic system incorporating magnetic nonlinearity. In this system, the coupling between the magnon and photon generates the cavity magnon polaritons. When driving the photon-like polariton mode, the bistability can undergo a sudden transition with the increase of the driving power, resulting in an explosive growth of the bistable region by several times. Conversely, driving the magnon-like polariton mode only gives rise to normal bistability. This depends on whether the minimum driving power required to generate the bistability is non-monotonic with respect to the driving frequency. In addition, despite driving only the photon-like polariton mode, the photon- and magnon-like polariton modes can show simultaneous explosive growth of the bistability in microwave transmission, owing to the light-matter interaction. Our research sheds light on the hidden side of the nonlinear cavity magnonic system and provides a potential application for cavity spintronic devices founded on this novel feature.</p>

            <p>Thermal transport in nanoscale interconnects is dominated by intricate electron-phonon interactions and microstructural influences. As copper faces limitations at the nanoscale, tungsten and ruthenium have emerged as promising alternatives due to their substantial phonon contributions to thermal conductivity. Metals with stronger phonon-mediated thermal transport are particularly advantageous in nanoscale architectures, where phonons are less sensitive to size effects than electrons. Here, we show that phonons play a comparable role to electrons in the thermal transport of ruthenium and tungsten thin films, evidenced by deviations from the classical Wiedemann-Franz law. Elevated Lorenz numbers-1.9 and 2.7 times the Sommerfeld value for ruthenium and tungsten, respectively-indicate phonon contributions of 45% and 62% to total thermal conductivity. Comparisons of in-plane thermal conductivity from steady-state thermoreflectance and electron relaxation times from infrared ellipsometry reveal that phonon-mediated transport is insensitive to microstructural variations and scaling. Ultrafast infrared pump-probe measurements show that ruthenium exhibits a higher electron-phonon coupling factor than tungsten, consistent with the differing contributions of carriers to thermal transport. Molecular dynamics simulations and spectral energy density analysis confirm substantial phonon-driven thermal transport and mode-dependent phonon lifetimes. These results offer insights into phonon-driven thermal transport and provide design principles for selecting interconnects with enhanced thermal management.</p>

Gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setups in acid media aiming at H2O2 formation were also performed. The 3% {\delta}-MnO2/C and 1% {\alpha}-MnO2/C electrocatalysts were more efficient and selective than pure Vulcan XC-72 through the ORR 2-electron pathway in the RRDE essays. Concerning H2O2 electrogeneration using GDE, the 1% {\alpha}-MnO2/C electrocatalyst displayed better activity, with peroxide accumulation of 402.6 mg/L at -1.9 V (vs Ag/AgCl) after 120 min, 48 % higher than pure Vulcan XC-72 GDE. These results can be ascribed to a synergistic effect between {\alpha}-MnO2 and Vulcan XC-72, as well as oxygen functional acid species improvement, increasing electrocatalytic surface hydrophilicity and enhancing H2O2 electrosynthesis.</p>

Tuning the transverse field $h$ and the dilution $p$, the quantum phase diagram of both models is explored. Both quantum phase diagrams show long-range order for small $h$ and small $p$. The ordered phase of each is separated from the disordered (quantum) Griffiths phase by second-order phase transitions on two critical lines touching at a multi-critical point. Using Binder ratios we locate quantum critical points with high accuracy. The order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the average correlation-length exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ are determined along the critical lines and at the multi-critical points for the first time via finite-size scaling. We find three internally consistent sets of critical exponents and compare them with potentially connected universality classes. The quantum Griffiths phase in the vicinity of the phase transition lines is analyzed through the local susceptibility. Our results indicate that activated scaling occurs not only at the percolation transition, but also at the phase transition line for $p$ smaller than the percolation threshold $p_c$.</p>

            <p>Metal oxide resists (MORs) have shown great promise for high resolution patterning in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, with potential for integration into high volume manufacturing. However, MORs have recently been shown to exhibit sensitivity to process conditions and environment, leading to critical dimension (CD) variation. While this variation can be reduced with proper process control, there is little knowledge on how these aspects affect the image formation mechanism. To bridge these knowledge gaps, we deploy a coordinated, fundamentals-focused approach to yield deep insights into MOR exposure and process chemistry. Our results on a model MOR, an n-butyl Sn-Oxo system, reveal how parameters such as exposure dose, post-exposure bake temperature, and atmospheric species influence the image formation mechanism. Our results, and the coordinated approach using correlative spectroscopies, provide a strong foundation for understanding the image formation mechanism in MOR materials with potential to link mechanistic aspects to CD variation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyungeun Kim, Christian D. Santangelo</p>
            <p>The isometric embedding of surfaces in three-dimensional space is fundamental to various physical systems, from elastic sheets to programmable materials. While continuous surfaces typically admit unique solutions under suitable boundary conditions, their discrete counterparts-represented as networks of vertices connected by edges-can exhibit multiple distinct embeddings for identical edge lengths. We present a systematic approach to constructing discrete meshes that yield a controlled number of embeddings. By analyzing the relationship between mesh connectivity and embedding multiplicity through rigidity theory, we develop criteria for designing meshes that minimize solution multiplicity. We demonstrate computational methods based on local matrix operations and trilateration techniques, enabling practical implementation for meshes with approximately a thousand vertices. Our analysis provides both theoretical bounds on the number of possible embeddings based on Bézout's theorem and practical guidelines for mesh construction in physical applications. Through numerical simulations, we show that this approach achieves comparable accuracy to traditional minimization methods while offering computational advantages through sequential computation. Importantly, we demonstrate that in cases where a unique smooth solution exists, local fluctuations in reconstructed shapes derived from the computational grid can serve as indicators of insufficient geometric constraints. This work bridges the gap between discrete and continuous embedding problems, providing insights for applications in 4D printing, mechanical meta-materials, and deployable structures.</p>

Using amorphous In2O3 as an example, we demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in reproducing the band-like nature of the conduction electrons as well as their disorder-limited mobility.

We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for the continuous tuning of dimerization patterns and disorder strength. We identify different distinct ergodicity-breaking regimes within the parameter space constrained by our geometry. Notably, one of these regimes exhibits a unique feature in which non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) properties of the ground state extend to a noticeable fraction of states across the entire spectrum. This interplay between localization and SPT makes the system particularly interesting, as localization should help with stabilization of topological excitations, while SPT states contribute to an additional delocalization. Other regions of parameters correspond to more standard nonergodic dynamics resembling many-body localization.</p>

            <h2>Pyrite Bismuth Telluride Heterojunction for Hybrid Electromagnetic to Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting</h2>

            <p>The rapid proliferation of wireless networks and connected devices has led to pervasive electromagnetic (EM) energy dissipation into the environment, an underutilized resource for energy harvesting. Here, we demonstrate a pyrite (FeS$_2$)-bismuth telluride (Bi$_2$Te$_3$) heterojunction that enables hybrid electromagnetic-to-thermoelectric energy conversion. Fabricated via a simple cold-press compaction of powders, the heterojunction forms a Schottky interface at FeS$_2$, facilitating efficient RF absorption and localized heating. This heat is harvested by Bi$_2$Te$_3$ through thermoelectric conversion. Under 35~MHz RF irradiation at 1~W input power, the device achieved a local temperature rise of 46~$^\circ$C and a thermal gradient of 5.5~K across the Bi$_2$Te$_3$, resulting in a peak power density of approximately 13~mW/cm$^2$. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate the heat transport behavior and interfacial thermoelectric performance. This work introduces a new class of heterostructures for RF-responsive energy harvesting, offering a scalable route toward self-powered IoT and wireless sensing systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mayada Fadel, Joshua Quinton, Mani Chandra, Mayank Gupta, Yuan Ping, Ravishankar Sundararaman</p>
            <p>We introduce a computational framework for first-principles density matrix transport within the Wigner function formalism to predict transport of quantum-mechanical degrees of freedom such as spin over long time and length scales. This framework facilitates simulation of spin dynamics and transport from first principles, while accounting for electron-phonon scattering at device length scales. We demonstrate this framework to elucidate the impact of various spin-orbit field profiles, such as Rashba and persistent spin helix, on coherent spin transport in several materials. Using graphene under an electric field as an example to illustrate the impact of electron-phonon scattering on incoherent transport, we show how the transport changes with the strength of scattering. We identify three distinct regimes of incoherent spin transport corresponding to the free induction decay, Dyakonov-Perel and Elliott-Yafet regimes of spin relaxation. In particular, we show that the spin diffusion length is insensitive to the strength of scattering within the Dyakonov-Perel regime.</p>

            <h2>Mapping of Microstructure Transitions during Rapid Alloy Solidification Using Bayesian-Guided Phase-Field Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Mancias, Brent Vela, Juan Flórez-Coronel, Rouhollah Tavakoli, Douglas Allaire, Raymundo Arróyave, Damien Tourret</p>
            <p>This study addresses microstructure selection mechanisms in rapid solidification, specifically targeting the transition from cellular/dendritic to planar interface morphologies under conditions relevant to additive manufacturing. We use a phase-field model that quantitatively captures solute trapping, kinetic undercooling, and morphological instabilities across a broad range of growth velocities ($V$) and thermal gradients ($G$), and apply it to a binary Fe-Cr alloy, as a surrogate for 316L stainless steel. By combining high-fidelity phase-field simulations with a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian active learning approach, we efficiently map the microstructure transitions in the multi-dimensional space of composition, growth velocity, and temperature gradient. We compare our PF results to classical theories for rapid solidification. The classical KGT model yields an accurate prediction of the value of $G$ above which the interface is planar for any growth velocity. Microstructures transition from dendrites to cells as the temperature gradient increases close to this value of $G$. We also identify the occurrence of unstable "intermediate" microstructures at the border between dendritic and planar at low $G$, in the absence of banding instability in this Fe-Cr alloy. Our results highlight the capabilities of Bayesian-guided PF approaches in exploring complex microstructural transitions in multidimensional parameters spaces, thereby providing a robust computational tool for designing process parameters to achieve targeted microstructures and properties in rapidly solidified metallic alloys.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. S. Alekseev, M. A. Semina</p>
            <p>In two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the inter-particle interaction can lead to the formation of a viscous electron fluid and realization of the hydrodynamic regime of electron transport. Here a nonlinear model of the electron hydrodynamic transport is constructed based on the accounting of pair correlations in the electron dynamics. When describing these systems within the framework of classical kinetics, such correlations represent subsequent ``extended'' collisions of the same electrons temporarily joined into pairs. We study their influence on stationary magnetotransport for large-amplitude fluid flows in long samples. Current profiles in the nonlinear regime and the corresponding differential magnetoresistance are calculated. Pair correlations lead to a characteristic nonmonotonic dependence of the differential resistance on magnetic field. We compare our results with experimental data on magnetoresistance of 2D electrons in high-purity GaAs quantum wells; our model can be responsible for a part of the observed features of the differential magnetoresistance.</p>

            <p>Understanding transition metal atoms' intercalation and diffusion behavior in two-dimensional (2D) materials is essential for advancing their potential in spintronics and other emerging technologies. In this study, we used density functional tight binding (DFTB) simulations to investigate the atomic-scale mechanisms of manganese (Mn) intercalation into NbSe$_2$ bilayers. Our results show that Mn prefers intercalated and embedded positions rather than surface adsorption, as cohesive energy calculations indicate enhanced stability in these configurations. Nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations revealed an energy barrier of 0.68 eV for the migration of Mn into the interlayer, comparable to other substrates, suggesting accessible diffusion pathways. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further demonstrated an intercalation concentration-dependent behavior. Mn atoms initially adsorb on the surface and gradually diffuse inward, resulting in an effective intercalation at higher Mn densities before clustering effects emerge. These results provide helpful insights into the diffusion pathways and stability of Mn atoms within NbSe$_2$ bilayers, consistent with experimental observations and offering a deeper understanding of heteroatom intercalation mechanisms in transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddhartha Sarkar, Xiaohan Wan, Ang-Kun Wu, Shi-Zeng Lin, Kai Sun</p>
            <p>In this Letter, we study topological flat bands with distinct features that deviate from conventional Landau level behavior. We show that even in the ideal quantum geometry limit, moire flat band systems can exhibit physical phenomena fundamentally different from Landau levels without lattices. In particular, we find new fractional quantum Hall states emerging from multi-band vortexable systems, where multiple exactly flat bands appear at the Fermi energy. While the set of bands as a whole exhibits ideal quantum geometry, individual bands separately lose vortexability, and thus making them very different from a stack of Landau levels. At certain filling fractions, we find fractional states whose Hall conductivity deviates from the filling factor. Through careful numerical and analytical studies, we rule out all known mechanisms--such as fractional quantum Hall crystals or separate filling of trivial and topological bands--as possible explanations. Leveraging the exact solvability of vortexable systems, we use analytic Bloch wavefunctions to uncover the origin of these new fractional states, which arises from the commensurability between the moire unit cell and the magnetic unit cell of an emergent effective magnetic field.</p>

            <p>We reveal a hidden electrodynamical structure emerging from a general $2\times2$ pseudo-Hermitian system that exhibits real spectra. Even when the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the Berry curvature can be mapped onto a $2+1$ dimensional electromagnetic field arising from an artificial spacetime instanton, in sharp contrast to the Hermitian systems where the Berry curvature is equivalent to the static magnetic field of a magnetic monopole in three spatial dimensions. The instanton appearing as a spacetime singularity carries a topological charge that quantizes the jump of magnetic flux of the Berry curvature at the time origin. Our findings are demonstrated in a simple example related to antiferromagnetic magnons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengwei Zhao, Gang v. Chen</p>
            <p>Distinct symmetry enriched topological orders often do not have classical distinctions. Motivated by the recent process on the pyrochlore spin ice materials based on the dipole-octupole doublets, we argue that dipolar spin liquid and octupolar spin liquid can be well differentiated through the magnetic charges of the magnetic monopoles in the classical spin ice regime. It is observed and predicted that, the long-range dipole-dipole interaction renders the magnetic monopole of the dipolar spin ice a finite magnetic charge via the dumbbell picture even in the classical regime. For the octupolar spin ice, however, a zero magnetic charge is expected from this mechanism in the classical regime. We expect this smoking-gun observation to resolve the debate on the nature of Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, and more broadly, this work may inspire further experiments and thoughts on the Ce-pyrochlore spin liquids, Nd-pyrochlore antiferromagnets, Er-based spinels, and the distinct properties of the emergent quasiparticles in various symmetry enriched topological phases.</p>

            <p>In the studied crystals of FeSe0.7 Te0.3 , a structural phase transition occurs in two stages. At higher temperatures, the electronic subsystem undergoes a reconstruction, leading to a significant increase in elastoresistance. 77 Se NMR data show an abrupt change in the relaxation rate during this transition. The final transition occurs at a temperature several degrees below and is also accompanied by anomalies in the electronic properties. Thus, in the Fe(Se,Te) series, similarly to the behavior of pure FeSe under pressure, the type of transition changes and intermediate state appear before the structural transition is suppressed. This similarity between the corresponding phase diagrams is explained by the same deformation of the iron coordination environment in Fe(Se,Te) compounds and in FeSe under pressure. Our findings provide new and significant information on the phase diagram of Fe(Se,Te) compounds and in particular suggest the possible existence of a triple point near the quantum critical point.</p>

            <p>Electron ptychography has recently achieved unprecedented resolution, offering valuable insights across diverse material systems, including in three dimensions. However, high-quality ptychographic reconstruction is computationally expensive and time consuming, requiring a significant amount of manually tuning even for experts. Additionally, essential tools for ptychographic analysis are often scattered across multiple software packages, with some advanced features available only in costly commercial software like MATLAB. To address these challenges, we introduce PtyRAD, an open-source software framework offers a comprehensive, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters--such as sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, and mixed probe and object modes--using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation (AD). By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieves up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. In addition, we propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around artifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional (2D) material datasets and vertical heterostructures. Moreover, PtyRAD integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow that streamlines hyperparameter selection. We hope the open-source nature of PtyRAD will foster reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in ptychographic imaging.</p>

            <h2>Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Campos Venuti, Jovan Odavić, Alioscia Hamma</p>
            <p>We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.</p>

            <p>The collapse of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) panels has attracted considerable public and academic interest. As detailed experimental data are not yet available and replicating the natural corrosion process requires years or decades, computational modelling is essential to understand under which conditions corrosion remains concealed. The very high porosity of RAAC is widely suspected to be a major contributing factor. However, current corrosion-induced cracking models are known to struggle with capturing the role of concrete porosity. To remedy this critical deficiency, we propose to enrich corrosion-induced cracking modelling with the analytical solution of reactive transport equations governing the precipitation of rust and a porosity-dependent description of diffusivity. With this, the corrosion concealment in RAAC panels is studied computationally for the first time, revealing that RAAC panels can suddenly collapse before any warning of corrosion-induced surface cracking and allowing to map the conditions most likely to result in sudden collapse.</p>

            <p>Simulating generic quantum states and dynamics is practically intractable using classical computers. However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.</p>

            <h2>Ultrastrong Light-Matter Coupling in Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niclas S. Mueller, Eduardo B. Barros, Stephanie Reich</p>
            <p>Ultrastrong light-matter coupling has traditionally been studied in optical cavities, where it occurs when the light-matter coupling strength reaches a significant fraction of the transition frequency. This regime fundamentally alters the ground and excited states of the particle-cavity system, unlocking new ways to control its physics and chemistry. However, achieving ultrastrong coupling in engineered cavities remains a major challenge. Here, we show that ultra- and deep-strong coupling naturally occur in bulk materials without the need for external cavities. By analyzing experimental data from over 70 materials, we demonstrate that phonon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaritons in many solids exhibit ultrastrong coupling, systematically surpassing the coupling strengths achieved in cavity-based systems. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a dipole lattice model based on a generalized Hopfield Hamiltonian, which unifies photon-matter, matter-matter, and photon-photon interactions. The complete overlap between the photonic and collective dipole modes in the lattice enables ultrastrong coupling, leading to excited-state mixing, radiative decay suppression, and potential phase transitions into collective ground states. Applying our model to real materials, we show that it reproduces light-matter coupling across broad material classes and may underlie structural phase transitions that give rise to emergent phenomena such as ferroelectricity, insulator-to-metal transitions, and exciton condensation. Recognizing ultrastrong coupling as an intrinsic property of solids reshapes our understanding of light-matter interactions and opens new avenues for exploring quantum materials and exotic phases of matter.</p>

            <p>The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria demands development of novel and effective antimicrobial agents. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs), characterized by their unique star-shaped architecture and potent multivalent interactions, represent a promising solution. This study leverages molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of lipidation on SNAPPs' structural stability, membrane interactions, and antibacterial efficacy. We show that lipidation with hexanoic acid (C6), lauric acid (C12), and stearic acid (C18) enhances the {\alpha}-helical stability of SNAPP arms, facilitating deeper insertion into the hydrophobic core of bacterial membranes. Among the variants, C12-SNAPP exhibits the most significant bilayer disruption, followed by C6-SNAPP, whereas the excessive hydrophobicity of C18-SNAPP leads to pronounced arm back-folding towards the core, reducing its effective interaction with the bilayer and limiting its bactericidal performance. Additionally, potential of mean force (PMF) analysis reveals that lipidation reduces the free energy barrier for translocation through the bilipid membrane compared to non-lipidated SNAPPs. These findings underscore the critical role of lipidation in optimizing SNAPPs for combating MDR pathogens. By fine-tuning lipid chain lengths, this study provides a framework for designing next-generation antimicrobial agents to address the global antibiotic resistance crisis, advancing modern therapeutic strategies.</p>

We also benchmark the energetics of finite systems, contributing a new set of torsion scans with charged species and a new set of DLPNO-CCSD(T) references for the TorsionNet500 benchmark. We additionally train and benchmark MPNICE models for bulk inorganic crystals, focusing on structural ranking and mechanical properties.

            <p>Terahertz (THz) technology, a cornerstone of next-generation high-speed communication and sensing, has long been hindered by impedance mismatch challenges that limit device performance and applicability. These challenges become particularly pronounced when ultrasensitive two-dimensional (2D) materials are employed as the device substrate in the THz range, further complicating their integration into real-world applications. Furthermore, conventional antenna designs often fail to provide adequate matching across the extensive THz spectrum. In this work, we tackle these challenges using a procedural generation algorithm to design THz broadband antennas that satisfy specific performance criteria. Namely, the developed inverse design methodology enables customization for the target impedance value, bandwidth, and contact topology requirements. The proposed antenna achieves an improvement of up to 40\% in power transfer efficiency compared to traditional bow-tie antennas under realistic operating conditions. High-fidelity electromagnetic simulations validate these results, confirming the design's practicality for THz applications.

            <p>We developed an interpretability informed Bayesian optimization framework to optimize underwater acoustic coatings based on polyurethane elastomers with embedded metamaterial features. A data driven model was employed to analyze the relationship between acoustic performance, specifically sound absorption and the corresponding design variables. By leveraging SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a machine learning interpretability tool, we identified the key parameters influencing the objective function and gained insights into how these parameters affect sound absorption. The insights derived from the SHAP analysis were subsequently used to automatically refine the bounds of the optimization problem automatically, enabling a more targeted and efficient exploration of the design space. The proposed approach was applied to two polyurethane materials with distinct hardness levels, resulting in improved optimal solutions compared to those obtained without SHAP-informed guidance. Notably, these enhancements were achieved without increasing the number of simulation iterations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SHAP to streamline optimization processes by uncovering hidden parameter relationships and guiding the search toward promising regions of the design space. This work underscores the effectiveness of combining interpretability techniques with Bayesian optimization for the efficient and cost-effective design of underwater acoustic metamaterials under strict computational constraints and can be generalized towards other materials and engineering optimization problems.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is an intriguing phenomenon in which an extensive number of bulk eigenstates localize at the boundaries of a non-Hermitian system with non-reciprocal hoppings. Here we study the interplay of this effect and a defect in non-reciprocal one-dimensional lattices. We show that the interplay of the NHSE and defects is size-dependent. We demonstrate a novel class of hybrid skin-defect states in finite-size systems resulting from the coupling between the skin and defect states. Next, we consider a single defect in a topologically nontrivial lattice with time-reversal symmetry based on the non-reciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger configuration. We unveil how topologically nontrivial defect states and non-Hermiticity interplay by competing with each other, exhibiting a transition from topologically nontrivial defect states to skin states. In addition, we show that decreasing the defect strength can result in a transition from trivial defect states to skin states. Our work promotes the understanding of the interplay between defects and the NHSE, and especially the importance of the energy spectra of the system with the defect under periodic boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>In our previous paper [JHEP 10 (2020) 144], we found that the complex Langevin (CL) method works for QCD at finite density on the $16^3 \times 32$ lattice in the low-temperature high-density regime within the range $\mu / T = 1.6 - 9.6$ with $\mu$ and $T$ being the quark chemical potential and the temperature, which enabled us to see a clear trend towards the formation of the Fermi sphere. Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term. The spatial extent is $L = (1.3 - 2.7 {\rm ~fm} )> \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1} \sim 1{\rm ~fm}$, in contrast to our previous study with $L < \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1}$. We find that the CL method works in a broad region up to $\mu / T = 4.8$, while it starts to fail as we approach the phase boundary due to the singular drift problem, which can be understood qualitatively by extending the Banks-Casher relation to the case at finite density.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged boron vacancy center in 2D hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising quantum sensor. However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions.

            <h2>Geometry of Learning -- L2 Phase Transitions in Deep and Shallow Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ibrahim Talha Ersoy, Karoline Wiesner</p>
            <p>When neural networks (NNs) are subject to L2 regularization, increasing the regularization strength beyond a certain threshold pushes the model into an under-parameterization regime. This transition manifests as a first-order phase transition in single-hidden-layer NNs and a second-order phase transition in NNs with two or more hidden layers. This paper establishes a unified framework for such transitions by integrating the Ricci curvature of the loss landscape with regularizer-driven deep learning. First, we show that a curvature change-point separates the model-accuracy regimes in the onset of learning and that it is identical to the critical point of the phase transition driven by regularization. Second, we show that for more complex data sets additional phase transitions exist between model accuracies, and that they are again identical to curvature change points in the error landscape. Third, by studying the MNIST data set using a Variational Autoencoder, we demonstrate that the curvature change points identify phase transitions in model accuracy outside the L2 setting. Our framework also offers practical insights for optimizing model performance across various architectures and datasets. By linking geometric features of the error landscape to observable phase transitions, our work paves the way for more informed regularization strategies and potentially new methods for probing the intrinsic structure of neural networks beyond the L2 context.</p>

            <h2>Spatially Structured Flocking in a Proliferating Population of Self-Propelled Organisms without Explicit Alignment Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seiya Takamura, Nen Saito</p>
            <p>While it is well established that self-propelled particles with alignment interactions can exhibit orientational order, the impact of self-replication and annihilation, which are key characteristics in cellular systems, on spatiotemporal order remains poorly understood. To explore the interplay between self-propulsion and self-replication, we introduce the active Brownian bug (ABB) model, in which self-propelled agents undergo stochastic, density-dependent replication and constant-rate death. Despite the absence of alignment interactions, the system exhibits flocking behavior characterized by high orientational order, while maintaining ordered hexagonal arrays. This emergent order arises from stochastic birth and death processes, offering a novel mechanism for flocking in proliferating cellular populations.</p>

            <p>In this work, quantum gravity effects, which can potentially be measured in magnetometers through the Larmor frequency of atoms in an external magnetic field, are estimated. It is shown that the thermal motion of atoms can, in principle, produce measurable quantum gravity effects, given the precision of modern magnetometers. If the particle velocities are caused by some other mechanism, such as convection, it is shown that the quantum gravity effects may be observed with the magnetometer's proposed detection threshold. An actual state-of-the-art optical magnetometer experiment is being designed to search for these effects and is described in a companion paper by Maldaner et al. (2023) [1].</p>

            <h2>Surface tension estimation of bubble nuclei in magma using spinodal pressure and nonclassical nucleation theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mizuki Nishiwaki</p>
            <p>Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct estimation of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density (BND) from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental BND values.</p>

            <h2>Learning curves theory for hierarchically compositional data with power-law distributed features</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Cagnetta, Hyunmo Kang, Matthieu Wyart</p>
            <p>Recent theories suggest that Neural Scaling Laws arise whenever the task is linearly decomposed into power-law distributed units. Alternatively, scaling laws also emerge when data exhibit a hierarchically compositional structure, as is thought to occur in language and images. To unify these views, we consider classification and next-token prediction tasks based on probabilistic context-free grammars -- probabilistic models that generate data via a hierarchy of production rules. For classification, we show that having power-law distributed production rules results in a power-law learning curve with an exponent depending on the rules' distribution and a large multiplicative constant that depends on the hierarchical structure. By contrast, for next-token prediction, the distribution of production rules controls the local details of the learning curve, but not the exponent describing the large-scale behaviour.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Cagnetta, Alessandro Favero, Antonio Sclocchi, Matthieu Wyart</p>
            <p>How do neural language models acquire a language's structure when trained for next-token prediction? We address this question by deriving theoretical scaling laws for neural network performance on synthetic datasets generated by the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM) -- an ensemble of probabilistic context-free grammars designed to capture the hierarchical structure of natural language while remaining analytically tractable. Previously, we developed a theory of representation learning based on data correlations that explains how deep learning models capture the hierarchical structure of the data sequentially, one layer at a time. Here, we extend our theoretical framework to account for architectural differences. In particular, we predict and empirically validate that convolutional networks, whose structure aligns with that of the generative process through locality and weight sharing, enjoy a faster scaling of performance compared to transformer models, which rely on global self-attention mechanisms. This finding clarifies the architectural biases underlying neural scaling laws and highlights how representation learning is shaped by the interaction between model architecture and the statistical properties of data.</p>

            <p>Self-diffraction is a non-collinear four-wave mixing technique well-known in optics. We explore self-diffraction in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range, taking advantage of intense femtosecond EUV pulses produced by a free electron laser. Two pulses are crossed in a thin cobalt film and their interference results in a spatially periodic electronic excitation. The diffraction of one of the same pulses by the associated refractive index modulation is measured as a function of the EUV wavelength. A sharp peak in the self-diffraction efficiency is observed at the M$_{2,3}$ absorption edge of cobalt at 59 eV and a fine structure is found above the edge. The results are compared with a theoretical model assuming that the excitation results in an increase of the electronic temperature. EUV self-diffraction offers a potentially useful spectroscopy tool and will be instrumental in studying coherent effects in the EUV range.</p>

            <p>Complexity science offers a wide range of measures for quantifying unpredictability, structure, and information. Yet, a systematic conceptual organization of these measures is still missing. We present a unified framework that locates statistical, algorithmic, and dynamical measures along three axes (regularity, randomness, and complexity) and situates them in a common conceptual space. We map statistical, algorithmic, and dynamical measures into this conceptual space, discussing their computational accessibility and approximability. This taxonomy reveals the deep challenges posed by uncomputability and highlights the emergence of modern data-driven methods (including autoencoders, latent dynamical models, symbolic regression, and physics-informed neural networks) as pragmatic approximations to classical complexity ideals. Latent spaces emerge as operational arenas where regularity extraction, noise management, and structured compression converge, bridging theoretical foundations with practical modeling in high-dimensional systems. We close by outlining implications for physics-informed AI and AI-guided discovery in complex physical systems, arguing that classical questions of complexity remain central to next-generation scientific modeling.</p>

            <p>Surface defects in colloidal quantum dots are a major source of nonradiative losses, yet the microscopic mechanisms underlying exciton trapping and recombination remain elusive. Here, we develop a model Hamiltonian based on atomistic electronic calculations to investigate exciton dynamics in CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs containing a single hole trap introduced by an unpassivated sulfur atom. By systematically varying the defect depth and reorganization energy, we uncover how defect-induced excitonic states mediate energy relaxation pathways. Our simulations reveal that a single localized defect can induce a rich spectrum of excitonic states, leading to multiple dynamical regimes, from slow, energetically off-resonant trapping to fast, cascaded relaxation through in-gap defect states. Crucially, we quantify how defect-induced polaron shifts and exciton-phonon couplings govern the balance between efficient radiative emission and rapid nonradiative decay. These insights clarify the microscopic origin of defect-assisted loss channels and suggest pathways for tailoring QD optoelectronic properties via surface and defect engineering.</p>

            <p>In this work, we report an alcohol-induced surface charging route of colloidal QDs to achieve controllable electrophoretic deposition processing. By adding a fixed amounts of alcohols into a preformed quantum dots solution in non-polar solvents, the colloidal quantum dots can be positively charged, and then deposited on negative electrode under applied electric field. The surface charging of PbSe quantum dots was investigated by zeta potential, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and discrete Fourier transform calculations. It was found that the zeta potential of oleate acid capped PbSe QDs increases from +1.6 mV to +13.4 mV with the amount of alcohol solvent increasing. The alcohol-induced zeta potential increasing can be explained to the electron cloud shift of active hydrogen mediated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds between carboxy acid and alcohol. Considering the influence of surface charging of quantum dots on their dispersibility, we describe the microscopic mechanism of alcohol-induced electrophoretic deposition processing. Furthermore, we developed a size-selective separation protocol by controlling alcohol-induced electrophoretic deposition processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad N. Tahir, Honghui Shang, Xinguo Ren</p>
            <p>The random-phase approximation (RPA) formulated within the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation framework is a powerful approach to compute the ground-state energies and properties of molecules and materials. Its overall underbinding behavior can be effectively mitigated by a simple correction term, called renormalized single excitation (rSE) correction. Analytical gradient calculations of the RPA energy have become increasingly available, enabling structural relaxations and even molecular dynamics at the RPA level. However, such calculations at the RPA+rSE level have not been reported, due to the lack of the rSE analytical gradient. Here, we present the first formulation and implementation of the analytical gradients of the rSE energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates within an atomic-orbital basis set framework, which allows us to assess the performance of RPA+rSE in determining the molecular geometries and energetics. It is found that the slight overestimation behavior of RPA for small covalently bonded molecules is strengthened by rSE, while such behavior for molecules bonded with purely dispersion interactions is corrected. We further applied the approach to the water clusters, and found that the energy difference between the low-energy isomers of water hexamers is almost unchanged when going from RPA to RPA+rSE geometries. For the bigger WATER27 test set, using the RPA+rSE geometries instead of the RPA ones leads to a slight reduction of the mean absolute error of RPA+rSE from 0.91 kcal/mol to 0.70 kcal/mol, at the complete basis set.</p>

            <p>We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom imaging fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition. The demonstrated capabilities will play a key role in future quantum simulations and computing applications with ${}^{173}$Yb arrays.</p>

            <p>Development of lightweight materials with enhanced mechanical properties has been a long-standing challenge in science and engineering. Lightweight auxetic metastructures (AMSs) provide attractive solutions to this problem. AMSs' negative Poisson's ratio is a unique characteristic which results in very interesting practical properties such as high energy absorption and improved toughness. Different properties of metastrcutures, including anisotropy, are dependent, in addition to their original material, on the unit cell shape and geometrical features which have very high variations. Over the past few years, researchers have developed AMSs with various unit cells, either introducing new internal architecture or enhancing and optimizing the existing ones. Despite the progress made in this field, there is no comprehensive review of the AMS unit cells. This review describes the cellular AMSs associated with a classified set of metastructures, comprising more than 100 distinct auxetic repetitive unit cells. Besides, achievable range of negative Poisson's ratios are provided for different categories of AMSs. Finally, the future perspective of the research field and potential developments and applications in this field are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo-Yi Li, Yu-Ran Zhang</p>
            <p>Prethermal discrete time crystals (PDTCs), an emergent non-equilibrium phase of matter, have been studied in two- and higher-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions and one-dimensional (1D) lattices with long-range interactions. However, different from prethermalization that can be observed in 1D Floquet classical spin systems with NN interactions, classical PDTCs in Floquet 1D systems with only NN interactions have not been proposed before. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of disorder-free PDTCs in 1D Floquet classic spin systems with NN interactions. We show that the thermalization time grows exponentially as the driving frequency increases and depends on the energy density of the initial state, which are two key signatures of PDTCs. The robustness of 1D classical PDTC order is verified by introducing imperfect spin flip operations. The emergence of 1D classical PDTCs can be explained by mapping the 1D classical spin chain with NN interacting to a quantum spin-half system with effective long-range interactions. Our work provides an exploration of quantum characteristics, when considering the classical counterparts of quantum phenomena, and will be helpful for further investigations of both classical and quantum prethermal systems and discrete time-crystalline order.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transferability of machine learning interatomic potentials across concentration variations in chemically similar systems, using aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions as a case study. Despite containing identical chemical species (K$^+$, OH$^-$, H$_2$O) across all concentrations, models fine-tuned on specific KOH concentrations exhibit surprisingly poor transferability to others, with force prediction errors increasing dramatically from ~30 meV/A (at training concentration) to ~90 meV/A (at very different concentrations). This reveals a critical limitation when applying such models beyond their training domain, even within chemically homogeneous systems. We demonstrate that strategic selection of training data can substantially overcome these limitations without requiring extensive computational resources. Models fine-tuned on intermediate concentrations (6.26 mol/L) exhibit remarkable transferability across the entire concentration spectrum (0.56-17.98 mol/L), often outperforming more computationally expensive models trained on multiple concentration datasets. This approach enables accurate simulation of hydroxide transport dynamics across varying electrolyte conditions while maintaining near-quantum accuracy. Our simulations further reveal the emergence of hydroxide-hydroxide hydrogen bonding at high concentrations - a phenomenon not explicitly represented in dilute training data but successfully captured by our intermediate-concentration model. This work establishes practical guidelines for developing broadly applicable machine learning force fields with optimal transferability, challenging the assumption that diverse training datasets are always necessary for robust performance in similar chemical environments.</p>

We propose a new and simple constitutive relation for the hyperpressure to ensure that the models are both physically meaningful and mathematically well-posed. The framework is further extended to incorporate pressure-dependent viscosities. We show that for the pressure-dependent viscosity model, the inclusion of second-gradient effects guarantees the ellipticity of the governing pressure equation, in contrast to previous models rooted in classical continuum mechanics. The constant viscosity model is applied to steady cylindrical flows, where explicit solutions are derived under both strong and weak adherence boundary conditions. In each case, we establish convergence of the velocity profiles to the classical Navier-Stokes solutions as the model's characteristic length scales tend to zero.</p>

We discuss the Fuzzy Sphere estimates for the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of the lowest primary operator. Finally, we interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee-Yang CFT.

Applications span information processing, computation, quantum sensing, and dark-matter detection. This progress has driven the development of integrated non-reciprocal devices, which are essential for preventing unwanted feedback that can degrade system performance. While non-reciprocal devices have been realized in edge magnetoplasmon materials via classical interference effects, their operation is often complicated by a dependence on input power. Here, we demonstrate that topological circulators utilizing asymmetric coupling offer improved input power range, isolation, and insertion loss. In this configuration, non-reciprocal behavior arises from the coupling between a chiral edge magnetoplasmonic resonator and LC resonators, leading to non-Hermitian dynamics. The coherent photon-plasmon interaction enables a circulator with up to 50 dB of isolation across a broad range of excitation intensities. This is the first experimental demonstration showing that magnetic topological insulators can support the study of chiral plasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics at radio frequencies, underscoring their potential to enable chip-scale quantum-classical interfaces in superconducting quantum information processing systems.</p>

            <p>Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</p>

We also calculated the contribution of $S_4$ to be between 18% and 20% and not 27% as was calculated by Caux and Hagemans. In fact we show that the latter reference had also the normalization factor twice the correct value and had it done the numeric integrations correctly it would have obtained a contribution between 36% and 40% for $S_4$. Furthermore, we prove that its claim that our initial derivation of $S_4$ was also incorrect in its dependency on the spectral parameters is incorrect because fixing the momentun transfer $k$ up to $2\pi$ as the latter reference did to justify its claim only amounts to mutltiplying the overall factor by 2 because as we will prove in this paper $S_4$ is periodic in $k$ with period $2\pi$. Also in this paper we derive $S_n$ for general $n$ by following a different approach compared to our initial derivation of $S_4$. Although for $S_4$ both the new derivation and the initial one lead to equivalent formulas that are expressed differently, the new form presented in this paper is much more elegant and compact and also reveals new hidden and nontrivial symmetries which substantially simplify the numeric evaluation of $S_4$ and its sum rules. Moreover based on the results of this paper we propose a simple approximation to the total DSF of the Heisenberg model. Finally we comment on how our work might resolve the discrepancy between the exact theoretic results and experiemntal data as reported by Zaliznyak et al.</p>

            <h2>New experimental evidence for Podkletnov effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.V. Fetisov</p>
            <p>In the works of E. Podkletnov et al. (for example [Physica C: Superconductivity, 1992, Vol. 203, p. 441]), a unique experiment is described in which a significant reduction in the weight of various test bodies was observed when placed above a rotating disk made of the superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+delta (YBCO); the disk was in the superconducting state (at 20-70 K) and was subjected to an alternating (50 Hz-100 MHz) magnetic field. Numerous attempts to replicate this experiment in other laboratories have been unsuccessful; however, a broad discussion has been initiated regarding the possible nature of the "Podkletnov effect" - the weight loss of objects located above the superconductor. In the present experimental work, results similar to the Podkletnov effect have been obtained, which, however, occur at room temperature. During our experiments, gas-tight containers with the crystal hydrate K2CO3X1.5H2O and dispersed YBCO exhibited a sharp loss of part of their weight during and after 0.5 hours of exposure to a magnetic field with a frequency of 50 MHz. Changes in the weight of various test bodies located in close proximity to the containers were recorded. It was found that these weight changes correlate with the external surface area of the bodies and do not depend on their chemical nature. A dependence of the magnitude of weight changes on the oxygen content in YBCO was obtained, which shows a significant dip in the region where superstructural orderings of the oxygen sublattice exist in the basal plane. This dip coincides in shape with the well-known dip in the dependence of Tc on delta (the "60-K plateau"). The possible connection between these two extraordinary phenomena coexisting in YBCO compounds - inexplicable weight changes and high-temperature superconductivity - is discussed.</p>

            <p>Quantum interference can deeply alter the nature of many-body phases of matter. In the paradigmatic case of the Hubbard model, Nagaoka famously proved that introducing a single itinerant charge can transform a paramagnetic insulator into a ferromagnet through path interference. However, a microscopic observation of such kinetic magnetism induced by individually imaged dopants has been so far elusive. Here we demonstrate the emergence of Nagaoka polarons in a Hubbard system realized with strongly interacting fermions in a triangular optical lattice. Using quantum gas microscopy, we reveal these polarons as extended ferromagnetic bubbles around particle dopants arising from the local interplay of coherent dopant motion and spin exchange. In contrast, kinetic frustration due to the triangular geometry promotes antiferromagnetic polarons around hole dopants, as proposed by Haerter and Shastry. Our work augurs the exploration of exotic quantum phases driven by charge motion in strongly correlated systems and over sizes that are challenging for numerical simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephen Whitelam</p>
            <p>The Jarzynski equality allows the calculation of free-energy differences using values of work measured from nonequilibrium trajectories. The number of trajectories required to accurately estimate free-energy differences in this way grows sharply with the size of work fluctuations, motivating the search for protocols that perform desired transformations with minimum work. However, protocols of this nature can involve varying temperature, to which the Jarzynski equality does not apply. We derive a variant of the Jarzynski equality that applies to varying-temperature protocols, and show that it can have better convergence properties than the standard version of the equality. We derive this modified equality, and the associated fluctuation relation, within the framework of Markovian stochastic dynamics, complementing related derivations done within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics.</p>

            <h2>First-Passage Time for Upper Bounds on Fluctuations of Trajectory Observables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. V. Ryazanov</p>
            <p>General upper bounds on fluctuations of trajectory observables were recently obtained. It turned out that the size of fluctuations of dynamical observable is limited from below and from above. For the moment generating function of general upper bounds on the size of fluctuations, the moments (average value and variance) of the size of fluctuations are obtained. A more complex and interesting task is to obtain the first-passage time for process of upper bounds on the moments and first-passage time (FPT) of the observable A, which are obtained by calculating the moments and FPT of the process of upper bound. Characteristic functions, average values and variances of the first-passage time of reaching fluctuations of observables of the trajectory of the Markov chain of positive and negative levels are also obtained. Some general issues of the relationship between the theory of random processes (using the example of the risk theory used) and thermodynamics of trajectories are also considered.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrycja Łydżba, Rafał Świętek, Marcin Mierzejewski, Marcos Rigol, Lev Vidmar</p>
            <p>Eigenstate thermalization has been numerically shown to occur for few-body observables in a wide range of nonintegrable models. For intensive sums of few-body observables, a weaker version of eigenstate thermalization known as weak eigenstate thermalization has been proved to occur in general. Here, we unveil a stricter weak eigenstate thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models exhibiting quantum chaos in the single-particle sector (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in integrable interacting models. In such models, we argue that few-body observables that have a properly defined system-size independent norm are guaranteed to exhibit at least a polynomially vanishing variance (over the entire many-body energy spectrum) of the diagonal matrix elements, a phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. We prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the three-dimensional Anderson model in the delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for the integrable interacting spin-1/2 XYZ and XXZ models.</p>

            <p>Strongly correlated materials feature multiple electronic orbitals which are crucial to accurately understand their many-body properties, from cuprate materials to twisted bilayer graphene. In such multi-band models, quantum interference can lead to dispersionless bands whose large degeneracy gives rise to itinerant magnetism even with weak interactions. Here, we report on signatures of a ferrimagnetic state realized in a Lieb lattice at half-filling, characterized by antialigned magnetic moments with antiferromagnetic correlations, concomitant with a finite spin polarization. We demonstrate their robustness when increasing repulsive interactions from the non-interacting to the Heisenberg regime, and study their emergence when continuously tuning the lattice unit cell from a square to a Lieb geometry. Our work paves the way towards exploring exotic phases in related multi-orbital models such as quantum spin liquids in kagome lattices and heavy fermion behavior in Kondo models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqi Yang, Dawei Zhai, Tixuan Tan, Feng-Ren Fan, Zuzhang Lin, Wang Yao</p>
            <p>In the search of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, the conventional wisdom is to start from a flat Chern band isolated from the rest of the Hilbert space by band gaps, so that many-body interaction can be projected to a landscape that mimics a Landau level. Singular flat bands (SFB), which share protected touching points with other dispersive bands, represent another type of flat landscapes differing from Landau levels and Chern bands in topological and geometric properties. Here we report the finding of FQAH phases in a SFB, which emerges in the bipartite limit of the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. At 1/3 and 2/3 filling of the SFB, FQAH effects are demonstrated using density matrix renormalisation group calculations with all bands, as well as exact diagonalization calculations with the two touching bands. Gapping the band touching can turn the SFB into a nearly flat Chern band, but counter-intuitively this suppresses the FQAH effect, as the gap opening introduces strong inhomogeneity to the quantum geometry. An optical scheme to realize such SFB for cold atoms is provided. Our findings uncover a new arena for the exploration of fractional quantum Hall physics beyond the Landau level and Chern insulator paradigms.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum evolution of one-dimensional Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both theoretically and experimentally. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behaviors of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. We show that the hydrodynamization epoch is itself characterized by two independent timescales, an oscillation period and an observable-dependent damping time. We also show how the existence of a hydrodynamization epoch depends on the exact nature of the high-energy quench. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiongzhi Zheng, Zheng Chang, Changpeng Lin, Chongjia Lin, Yanguang Zhou, Baoling Huang, Ruiqiang Guo, Geoffroy Hautier</p>
            <p>Fundamentally understanding the lattice dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites remains elusive, primarily due to their strong anharmonicity and frequent phase transitions. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the thermal transport behavior in cubic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3, integrating first principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics with a linearized Wigner transport formula. The Temperature Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) technique allows us to stabilize the negative soft modes, primarily dominated by organic cations, at finite temperatures in cubic FAPbI3. We then predict an ultra-low thermal conductivity of ~0.63 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) in cubic FAPbI3 at 300 K, with a temperature dependence of T^(-0.740), suggesting a good crystalline nature of phonon transport. Notably, the ultra-low thermal conductivity in cubic FAPbI3 is primarily attributed to the [PbI3]1- units, challenging the conventional focus on organic FA+ cations. This shift in focus is due to the presence of Pb(s)-I(p) anti-bonding sates within the [PbI3]1- units. Furthermore, thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 is predominantly governed by the particle-like phonon propagation channel across the entire temperature range of 300-500 K, a result of diminished suppression of low-frequency phonons by FA+ cations and large inter-branch spacings. Finally, our findings underscore that the anharmonic force constants are highly temperature-sensitive, leading to underestimations of thermal conductivity when relying on 0-K anharmonic force constants. Our study not only elucidates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 but also provides a crucial framework for the discovery, design, and understanding of hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with ultra-low thermal conductivity.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic theory for electron-phonon coupling in twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziyan Zhu, Thomas P. Devereaux</p>
            <p>The origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene -- whether phonon-driven or electron-driven -- remains unresolved, in part due to the absence of a quantitative and efficient model for electron-phonon coupling (EPC). In this work, we develop a first-principles-based microscopic theory to calculate EPC in twisted bilayer graphene for arbitrary twist angles without requiring a periodic moiré supercell. Our approach combines a momentum-space continuum model for both electronic and phononic structures with a generalized Eliashberg-McMillan theory beyond the adiabatic approximation. Using this framework, we find that the EPC is strongly enhanced near the magic angle. The superconducting transition temperature induced by low-energy phonons peaks at $1.1^\circ$ around 1 K, and remains finite for a range of angles both below and above the magic angles. We predict that superconductivity persists up to $\sim 1.4^\circ$, where superconductivity has been recently observed despite the dispersive electronic bands. Beyond a large density of states, we identify a key condition for strong EPC: resonance between the electronic bandwidth and the dominant phonon frequencies. We also show that the EPC strength of a specific phonon corresponds to the modification of the moiré potential. In particular, we identify several $\Gamma$-phonon branches that contribute most significantly to the EPC, which are experimentally detectable via Raman spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>In the strong electron-electron (e-e) interaction limit each atomic site is constrained to be either empty or singly occupied. One can treat this scenario by fractionalizing the electrons into spin and charge degrees of freedom. We use the coherent state symbols associated with the lowest irreducible representation of the $su(2|1)$ superalgebra spanned by the Hubbard operators to solve the proposed models, as they implicitly take into account both the single particle occupation constraint and the fractionalization of the electrons. As an example, using the proposed method we solve the one dimensional Kitaev chain and two-dimensional BCS-Hubbard model to show the emergence of topological properties. The proposed procedure is quite general and can be used to analyze different lattice Hamiltonian, provided strong e-e correlation excludes doubly occupied states.</p>

            <p>We theoretically propose a possibility of realizing high $T_c$ superconductivity having $s\pm$-wave symmetry in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$. We consider situations where the original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a significant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates having tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our phonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the interaction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie just below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where the sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter bands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the large energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the absence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.</p>

            <p>Loop current order has been suggested as a promising candidate for the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ charge density wave (CDW) revealed in vanadium-based kagomé metals \avs\ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) near van Hove filling $n_\text{vH} = 5/12$. Weak-coupling analyses and mean field calculations have demonstrated that nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_2$ drives, respectively, real and imaginary bond-ordered CDW, with the latter corresponding to time-reversal symmetry breaking loop current CDW. It is important to understand the inter-layer correlation of these bond-ordered CDWs and its consequences in the bulk kagomé materials. To provide physical insights, we investigate in this paper the $c$-axis stacking of them, loop current CDW in particular, on the minimal bilayer kagomé lattice. The bare susceptibilities for stacking of real and imaginary bond orders are calculated for the free electrons on the bilayer kagomé lattice with inter-layer coupling $t_\perp=0.2t$, which splits the van Hove filling to $n_{+\text{vH}}=4.64/12$ and $n_{-\text{vH}}=5.44/12$. While real and imaginary bond-ordered CDWs are still favored, respectively, by $V_1$ and $V_2$, their inter-layer coupling is sensitive to band filling $n$. They tend to stack symmetrically near $n_{\pm\text{vH}}$ with identical bond orders in the two layers and give rise to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 1c_0$ CDW. On the other hand, they prefer to stack antisymmetrically around $n_\text{vH}$ with opposite bond orders in the two layers and lead to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 2c_0$ CDW. The concrete bilayer $t$-$t_\perp$-$V_1$-V$_2$ model is then studied. We obtain the mean-field ground states and determine the inter-layer coupling as a function of band filling at various interactions. The nontrivial topological properties of loop current CDWs are studied ...</p>

The minimization of the elastic magnetic energy plus electronic thermodynamic potential indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic interaction larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall configuration the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall configurations the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The thermodynamic potential and conductance of Bloch and Néel magnetic domain walls are identical within this prototype model.</p>

            <p>Activity-mediated unjamming of a confluent glassy system is crucial for several biological processes, such as embryogenesis and cancer metastasis. During these processes, the cells progressively change their junction properties, characterized by an interaction parameter $p_0$, and become motile. Here, we study the effect of nonequilibrium active fluctuations, in the form of self-propulsion, on the glassy dynamics in a confluent system. We simulate the active Vertex model and use the analytical mode-coupling theory (MCT) to show that the nature of the transition in the presence of activity remains similar to that in a thermal system where the fluctuations are temperature-like. The agreement of the simulation results with the MCT predictions demonstrates that the structure-dynamics feedback mechanism controls the relaxation dynamics. In addition, we present the first computation of a dynamic length scale, $\xi_d$, in confluent systems using finite-size scaling, and show that the growing relaxation time exhibita a power-law dependence on $\xi_d$. Furthermore, unlike particulate glasses, the static length that governs the finite-size scaling of the relaxation time is proportional to $\xi_d$, revealing the unique nature of the glassy dynamics in confluent systems.</p>

We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AF. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matías Bejas, Xianxin Wu, Debmalya Chakraborty, Andreas P. Schnyder, Andrés Greco</p>
            <p>Almost four decades of intense research have been invested to study the physics of high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors. The recent discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelates and its potential similarities with cuprate superconductors may open a new window to understand this long-standing problem. We have studied the proposed bilayer $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model [where $J_\parallel$ ($J_\perp$) is the in-plane (out-of-plane) magnetic exchange] in a large-$N$ approach on the basis of the path integral representation for Hubbard operators, which allows to obtain results at mean-field and beyond mean-field level. We find that $J_\perp$ is a candidate for triggering high superconducting $T_c$ values at quarter filling (hole doping $\delta=0.5$) of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Beyond mean-field level, we find a new phase, an out-of-plane bond-order phase (z-BOP), triggered also by $J_\perp$. z-BOP develops below a critical temperature which decreases with increasing doping and vanishes at a quantum critical point below quarter filling. The occurrence of this phase and its competition with superconductivity leads to a superconducting dome-shaped behavior as a function of doping and as a function of $J_\perp$. Qualitative comparisons with the physics of cuprates and the recent literature on the new pressurized nickelates are given along the paper.</p>

            <p>We have drawn connections between the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the multi-orbit Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, emphasizing their similarities and differences regarding chaotic behaviors. The features of the spectral form factor, such as the dip-ramp-plateau structure and the adjacent gap ratio, indicate chaos in the disordered orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. One significant conclusion is that the plateau value of the out-of-time-order correlator, whether in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with two- or four-body interactions, or a disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, does not effectively differentiate between integrable and chaotic phases in many-body systems. This observation suggests a limitation in using out-of-time-order correlator plateau values as a diagnostic tool for chaos. Our exploration of these ideas provides a deeper understanding of how chaos arises in non-Fermi liquid systems and the tools we use to study it. It opens the door to further questions, particularly about whether there are more effective ways to distinguish between chaotic and integrable phases in these complex systems.</p>

            <p>In this study, we demonstrate that when a ferroelectric nematic is confined between two glass plates coated with ionic polymers, a modulated phase emerges in a narrow temperature range between the nematic and ferroelectric nematic phases. This modulated phase emerges from the nematic phase in a continuous manner and then transforms into the ferroelectric nematic phase via a first-order transition upon cooling. Using optical microscopy, we provide compelling evidence that this modulated phase corresponds to the theoretically predicted double splay nematic phase. In this phase, splay deformations alternate in two orthogonal directions oriented at 45° to the substrate surfaces, creating a modulation wavelength that is twice the thickness of the cell. Our experiments with different ionic coatings reveal that only polymeric cationic coatings effectively promote the formation of this phase, highlighting the critical role of electrical screening. These findings not only confirm the existence of the double splay nematic phase but also provide insights into the distinctive topological defects of this phase in confined geometries.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Faraday effect in 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shashi B. Mishra</p>
            <p>Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the spin contributions to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) in transition metals. The IFE depends on the d-electron filling and asymmetry between excited electron and hole spin moments. Our results reveal that even elements with smaller electron magnetic moments, like Os, can exhibit higher IFE due to greater electron-hole asymmetry. Pt shows the highest IFE in the 1-2 eV frequency range, while Os dominates in the 2-4 eV range. In addition, we demonstrate that the IFE of neighboring elements with similar crystal structures (e.g., Ir, Pt, and Au) can be tuned by adjusting their Fermi levels, indicating the importance of d-electron filling on IFE. Finally, we find that the trend in electron (or hole) contributions to the IFE closely follows that of the spin Hall conductivity, however, the total IFE involves more complex interactions.</p>

            <h2>The Dean-Kawasaki equation and stochastic density functional theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Illien</p>
            <p>The Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation, which is at the basis of stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), was proposed in the mid-nineties to describe the evolution of the density of interacting Brownian particles, which can represent a large number of systems such as colloidal suspensions, supercooled liquids, polymer melts, biological molecules, active or chemotactic particles, or ions in solution. This theoretical framework, which can be summarized as a mathematical reformulation of the coupled overdamped Langevin equations that govern the dynamics of the particles, has attracted a significant amount of attention during the past thirty years. In this review, I present the context in which this framework was introduced, and I recall the main assumptions and calculation techniques that are employed to derive the DK equation. Then, in the broader context of statistical mechanics, I show how SDFT is connected to other theories, such fluctuating hydrodynamics, macroscopic fluctuation theory, or mode-coupling theory. The mathematical questions that are raised by the DK equation are presented in a non-specialist language. In the last parts of the review, I show how the original result was extended in several directions, I present the different strategies and approximations that have been employed to solve the DK equation, both analytically and numerically. I finally list the different situations where SDFT was employed to describe the fluctuations of Brownian suspensions, from the physics of active matter to the description of charged particles and electrolytes.</p>

To inform such applications in various research fields, this review paper provides a detailed tutorial on each step of the analysis, terminologies, concepts underlying the method, and validation, as well as recent developments of extended and related methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhang Meng-Han, Guo Xuan, Dao-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>We present a graphene derivative displaying novel topological phenomena without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a collinear altermagnet. Band degeneracies in spin-split honeycomb antiferromagnets produce unique distribution patterns of Berry curvature and give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. The asymmetric Berry curvature due to spin splitting can be created by lifting the degeneracies, which concentrate intensely at Weyl points contributing to carrier dynamics with a large valley Hall effect. The altermagnetism breaks the intrinsic time-reversal symmetry, guaranteeing the formation of pairs of Weyl points associated with the internal spin structure chiralities. We investigate the evolution of Dirac and Weyl crossings, in which topological phase transitions are characterized by the high Chern numbers preserving the non-intersecting flows of Wannier centers over occupied bands. Our results yield unique degeneracy-protected states by leveraging the symmetry constraints, where corresponding experiments are illustrated to demonstrate the potential of advancing valleytronic devices via unconventional topological responses.</p>

            <p>Kagome metals with van Hove singularities near the Fermi level can host intriguing quantum phenomena such as chiral loop currents, electronic nematicity, and unconventional superconductivity. However, to our best knowledge, unconventional magnetic states driven by van Hove singularities--like spin-density waves--have not been observed experimentally in kagome metals. Here, we report the magnetic and electronic structure of the layered kagome metal CeTi3Bi4, where Ti kagome electronic structure interacts with a magnetic sublattice of Ce3+ Jeff = 1/2 moments. Neutron diffraction reveals an incommensurate spin-density wave ground state of the Ce3+ moments, coexisting with commensurate antiferromagnetic order across most of the temperature-field phase diagram. The commensurate component is preferentially suppressed by thermal fluctuations and magnetic field, yielding a rich phase diagram involving an intermediate single-Q spin-density wave phase. First-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy identify van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, with the observed magnetic propagation vectors connecting their high density of states, strongly suggesting a van Hove singularity-assisted spin-density wave. These findings establish kagome metals LnTi3Bi4 as a model platform where the characteristic electronic structure of the kagome lattice plays a pivotal role in magnetic order.</p>

            <p>InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has been recently demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting Josephson Junctions (JJs) and Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs). The InAsOI consists of an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic-electrically-insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer, which allows the electrical decoupling of surface-exposed adjacent devices together with a high critical current density integration. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, allowing an increased gate coupling with the transistor channel with consequent reduced gate operating voltages and leakages. As well as for Si-based FETs, integrating high-k gate insulators with JoFETs promises similar advantages in superconducting electronics. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. We found that both the ungated and gate-tunable electrical properties of the JoFETs are strongly dependent on the insulator chosen. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, from which an edge-peaked supercurrent density distribution was calculated.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jae-Mo Lihm, Samuel Poncé</p>
            <p>Electron-phonon coupling often dominates the electron spectral functions and carrier transport properties. However, studies of this effect in real materials have largely relied on perturbative one-shot methods due to the lack of a first-principles theoretical and computational framework. Here, we present a self-consistent theory and implementation for the nonperturbative calculations of spectral functions and conductivity due to electron-phonon coupling. Applying this method to monolayer InSe, we demonstrate that self-consistency qualitatively affects the spectral function and transport properties compared to state-of-the-art one-shot calculations and allows one to reconcile calculations with angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The developed method can be widely applied to materials with dominant electron-phonon coupling at a moderate computational cost.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Order-Disorder Phase Transitions Induced by Fluctuations Based on Network Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonglong Ding</p>
            <p>Both quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic phase transitions are probably induced by fluctuations, yet the specific mechanism through which fluctuations cause phase transitions remains unclear in existing theories. This paper summarizes different phases into combinations of three types of network structures based on lattice models transformed into network models. These three network structures correspond to ordered, boundary, and disordered conditions, respectively. By utilizing the transformation relationships satisfied by these three network structures and classical probability, this work derive the high-order detailed balance relationships satisfied by strongly correlated systems. Using the high-order detailed balance formula, this work obtain the weights of the maximum entropy network structures in general cases. Consequently, I clearly describe the process of ordered-disordered phase transitions based on fluctuations and provide critical exponents and phase transition points. Finally, I verify this theory using the Ising model in different dimensions, the frustration scenario of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model, and the expectation of ground-state energy in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.</p>

            <p>Nodal-line semimetals are a class of topological materials hosting one dimensional lines of band degeneracy. Kramers nodal-line (KNL) metals/semimetals have recently been theoretically recognized as a class of topological states inherent to all non-centrosymmetric achiral crystal lattices. We investigate the electronic structure of candidate KNL semimetal YAuGe by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillations as well as by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT has revealed that YAuGe hosts KNLs on the G-A-L-M plane of the Brillouin zone, that are protected by the time reversal and mirror-inversion symmetries. Through ARPES and quantum oscillations we identify signatures of hole bands enclosing the G point, and the observed splitting of quantum oscillation frequency with angle is attributed to spin-orbit-coupling-induced band splitting away from the KNLs. Furthermore, we show that the degeneracy of the nodal lines along the G-A line is lifted by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking when the Y is substituted by magnetic R ions (R = rare earth). This becomes a source of Berry curvature and contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in magnetic RAuGe. These findings establish RAuGe as a new class of KNL semimetals offering significant potential for engineering of anomalous magnetotransport properties via magnetic rare-earth substitution.</p>

To identify the leading-order term, we derive analytical expressions for the second-order optical response and classify the contributions by considering their transformation properties under $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry.

            <p>In the study of quantum spin liquids, the Kitaev model plays a pivotal role due to the fact that its ground state is exactly known as well as the fact that it may be realized in strongly frustrated materials such as ${\alpha}$-RuCl${}_3$. While topological insulators and superconductors can be investigated by means of topological band theory -- in particular the topological quantum chemistry (TQC) formalism -- the Kitaev model evades such a treatment, as it is not possible to set up a proper single-particle Green's function for it. We instead associate spin operators with ``orbitals'' that give rise to a band structure. It is thereby possible to analyze the corresponding excitation spectrum engendered by these localized excitations by means of TQC. Special attention is given to the low-energy topological edge mode spectrum. Our work sheds light on the question how the TQC formalism may be generalized to strongly correlated and topologically ordered systems like the Kitaev model.</p>

            <p>In magnetic systems, the microscopic constituents exhibit power law behavior near the paramagnetic transition temperature, $T_C$. The critical exponents (CEs) associated with the physical quantities that demonstrate singular behavior at $T_C$ illustrate the critical behavior, specifically the range and type of exchange interactions emerging in magnetic systems. However, it is realized that the developed methodologies may not yield accurate values of CEs, especially for magnetic systems with competing interactions, referred to as nontrivial magnetic systems. Currently, no comprehensive method effectively addresses the competing effects of the range of magnetic interactions among the constituent entities emerging in such systems. Additionally, there is no definitive explanation for CE values that do not belong to any single universality class. Here, we present new methodologies for critical analysis aimed at determining both the range of exchange interaction(s) and appropriate values of CEs. Using computational and experimental investigations, we analyze the magnetic behavior of trivial Ni and nontrivial Gd. Our findings demonstrate that (i) the critical behavior remains the same on either side of $T_C$, (ii) the critical behavior associated with local electron moments remains unaffected by the magnetic field, and (iii) in Gd, the critical role of competing interactions becomes evident: local electron moments follow a three-dimensional Ising-type short-range interaction, while itinerant electron moments exhibit a mean-field-type long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which weakens under an external magnetic field due to the localization effect on itinerant electrons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourabh Bhagwan Kadambi, Daniel Schwen, Jia-Hong Ke, Lingfeng He, Andrea M. Jokisaari</p>
            <p>Multicomponent alloys undergoing irradiation damage develop radiation-induced composition redistribution at point defect sinks such as grain boundaries (GBs) and dislocations. Such redistribution results in undesired changes to their mechanical behavior and corrosion resistance. Additively manufactured alloys proposed for future nuclear applications are expected to demonstrate a distinct response to irradiation owing to their unique microstructure with as-solidified dislocation density and chemical microsegregation. To capture the composition redistribution in such systems, we develop a mesoscale model with coupled evolution of atomic and point defect components in the presence of dislocation density, dislocation heterogeneity, and thermodynamic interactions at the GB. The model is parameterized for an FCC Fe-Cr-Ni alloy as a representative system for austenitic stainless steels, and simulations are performed in 1D and 2D as a function of irradiation temperature, dose, dislocation density, and grain size. Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) characterized by Cr depletion and Ni enrichment is predicted at both the GB and the dislocation cell wall, with RIS being lower in magnitude but wider at the cell wall. Strongly biased absorption of self-interstitials by dislocations is found to suppress Ni enrichment but slightly enhance Cr depletion under certain conditions. Thermodynamic segregation at the GB is predicted to be narrower and opposite in sign to RIS for both Cr and Ni. Importantly, non-monotonic segregation is found to occur when both thermodynamic and RIS mechanisms are considered, providing a novel physical interpretation of experimental observations. The model is expected to serve as a key tool in accelerated qualification of irradiated materials.</p>

By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that linear long-range coupling of electrons to multiple longitudinal optical phonons, described by a generalized Fröhlich mechanism, can result in superconductivity in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broad range of materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrés Santos</p>
            <p>The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.</p>

            <p>The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its Mott and antiferromagnetic behavior, as it undergoes a metal-insulator transition near a band edge. By analyzing spatial correlations of the local density of states (LDOS) using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge and determine its critical exponent as $\nu$ = 0.75 $\pm$ 0.1. We show that both the LDOS distribution functions and the multifractal spectra obey two exact symmetry relations, which are based on the Weyl group symmetry of nonlinear sigma-models. These symmetries hold across the entire transition, from extended to strongly localized states, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Overall, using tunneling spectroscopy maps on a model tin monolayer in combination with numerical models, we connect the localization patterns of disordered electronic systems with their Hamiltonian symmetry class.</p>

            <p>Photogenerated carrier transport and recombination in metal halide perovskites are critical to device performance. Despite considerable efforts, sample quality issues and measurement techniques have limited the access to their intrinsic physics. Here, by utilizing high-purity CsPbBr3 single crystals and contact-free transient grating spectroscopy, we directly monitor exciton diffusive transport from 26 to 300 K. As the temperature (T) increases, the carrier mobility ({\mu}) decreases rapidly below 100 K wtih a {\mu}~T^{-3.0} scaling, and then follows a more gradual {\mu}~T^{-1.7} trend at higher temperatures. First-principles calculations perfectly reproduce this experimental trend and reveal that optical phonon scattering governs carrier mobility shifts over the entire temperature range, with a single longitudinal optical mode dominating room-temperature transport. Time-resolved photoluminescence further identifies a substantial increase in exciton radiative lifetime with temperature, attributed to increased exciton population in momentum-dark states caused by phonon scattering. Our findings unambiguously resolve previous theory-experiment discrepancies, providing benchmarks for future optoelectronic design.</p>

Revealing the origin of second harmonic generation in nonlinear optical materials can provide theoretical guidance for the design of new materials. In this work, the origin of second harmonic generation in non-centrosymmetric materials containing lone pair electrons is revealed by analyzing the orbital interactions on the sublattice. Stereochemically inactive Pb 6\textit{s} orbitals with high symmetry in CsPbCO3F contribute less to the second harmonic generation. In contrast, the contribution of stereochemically active Pb 6s orbital in PbB5O7F3 and PbB2O3F2 is more obvious. Significantly, the orbitals of the interaction between lead and oxygen make a very significant contribution because these orbitals are located at the band edge and in non-centrosymmetric sublattices.</p>

            <p>We review the theoretical aspects of determining linear rheology using passive microrheology from simulations under periodic boundary conditions (PBC). It is common to impose periodic boundary conditions when evaluating bulk properties by molecular simulation. The Brownian motion of the probe particles is affected by PBCs, and thus their effects must be considered when microrheological analysis is applied to evaluate the dynamic modulus. First, we review the theory of microrheology based on the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in an unbounded domain. Then, we briefly discuss the effect of periodic boundary conditions on the diffusion coefficient. After that, we explain the effect of PBCs on the mean-square displacement of Brownian particles and their impact on microrheology. The passive microrheology technique under PBCs provides a new approach for rheology evaluation in molecular simulations of complex liquids in addition to the traditional Green--Kubo formula and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD).</p>

This method serves as a phenomenological extension of the established Dean-Kawasaki stochastic density functional theory, enabling the computation of shear viscosity. We apply our approach to derive general formula for the shear viscosity in single-solute solutions. Our findings yield new results and successfully reproduce previously established results for such systems as solutions containing soft-core particles, hard spheres, one-component plasma, and near-critical solutions.</p>

While defining the correlated space is straightforward for disentangled bands, the situation is more complex for entangled bands, where different projection schemes from hybridized bands to the target space can yield varying sizes of interaction parameters. We systematically evaluated different methods for calculating the polarizability functions within the correlated space. Furthermore, we analyze how different definitions of the correlated space, often constructed through Wannierization from Kohn-Sham orbitals, defines the orbital localization and play a crucial role in determining the interaction parameter. To illustrate these effects, we consider two sets of representative correlated d-orbital oxides: LiMO$_{2}$ (M = V-Ni) as examples of isolated d-electron systems and SrMO$_{3}$ (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cases of entangled d-electron systems. Through this systematic comparison, we provide a detailed analysis of different cRPA methodologies for computing the Hubbard parameters.</p>

            <p>The incorporation of dilute concentrations of bismuth (Bi) into traditional III V alloys leads to significant reduction in bandgap energy, making InSbBi is a promising candidate for long wavelength infrared photodetection sensors due to its small bandgap (<0.17 eV). Furthermore, InSbBi could serve as a valuable platform for spin dynamics and quantum phenomena due to its strong spin-orbit coupling. Despite its potential, the material quality of InSbBi alloys lags behind that of conventional III V semiconductors, primarily due to the substantial challenges associated with incorporating Bi into InSb and producing high-quality InSbBi with varying Bi compositions. In this study, we address these issues by developing a method for growing smooth InSbBi thin films with tunable Bi incorporation up to 1.81% by the dynamic adjustment of Sb flux and careful control of the interplay between growth temperature and Bi flux using molecular beam epitaxy. This work paves the path for high-quality InSbBi thin films for applications in photodetection, spintronics, and quantum technology.</p>

            <p>A generalized micromagnetic model of hopfions in a helimagnet with a two-dimensional (allowing both radial and azimuthal dependence) profile function is considered. Calculations confirm the elliptical stability of hopfions and the previously obtained analytical expression for the upper critical field of their lattice. Dependencies of the hopfion lattice periods on the magnitude of the applied external magnetic field and the uniaxial anisotropy constant of the material are obtained. It is shown that in an anisotropic helimagnet, the hopfion lattice expands in the direction of the anisotropy axis, and the expansion can be controlled by the external field and the uniaxial anisotropy constant.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yazhuang Miao, Yiming Zhao, Yong Wang, Jie Qiao, Xiaolong Zhao, Xuexi Yi</p>
            <p>We investigate a non-Hermitian extension of the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger model that incorporates spin-dependent SU(2) gauge fields, represented by non-Abelian couplings between lattice sites, as well as independent nonreciprocal hopping amplitudes. This framework gives rise to a rich phase structure characterized by complex-energy braiding and tunable non-Hermitian skin effects. By employing the generalized Brillouin zone approach, we analyze the bulk-boundary correspondence and identify topological transitions protected by chiral symmetry. Notably, we demonstrate that non-Abelian gauge fields significantly enhance the dynamical resilience of the system, enabling robust self-healing under a moving scattering potential. These results clarify the role of SU(2) gauge fields in stabilizing non-Hermitian topological phases and indicate that the proposed model can be realized with currently available photonic, atomic, and superconducting experimental platforms.</p>

            <h2>An all-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sachchidanand Das, Abhiram Soori</p>
            <p>We propose an all-electrical setup to generate valley polarization in graphene. A finite graphene sheet is connected to two normal metal electrodes each with two terminals along its zigzag edges, while the armchair edges remain free. When a bias is applied to one terminal and the others are grounded, valley polarization emerges due to transverse momentum matching between the graphene and the metal electrodes. Significant valley polarization is achieved when the Fermi wave vector in the metal exceeds half the separation between the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys in graphene. We analyze how conductance and valley polarization depend on geometric and electronic parameters. While increasing the width enhances both conductance and polarization, increasing the length introduces Fabry--Pérot oscillations and suppresses valley polarization due to enhanced intervalley mixing. We also examine the effects of disorder: on-site disorder in graphene near the Dirac point increases conductance but reduces valley polarization. Finally, we study the impact of imperfect armchair edges and interface roughness, finding that moderate deviations from ideal conditions still yield substantial valley polarization. Our results demonstrate a viable route to electrically controlling valley degrees of freedom in graphene-based devices.</p>

            <p>Coupling photonic cavity fields to electronic degrees of freedom in 2D materials introduces an additional control knob to the toolbox of solid-state engineering. Here we demonstrate a subtle competition between cavity frequency and interlayer tunneling in graphene stacks that is responsible for topological phase transitions in light-matter Hilbert space and that cannot be captured by mean-field theory in vacuum. A systematic exploration of multilayer graphene heterostructures and stacking configurations in a chiral tHz cavity reveals that linear dispersion enhances the low-energy cavity-induced topological gap. Furthermore, in bilayer graphene, a displacement field drives the low-energy vacuum band from valley-Chern to Chern insulator, comprising a gate-tunable topological phase transition. Our findings pave the way for future control and engineering of graphene heterostructures with chiral cavity fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Isaac Onyango, Byungkyun Kang, Qiang Zhu</p>
            <p>We present GPR_calculator, a package based on Python and C++ programming languages to build an on-the-fly surrogate model using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to approximate expensive electronic structure calculations. The key idea is to dynamically train a GPR model during the simulation that can accurately predict energies and forces with uncertainty quantification. When the uncertainty is high, the expensive electronic structure calculation is performed to obtain the ground truth data, which is then used to update the GPR model. To illustrate the power of GPR_calculator, we demonstrate its application in Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) simulations of surface diffusion and reactions, achieving 3-10 times acceleration compared to pure ab initio calculations.

            <p>In situ synchrotron X-ray computed tomography enables dynamic material studies, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to complex imaging artefacts and limited training data. We present a methodology for deep learning-based segmentation by transforming high-quality ex situ laboratory data to train models for binary segmentation of in situ synchrotron data, demonstrated through copper oxide dissolution studies. Using a modified SegFormer architecture, our approach achieves high segmentation performance on unseen data while reducing processing time from hours to seconds per 3D dataset. The method maintains consistent performance over significant morphological changes during experiments, despite training only on static specimens. This methodology can be readily applied to diverse materials systems, accelerating the analysis of time-resolved tomographic data across scientific disciplines.</p>

            <h2>Neuronal correlations shape the scaling behavior of memory capacity and nonlinear computational capability of recurrent neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shotaro Takasu, Toshio Aoyagi</p>
            <p>Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.</p>

            <p>Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets are a newly identified family of collinear antiferromagnets with momentum-dependent spin-split band structure of non-relativistic origin, derived from spin-group symmetry-protected crystal structures. Among candidate altermagnets, CrSb is attractive for potential applications because of a large spin-splitting near the Fermi level and a high Neel transition temperature of around 700 K. We use molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize CrSb (0001) thin films with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm. Structural characterization, using reflection high energy electron diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, demonstrates the growth of epitaxial films with good crystallinity. Polarized neutron reflectometry shows the absence of any net magnetization, consistent with antiferromagnetic order. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements probe the band structure in a previously unexplored regime of film thickness, down to 10 nm. These ARPES measurements show a three-dimensional momentum-dependent band splitting of up to 0.7 eV with g-wave symmetry, consistent with that seen in prior studies of bulk single crystals. The distinct altermagnetic band structure required for potential spin-transport applications survives down to the 10 nm thin film limit at room temperature.</p>

            <p>Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experiments, confirming that the synchronized temperature ramp-down can fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized temperature ramp-down can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we explore the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the temperature ramp-down can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution. The findings not only provide a robust method for stabilizing various superconducting magnet systems, including high-temperature superconducting magnets wound with second-generated (2G) coated tapes, but also suggest a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in other nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Bo Shi, Roderich Moessner, Ricard Alert, Marin Bukov</p>
            <p>In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</p>

            <p>Self-assemblies, structured via nanoparticles, show promise as materials for advanced applications, like photonic devices, electrochemical energy storage units and catalysis support. Despite observing diverse morphologies, a comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we show that the coordination interaction between metal sulfide nanoparticles (MS NPs) and the fluorosurfactants at the droplet interface influences the morphology during the evaporation-induced self-assembly facilitated by droplet microfluidics. Further investigation into fluorosurfactants with various chemical groups and MS NPs reveals that the strength of coordination interactions significantly influences assembly morphology. The interfacial interactions can be eliminated through coating a SiO2 layer on the metal colloid (M@SiO2 NPs). In addition, we demonstrate that the morphologies of the self-assemblies can be engineered via the coordination interactions between the MS NPs and fluorosurfactants, and by varying the concentrations of MS NPs. Utilizing these interfacial interactions, assemblies with core-shell and homogeneous distribution of binary nanoparticles were constructed. Our findings offer novel insights into the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the droplet interface through evaporation-induced self-assembly, and into the design of metal colloidal assemblies with diverse morphologies, crucial for developing novel functional assemblies for catalysis, plasmonic, and porous materials in a controlled manner.</p>

            <p>The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature TC, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to inter-band scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multi-band superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by inter-band scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying elementary crystal defects in the form of stacking faults with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune inter-band coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multi-band superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.</p>

            <p>Ongoing advances in force field and computer hardware development enable the use of molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate increasingly complex systems with the ultimate goal of reaching cellular complexity. At the same time, rational design by high-throughput (HT) simulations is another forefront of MD. In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers an enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source Vermouth python library. Vermouth is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the Vermouth library, the Martinize2 program is showcased as a generalization of the martinize script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, Martinize2 automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network (EN), and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, Martinize2 is used in two high-complexity benchmarks. The entire I-TASSER protein template database as well as a subset of 200,000 structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database are converted to CG resolution and we illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safeguard high-throughput applications.</p>

            <p>It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</p>

            <p>Bloch wavefunctions in crystals experience localization within the bulk when disorder is introduced, a phenomenon commonly known as Anderson localization. This effect is considered universal, being applicable to all types of waves, quantum or classical. However, the interaction between disorder and topology -- a concept that has profoundly transformed many branches of physics -- necessitates revisiting the original Anderson localization picture. For instance, in the recently discovered topological Anderson insulator, the introduction of disorder induces topological boundary states that can resist localization due to protection from line-gap topology. While line-gap topology applies to both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems uniquely exhibit point-gap topology, which has no Hermitian counterparts and leads to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, we experimentally demonstrate disorder-induced point-gap topology in a non-Hermitian acoustic crystal. This crystal, with non-Hermitian disorder in nearest-neighbor couplings, exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect, where all eigenstates localize at a boundary. Interestingly, the boundary where localization occurs -- either the left or right -- depends on the strength of the disorder. As the disorder strength increases, the direction of boundary localization can be reversed. Additionally, we observe a ``bipolar" skin effect, where boundary localization occurs at both the left and right boundaries when disorder is introduced in next-nearest-neighbor couplings. These findings experimentally reveal a non-Hermitian mechanism of disorder-induced localization that goes beyond the conventional framework of Anderson localization.</p>

            <p>Dynamical formation of doublons or onsite repulsively bound pairs of particles on a lattice is a highly non-trivial phenomenon. In this work, we show the signatures of doublon formation in a quantum computer by simulating the continuous time quantum walk in the framework of the one dimensional extended Fermi-Hubbard model. By considering two up-component and one down-component particles initially created at the three neighbouring sites at the middle of the lattice and allowing intra- (inter-) component nearest neighbour (onsite) interactions we show the formation a stable onsite doublon in the quantum walk. The probability of such doublon formation is more (less) if the hopping strength of the down particle is weaker (stronger) compared to the up particle. On the contrary, for an initial doublon along with a free up particle, the stability of the doublon is more prominent than the doublon dissociation in the dynamics irrespective of the hopping asymmetry between the two components. We first numerically obtain the signatures of the stable doublon formation in the dynamics and then observe them using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.</p>

            <p>Gibbs-preserving operations have been studied as one of the standard free processes in quantum thermodynamics. Although they admit a simple mathematical structure, their operational significance has been unclear due to the potential hidden cost to implement them using an operatioanlly motivated class of operations, such as thermal operations. Here, we show that this hidden cost can be infinite -- we present a family of Gibbs-preserving operations that cannot be implemented by thermal operations aided by any finite amount of quantum coherence. Our result implies that there are uncountably many Gibbs-preserving operations that require unbounded thermodynamic resources to implement, raising a question about employing Gibbs-preserving operations as available thermodynamics processes. This finding is a consequence of the general lower bounds we provide for the coherence cost of approximately implementing a certain class of Gibbs-preserving operations with a desired accuracy. We find that our lower bound is almost tight, identifying a quantity -- related to the energy change caused by the channel to implement -- as a fundamental quantifier characterizing the coherence cost for the approximate implementation of Gibbs-preserving operations.</p>

            <h2>From Single Genes to Populations: Quantifying Broken Detailed Balance in Transcription</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Holehouse</p>
            <p>Are there thermodynamic or information theoretic constraints governing mRNA expression? Here we use the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to assess detailed balance breaking in transcription. For the canonical two-state model of transcription, we derive exact analytic expressions for the entropy production rate of transcription at steady state, expressions that can be evaluated from knowledge of the kinetic parameters of the two-state model. This allows us to easily evaluate the entropy production rate of thousands of genes across seven datasets of two-state model parameters without needing to evaluate the entropy production rate from trajectory-based computation. A data-driven approach then exposes that most genes avoid parameter regimes associated with large entropy production rates, akin to a mesoscopic version of energy expenditure minimization. Importantly, we show that this is not a thermodynamic phenomenon, since the entropy production rate from the two state gene model provides only a weak bound on the housekeeping energy needed to power transcription. Finally, we show that cell-to-cell variability can make mRNA expression seem more or less irreversible than a ``representative cell'' would imply. Overall, our study presents a theoretical and data-driven approach to uncovering the potential thermodynamic and information theoretic constraints that dictate observed behaviors in transcription.</p>

            <h2>Cover times with stochastic resetting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samantha Linn, Sean D Lawley</p>
            <p>Cover times quantify the speed of exhaustive search. In this work, we compute exactly the mean cover time associated with a one-dimensional Brownian search under exponentially distributed resetting. We also approximate the moments of cover times of a wide range of stochastic search processes in $d$-dimensional continuous space and on an arbitrary discrete network under frequent stochastic resetting. These results hold for a large class of resetting time distributions and search processes including diffusion and Markov jump processes.</p>

            <h2>Global decomposition of networks into multiple cores formed by local hubs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wonhee Jeong, Unjong Yu, Sang Hoon Lee</p>
            <p>Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least connected nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. As an application of the method, we present a scheme to detect multiple core-periphery structures and the decomposition of coarse-grained supernode networks, by combining the method with the network community detection.</p>

            <h2>Pfaffian structure of the eigenvector overlap for the symplectic Ginibre ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gernot Akemann, Sung-Soo Byun, Kohei Noda</p>
            <p>We study the integrable structure and scaling limits of the conditioned eigenvector overlap of the symplectic Ginibre ensemble of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices with independent quaternion elements. The average of the overlap matrix elements constructed from left and right eigenvectors, conditioned to $x$, are derived in terms of a Pfaffian determinant. Regarded as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas with the Neumann boundary condition along the real axis, it contains a kernel of skew-orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2(1+|z-x|^2)e^{-2|z|^2}$, including a non-trivial insertion of a point charge. The mean off-diagonal overlap is related to the diagonal (self-)overlap by a transposition, in analogy to the complex Ginibre ensemble. For $x$ conditioned to the real line, extending previous results at $x=0$, we determine the skew-orthogonal polynomials and their skew-kernel with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$. This is done in two steps and involves a Christoffel perturbation of the weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, by computing first the corresponding quantities for the unperturbed weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$. Its kernel is shown to satisfy a differential equation at finite matrix size $N$. This allows us to take different large-$N$ limits, where we distinguish bulk and edge regime along the real axis. The limiting mean diagonal overlaps and corresponding eigenvalue correlation functions of the point processes with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$ are determined. We also examine the effect on the planar orthogonal polynomials when changing the variance in $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, as this appears in the eigenvector statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble.</p>

            <h2>Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</p>

            <h2>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksei Khindanov, Igor L. Aleiner, Lara Faoro, Lev B. Ioffe</p>
            <p>One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</p>

            <h2>Discrete distributions are learnable from metastable samples</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijith Jayakumar, Andrey Y. Lokhov, Sidhant Misra, Marc Vuffray</p>
            <p>Physically motivated stochastic dynamics are often used to sample from high-dimensional distributions. However such dynamics often get stuck in specific regions of their state space and mix very slowly to the desired stationary state. This causes such systems to approximately sample from a metastable distribution which is usually quite different from the desired, stationary distribution of the dynamic. We rigorously show that, in the case of multi-variable discrete distributions, the true model describing the stationary distribution can be recovered from samples produced from a metastable distribution under minimal assumptions about the system. This follows from a fundamental observation that the single-variable conditionals of metastable distributions that satisfy a strong metastability condition are on average close to those of the stationary distribution. This holds even when the metastable distribution differs considerably from the true model in terms of global metrics like Kullback-Leibler divergence or total variation distance. This property allows us to learn the true model using a conditional likelihood based estimator, even when the samples come from a metastable distribution concentrated in a small region of the state space. Explicit examples of such metastable states can be constructed from regions that effectively bottleneck the probability flow and cause poor mixing of the Markov chain. For specific cases of binary pairwise undirected graphical models (i.e. Ising models), we extend our results to further rigorously show that data coming from metastable states can be used to learn the parameters of the energy function and recover the structure of the model.</p>

            <h2>Inhomogeneous SU(2) symmetries in homogeneous integrable U(1) circuits and transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marko Znidaric</p>
            <p>Symmetries are important for understanding equilibrium as well as nonequilibrium properties like transport. In translationally invariant extended systems one might expect symmetry generators to also be homogeneous. Studying qubit circuits with nearest-neighbor U(1) gates we show that this needs not be the case. We find new inhomogeneous screw SU(2) and ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$ symmetries whose generators exhibit a spatial quasi-momentum modulation. They can be viewed as a parameter-dependent generalization of the standard rotational symmetry of the Heisenberg model and can be identified by the Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of a momentum-resolved propagator. Rich integrability structure is reflected also in transport: picking an arbitrary U(1) gate and varying the gate duration one will transition through different phases, including fractal ballistic transport, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang superdiffusion at the critical manifold that also contains helix states, diffusion, and localization. To correctly explain transport the non-local SU(2) symmetries do not matter, while the inhomogeneous local ones that almost commute with the propagator do.</p>

            <h2>Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells</h2>

            <p>Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a full qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.</p>
