            <h2>Interaction-driven quantum phase transitions between topological and crystalline orders of electrons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andr√© Haug, Ravi Kumar, Tomer Firon, Misha Yutushui, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, David F. Mross, Yuval Ronen</p>
            <p>Topological and crystalline orders of electrons both benefit from enhanced Coulomb interactions in partially filled Landau levels. In bilayer graphene (BLG), the competition between fractional quantum Hall liquids and electronic crystals can be tuned electrostatically. Applying a displacement field leads to Landau-level crossings, where the interaction potential is strongly modified due to changes in the orbital wave functions. Here, we leverage this control to investigate phase transitions between topological and crystalline orders at constant filling factors in the lowest Landau level of BLG. Using transport measurements in high-quality hBN-encapsulated devices, we study transitions as a function of displacement field near crossings of $N=0$ and $N=1$ orbitals. The enhanced Landau-level mixing near the crossing stabilizes electronic crystals at all fractional fillings, including a resistive state at $\nu = \frac{1}{3}$ and a reentrant integer quantum Hall state at $\nu = \frac{7}{3}$. On the $N=0$ side, the activation energies of the crystal and fractional quantum Hall liquid vanish smoothly and symmetrically at the transition, while the $N=1$ transitions out of the crystal appear discontinuous. Additionally, we observe quantized plateaus forming near the crystal transition at half filling of the $N=0$ levels, suggesting a paired composite fermion state stabilized by Landau level mixing.</p>

            <h2>Charge Transfer Dynamics in an Electron-Hole Bilayer Device: Capacitance Oscillations and Hysteretic Behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miranda Leigh Davis, Simon Parolo, Sandro Agostini, Christian Reichl, Werner Dietsche, Werner Wegscheider</p>
            <p>The capacitance and differential conductance of MBE-grown AlGaAs/GaAs p-i-n diodes are investigated. In these diodes, the p-doped layer, an adjacent intrinsic spacer, and a central barrier are made of AlGaAs. Capacitance oscillations and hysteretic behavior are observed and understood to be consequences of the AlGaAs spacer properties. These findings have significant implications for the design of heterostructures aimed at achieving electrically contacted, closely spaced electron and hole layers.</p>

            <h2>Classifying destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions: Towards molecular quantum rulers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Krieger, Gert-Ludwig Ingold, Fabian Pauly</p>
            <p>Destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions might be used to build molecular quantum rulers, allowing to quantify changes in external control parameters electrically. For this reason, it is important to understand which patterns of destructive quantum interference can occur inside the electronic excitation gap of a molecule, coupled to conducting electrodes. By considering a four-level model, we show that much more complex destructive quantum interference behavior can arise than expected for just two levels. We classify the destructive quantum interferences analytically and show that they may even occur in regions forbidden by the standard orbital rule for electron transport. Our results suggest that appropriate molecular design may indeed allow to construct highly sensitive molecular quantum rulers.</p>

            <h2>Higgs-mode electromagnon in the spin-spiral multiferroic CuBr${}_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bryan T. Fichera, Ajesh Kumar, Baiqing Lv, Zongqi Shen, Karna Morey, Qian Song, Batyr Ilyas, Tianchuang Luo, Riccardo Comin, T. Senthil, Nuh Gedik</p>
            <p>Below a continuous symmetry breaking phase transition, the relevant collective excitations are due to longitudinal and transverse fluctuations of the order parameter, which are referred to as Higgs and Goldstone modes, respectively. In solids, these modes may take on a different character than the equivalent excitations in particle physics due to the diverse vacuum states accessible in condensed matter. However, the Higgs mode in particular is quite difficult to observe experimentally as it decays quickly into the lower-energy Goldstone bosons and thus has a negligible lifetime in most systems. In this work, we report evidence for a novel Higgs mode in the multiferroic material CuBr${}_2$, which shows up as a coherent oscillation in the time-resolved second harmonic generation signal upon excitation with a femtosecond light pulse. Since the spiral spin order in CuBr${}_2$ induces a nonzero electric dipole moment in equilibrium, the Higgs mode--which is due to fluctuations in the amplitude of the on-site spin expectation value--is an electromagnon, and thus acquires an inversion quantum number of -1. This is in stark contrast to the Higgs boson of particle physics, which has even parity. Moreover, the excitation described here represents an entirely new type of electromagnon, distinct from the traditional electromagnon in linear spin wave theory which is due to the Goldstone mode.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Predictive and Generative Solution for Liquid Electrolyte Formulation</h2>

            <p>Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</p>

            <h2>Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Erb, Nadav Shaibe, Tsampikos Kottos, Steven M. Anlage</p>
            <p>Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) is well-known as a phenomenon where all the energy of a specific injected wavefront is completely absorbed by losses in a system, independent of details. This has applications in wavefront shaping, communication, filtering, wireless power transfer, etc. We have discovered an application of coherent perfect absorption enabling conditions as a tunable splitter that is robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at CPA enabling conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the CPA enabling conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</p>

            <h2>Micro-tip manipulated origami for robust twisted few-layer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruo-Jue Zou, Long Deng, Si-Min Xue, Feng-Fei Cai, Ling-Hui Tong, Yang Zhang, Yuan Tian, Li Zhang, Lijie Zhang, Zhihui Qin, Long-Jing Yin</p>
            <p>Twisted few-layer graphene (tFLG) has emerged as an ideal model system for investigating novel strongly correlated and topological phenomena. However, the experimental construction of tFLG with high structural stability is still challenging. Here, we introduce a highly accessible method for fabricating robust tFLG by polymer micro-tip manipulated origami. Through using a self-prepared polymer micro-tip, which is composed of multiple dimethylpolysiloxane, poly(vinyl chloride), and graphite sheets, to fold graphene layers, we fabricated tFLG with different twist angles (0¬∞-30¬∞) and various layers, including twisted bilayers (1+1), twisted double-bilayers (2+2), twisted double-trilayers (3+3), and thicker layers. Even ABC-stacked tFLG were created, such as twisted ABC/ABC and ABC/ABA graphene coexisting in an ABC-ABA domain wall region. We found that the origami-fabricated tFLG exhibits high stability against thermal and mechanical perturbations including heating and transferring, which could be attributed to its special folding and tearing structures. Moreover, based on the rich types of samples, we revealed twist-angle and stacking-order dependent Raman characteristics of tFLG, which is valuable for understanding the stacking-modulated phonon spectroscopy. Our experiments provide a simple and efficient approach to construct structurally robust tFLG, paving the way for the study of highly stable twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Planar Nernst effect from hidden band geometry in layered two-dimensional materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Biswas, Harsh Varsney, Amit Agarwal</p>
            <p>The Nernst effect is a versatile phenomenon relevant for energy harvesting, magnetic sensing, probing band topology and charge-neutral excitations. The planar Nernst effect (PNE) generates an in-plane voltage transverse to an applied temperature gradient under an in-plane magnetic field. Conventional Berry curvature-induced PNE is absent in two-dimensional (2D) systems, as the out-of-plane Berry curvature does not couple to the in-plane electron velocity. We challenge this notion by demonstrating a distinct planar Nernst effect in quasi-2D materials (2DPNE). We show that the 2DPNE originates from previously overlooked planar components of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, arising from inter-layer tunneling in multilayered 2D systems. We comprehensively analyze the band-geometric origin and crystalline symmetry constraints on 2DPNE responses. We illustrate its experimental feasibility in strained bilayer graphene. Our findings significantly expand the theoretical understanding of planar Nernst effects, providing a clear pathway for next-generation magnetic sensing and energy-harvesting applications.</p>

            <h2>Slow ferromagnetic fluctuations in the kagome metal Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ revealed by $^{27}$Al NMR</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing-Ping Ding, Charles Taylor, Yongbin Lee, Charuni Dissanayake, Vireshwar Mishra, Dang Khoa Le, Manh-Huong Phan, Yasuyuki Nakajima, Yuji Furukawa</p>
            <p>Static and dynamical magnetic and electronic properties of the kagome metal Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ have been investigated by $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The temperature dependence of Knight shift ($K$) shows a similar temperature dependence of the DC magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ except for the low-temperature region below $\sim$ 50 K where $K$ is almost constant while $\chi$ keeps increasing, which suggests that the increase in $\chi$ at low temperatures is not intrinsic. $^{27}$Al spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature ($1/T_1T$) is found to be constant, confirming the metallic state of Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ from a microscopic point of view. Based on a Korringa ratio analysis using the $T_1$ and $K$ data, ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are found to dominate in Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$. These fluctuations are suggested to be very slow with frequencies on the order of kilohertz or lower.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices based on InSb nanoflag Josephson junctions</h2>

            <p>Planar Josephson junctions (JJs) based on InSb nanoflags have recently emerged as an intriguing platform in superconducting electronics. This letter presents the fabrication and investigation of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing InSb nanoflag JJs. We provide measurements of interference patterns in both symmetric and asymmetric geometries. The interference patterns in both configurations can be modulated by a back-gate voltage, a feature well reproduced through numerical simulations. The observed behavior aligns with the skewed current-phase relations of the JJs, demonstrating significant contributions from higher harmonics. We explore the magnetic field response of the devices across a wide range of fields ($\pm 30$ mT), up to the single-junction interference regime, where a Fraunhofer-like pattern is detected. Finally, we assess the flux-to-voltage sensitivity of the SQUIDs to evaluate their performance as magnetometers. A magnetic flux noise of $S^{1/2}_\Phi = 4.4 \times 10^{-6} \Phi_0 / \sqrt{Hz}$ is identified, indicating potential applications in nanoscale magnetometry.</p>

            <h2>Electric field tunable magnetoexcitons in Xenes-hBN-TMDC, Xenes-hBN-BP, and Xenes-hBN-TMTC heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Ya. Kezerashvili, Anastasia Spiridonova, Klaus Ziegler</p>
            <p>In this work, we propose novel van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of Xenes, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), phosphorene, and transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs), which are separated by insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers. We investigate theoretically the behavior of Rydberg indirect excitons in Xenes-hBN-TMDC, Xenes-hBN-BP, and Xenes-hBN-TMTC heterostructures, subject to parallel external electric and magnetic fields that are oriented perpendicular to the layers. By incorporating both isotropic and anisotropic materials, we demonstrate that excitonic properties can be effectively tuned through the external field strengths and the heterostructure design. Our results show that the exciton reduced mass and the binding energy increase with the electric field strength, while enhanced dielectric screening from additional hBN layers reduces the binding energy. Anisotropic materials exhibit distinct excitonic responses, including variations in diamagnetic behavior. Moreover, the diamagnetic energy contributions and coefficients decrease with stronger electric fields but increase with the number of hBN layers. Finally, we explore the potential of time-periodic electric fields with Floquet band-structure engineering. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for controlling excitonic phenomena in low-dimensional materials, enabling the design of advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Few-electron spin qubits in optically active GaAs quantum dots</h2>

            <p>The knowledge of the energy spectrum completely defines the dynamics of a quantum system for a given initial state. This makes spectroscopy a key characterization technique when studying or designing qubits and complex quantum systems. In semiconductor quantum dots, the electronic quantum states can be probed through charge transport spectroscopy, but the electric current itself disrupts the fragile quantum system, and the technique is practically limited to gate-defined quantum dots. Epitaxial quantum dots benefit from excellent optical properties, but are usually incompatible with charge transport, while alternative spectroscopy techniques provide only limited information. Here we demonstrate a spectroscopy technique which utilizes nuclear spins as a non-invasive probe. By using spin currents instead of the charge currents we achieve near-equilibrium probing. Experiments are conducted on low-strain GaAs/AlGaAs epitaxial dots, revealing energy spectra for charge configurations with up to seven electrons and the subtle properties of the multi-electron states. The rich variety of observations includes long-lived spin-qubit states in s and p shells, ground-state phase transitions, strong spin-orbit coupling regimes, and anomalously fast nuclear spin diffusion. Experiments are backed up by good agreement with the first-principles configuration-interaction numerical modelling. Our work uncovers few-electron states as a new operating regime for optically active quantum dots. Accurate control and probing of many-body states offers a test-bed system for fundamental physics studies, while prospective technological applications include electron spin qubits with extended coherence and scalable electrical control.</p>

            <h2>$X$-type electrides hosting skin-like interstitial electron states and doping-enhanced superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da-Bao Zha, Peng Jiang, Yan-Ling Li, Hai-Qing Lin</p>
            <p>The exploration of electrides is of great significance for the fundamental physics due to their unique properties arising from interstitial anionic electrons. Here we report a novel class of $X$-type electrides, distinguished by two distinct anionic electron subchannels forming alternating chains in real space. Through structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify two-dimensional $M_2$N ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) materials as prototypical systems exhibiting these unique features. The anionic electron channels on the upper and lower surfaces of these materials display a vertically alternating pattern, with their projected bands revealing momentum-dependent splitting behavior in the reciprocal space, protected by a crystal symmetry operation $O$. Notably, the $X$-type electride characteristic is independent of the layer number and remains robust on the upper and lower surfaces of layered structures, presenting a pronounced skin-like effect. Additionally, we have explored the superconductivity of these systems, and found that both Ti$_2$N and Zr$_2$N are intrinsic superconductors with superconducting transition temperatures below 1.0 K. Further results show that appropriate hole doping can significantly enhance their superconducting transition temperatures and can induce the Hf$_2$N monolayer to exhibit superconductivity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and tuning of novel electrides with enhanced superconducting properties, offering a new pathway for deeply understanding the interplay between electride behavior and superconductivity in novel materials.</p>

            <h2>Control of active field theories at minimal dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artur Soriani, Elsen Tjhung, √âtienne Fodor, Tomer Markovich</p>
            <p>Advances in experimental techniques enable the precise manipulation of a large variety of active systems, which constantly dissipate energy to sustain nonequilibrium phenomena without any equilibrium equivalent. To design novel materials out of active systems, an outstanding challenge is to rationalize how material properties can be optimally controlled by applying external perturbations. However, equilibrium thermodynamics is inadequate to guide the control of such nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, there is a dire need for a novel framework to provide a systematic toolbox for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Here, we build an optimization procedure for generic active field theories within a thermodynamically consistent formulation. Central to our approach is the distinction between the protocol heat, which is dissipated only during manipulation, and the total heat, which also accounts for the post-manipulation dissipation. We demonstrate that the latter generically features a global minimum with respect to the protocol duration. We deploy our versatile approach to an active theory of phase separation, and examine the scalings of the optimal protocol duration with respect to activity and system size. Remarkably, we reveal that the landscape of steady-state dissipation regulates the crossover between optimal control strategies for a finite duration.</p>

            <h2>Synergistic Role of Transition Metals and Polyanionic Frameworks in Phosphate-Based Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhav Sharma, Riya Gulati, Rajendra S. Dhaka</p>
            <p>Ongoing research in the area of advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is expected to reduce reliance on lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), providing more affordable and sustainable energy storage solutions. Polyanionic compounds have emerged as promising options due to their stable structure and ability to withstand high-voltage conditions as well as fast charging capabilities. This review offers a thorough discussion of phosphate-based polyanionic cathodes for SIBs, exploring their structure, electrochemical performance with various transition metals, and existing challenges. We discuss different polyanionic frameworks, such as ortho-phosphates, fluoro-phosphates, pyro-phosphates, mix pyro-phosphates, and NASICON-based phosphates, highlighting their unique structural characteristics and ability to perform well across a wide potential range. Further, we delve into the mechanisms governing sodium storage and tunability of redox potentials in polyanionic materials, providing insights into the factors that affect their electrochemical performance. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential avenues for the practical applications of polyanionic high-voltage cathodes in sodium-ion battery technologies.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation-induced first-order superfluid transition in unitary $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgii Kalagov</p>
            <p>We investigate the superfluid phase transition in an $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-symmetric Fermi gas with $N$ distinct spin states using the functional renormalization group. To capture pairing phenomena beyond mean-field theory, we introduce an auxiliary bosonic field and employ the leading order of the derivative expansion of the partially bosonized effective average action. By discretizing the effective potential on a grid and numerically integrating the flow equations, we resolve the thermodynamic behavior near the transition. Our results reveal a fluctuation-induced first-order phase transition for $N \geq 4$, which is absent at the mean-field level. In the unitary regime, we provide quantitative predictions for the critical temperature, as well as for the discontinuities in the superfluid gap and entropy density as functions of $N$. With increasing $N$, the critical temperature decreases, while the discontinuities become more pronounced, indicating a stronger first-order transition.</p>

            <h2>Charge and pair density waves in a spin and valley-polarized system at a Van-Hove singularity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avigail Gil, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>We study a single component (i.e., single valley, spin-polarized) two-dimensional electron gas with $C_{3v}$ symmetry tuned to a Van-Hove (VH) singularity. Generically, there may be either three or six VH points at the Fermi level, related to each other by symmetry. Using a renormalization group analysis, we show that when the effective interactions between electrons at the VH points are positive, the system is stable. In contrast, if the effective interactions are negative, the system develops an instability toward either pair density wave (PDW) or charge density wave (CDW) orders, depending on the anisotropy of the dispersion at the VH points. The PDW may have either a single wavevector or multiple wavevectors. The PDW phase with three coexisting wavevectors can support fractional $\tfrac{h}{6e}$ vortices. The interplay between the geometry of the Fermi surface and the singularity of the density of states is the key that enables PDW formation.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in materials discovery, enabling the rapid design of novel materials with tailored properties for countless applications, including in the context of energy and sustainability. To ensure the reliability of these methods, however, rigorous validation against experimental data is essential. Scattering techniques -- using neutrons, X-rays, or electrons -- offer a direct way to probe atomic-scale structure and dynamics, making them ideal for this purpose. In this work, we describe a computational workflow that bridges machine learning-based simulations with experimental validation. The workflow combines density functional theory, machine-learned interatomic potentials, molecular dynamics, and autocorrelation function analysis to simulate experimental signatures, with a focus on inelastic neutron scattering. We demonstrate the approach on three representative systems: crystalline silicon, crystalline benzene, and hydrogenated scandium-doped BaTiO3, comparing the simulated spectra to measurements from four different neutron spectrometers. While our primary focus is inelastic neutron scattering, the workflow is readily extendable to other modalities, including diffraction and quasi-elastic scattering of neutrons, X-rays, and electrons. The good agreement between simulated and experimental results highlights the potential of this approach for guiding and interpreting experiments, while also pointing out areas for further improvement.</p>

            <h2>Time-reversal symmetry breaking in microscopic single-crystal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Remko Fermin, Matthijs Rog, Guido Stam, Daan Wielens, Joost Ridderbos, Chuan Li, Yoshi Maeno, Jan Aarts, Kaveh Lahabi</p>
            <p>Time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductivity is a quintessential unconventional quantum state. In Josephson junctions, time-reversal symmetry breaking manifests itself in the supercurrent interference pattern as the invariance of the critical current under the reversal of both transport and magnetic field directions, i.e., $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$. So far, such systems have been realized in devices where superconductivity is injected into a deliberately constructed weak link medium, usually carefully tuned by external magnetic fields and electrostatic gating. In this work, we report time-reversal symmetry breaking in spontaneously emerging Josephson junctions without intentionally constructed weak links. This is realized in ultra-pure single-crystal microstructures of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, an unconventional superconductor with a multi-component order parameter. Here, the Josephson effect emerges intrinsically at the superconducting domain wall, where the degenerate states partially overlap. In addition to violating $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$, we find a rich variety of exotic transport phenomena, including a supercurrent diode effect present in the entire interference pattern, two-channel critical current oscillations with a period that deviates from $\Phi_0$, fractional Shapiro steps, and current-switchable bistable states with highly asymmetric critical currents. Our findings provide direct evidence of TRSB in unstrained Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and reveal the potential of domain wall Josephson junctions, which can emerge in any superconductor where the pairing symmetry is described by a multi-component order parameter.</p>

            <p>An adaptive physics-informed model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy follows an iterative reconfiguration of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is proposed to guide model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. Combining the model reconfiguration and the model evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/√Ö and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.</p>

            <h2>Discrete Time Crystal in quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aarya Bothra, Arti Garg</p>
            <p>Discrete time crystals (DTC) have emerged as significant phase of matter for out-of-equilibrium many-body systems in recent years. Here, we study the role of long-range interactions and disorder in stabilizing the DTC phase. Generally, it is believed that a stable DTC phase can be realized in disordered systems with short-range interactions. We study the periodically driven quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of Ising spin-glass in which all spins are coupled to each other with random couplings. We explore the possibility of DTC phase within three different driving protocols. For all the cases, quantum SK model shows a robust DTC phase with no initial state dependence at all. We compare the periodically driven SK model with other models of long-range interactions with uniform coefficients where randomness is induced through a local field. In complete contrast to the SK model, these models show strong initial state dependence with a large number of initial states showing decay in periodic oscillations in spin-spin correlation function with time.</p>

            <h2>Melting of a Bosonic Mott Insulator in Kagome Optical Lattices with Sign-Inverted Hopping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuma Nagao, Daisuke Yamamoto, Seiji Yunoki, Ippei Danshita</p>
            <p>Using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA), we investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of ultracold bosons confined in optical kagome lattices, focusing on both unfrustrated positive and frustrated negative hopping regimes. We consider a protocol in which the system is initialized in a Mott insulating state at unit filling, and the hopping amplitude is gradually increased from zero. For positive hopping, the melting of the Mott insulator is accompanied by the emergence of a sharp peak in the momentum distribution at the $\Gamma$ point of the lowest band, signaling the onset of superfluidity. In contrast, for negative hopping, the Mott insulator melts into a highly nontrivial state without long-range phase coherence, characterized instead by a broad momentum distribution within the flat band, consistent with recent experimental observations. These results demonstrate the applicability of dTWA to highly frustrated quantum systems and offer a new route for numerically exploring the dynamics of frustrated quantum magnets.</p>

            <h2>Interplay of Conventional and Spin-Exchange Auger Recombination in Magnetically Doped Quantum Dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valerio Pinchetti, Ho Jin, Cl√©ment Livache, Victor I. Klimov</p>
            <p>Auger processes play a critical role in the behavior of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). While nonradiative Auger recombination is a key performance-limiting factor in light-emitting applications, Auger effects also present exciting opportunities for hot-carrier manipulation in emerging optoelectronic and photochemical technologies. Recent studies have shown that incorporating magnetic manganese (Mn) dopants into QDs enables an ultrafast spin-exchange (SE) mechanism that significantly accelerates Auger recombination and related processes. However, the fundamental dynamics of SE-Auger recombination, including its dependence on QD size, exciton multiplicity, and Mn-ion content, remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SE-Auger recombination in Mn-doped QDs across three regimes defined by the energetic alignment between the QD band-edge exciton and the internal Mn spin-flip transition: resonant, downhill, and uphill, corresponding to the exciton energy being approximately equal to, greater than, or smaller than the Mn spin-flip transition energy, respectively. We find that SE-Auger recombination dominates multiexciton dynamics in both resonant and downhill regimes, proceeding on ultrafast, sub-picosecond timescales, that is, significantly faster than conventional Auger decay. Notably, SE-Auger lifetimes are primarily governed by the occupancy of intrinsic excitonic states, with minimal dependence on QD size or the number of excited Mn ions. In the uphill regime, SE-Auger recombination coexists with conventional Auger processes, enabling direct comparison of their timescales alongside co-occurring hot-carrier cooling. These findings establish that SE-Auger recombination outpaces phonon-assisted cooling, making it uniquely suited for the generation and manipulation of hot carriers, and opening new avenues in advanced photoconversion and photochemistry.</p>

            <p>The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to extended string-net models or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.</p>

            <h2>Maximizing Infrared Transmission Contrast Upon Phase Transition of Thermally Grown Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films by Rapid Thermal Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Araki, Vishwa Krishna Rajan, Liping Wang</p>
            <p>Pristine vanadium dioxide (VO2), an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) material, is grown via furnace oxidation followed by rapid thermal annealing with forming gas (5%H2/95%N2) which reduces surface over-oxides such as V2O5 formed during the oxidation. The evolutional IMT behaviors of the thermochromic film and vanadium oxide states over different reduction time are systematically studied with temperature-dependent infrared spectrometry, electrical resistivity, and X-ray diffraction measurements. After optimally reducing surface over-oxides to VO2, infrared transmission contrast upon phase transition is enhanced to 46% (at 9 um wavelength) compared to 23% from fully oxidation without any reduction. Moreover, pristine VO2 thin film obtained from thermal oxidation and optimal reduction processes exhibits sharp phase transition and narrow thermal hysteresis within 2~4¬∞C in both infrared transmission and electrical resistivity, which are comparable to the VO2 of best quality prepared by other sophisticated fabrication techniques. The thermally grown method presented here would facilitate the scalable fabrication of high-quality VO2 thin films and tunable radiative coatings for high-performance thermal control applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soma Takemori, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga</p>
            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</p>

            <p>In the fusion environment, understanding the synergistic effects of transmutation-produced hydrogen (H), helium (He), and irradiation-induced displacement damage in iron-based alloys is crucial for the development of structural materials for fusion reactors. When H and He atoms are simultaneously introduced into the matrix, the interaction between irradiation-induced cavity defects (voids and bubbles) with H and He, along with their evolutionary behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, the evolutionary behavior of cavities in body-centered cubic (BCC) iron (Fe) with H and He atoms is systematically investigated through a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and statistical thermodynamics. First, an efficient and suitable set of Fe-H-He ternary potential functions for describing interatomic interactions is established. Based on the newly developed MD model, the evolutionary behavior of H/He atoms and cavities is systematically investigated under various temperature and cavity structure conditions. Specifically, the kinetic process of H/He capture by cavities is elucidated for different scenarios. Additionally, thermodynamic analyses are employed to assess the feasibility of cavity trapping of H under varying conditions. The results exhibit strong consistency with experimental results and provide significant evidence supporting the formation of the core-shell structure (where He is confined at the cavity center while H accumulates at the surface) from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. This work provides mechanistic insights into the nucleation and growth of cavities over extended temporal and spatial scales in the presence of H-He synergies.</p>

            <p>A theoretical model of the formation of an amorphous phase during the quenching of a metallic melt is proposed. It has been shown that the appearance of a significant temperature gradient during the quenching of a metallic melt leads to thermodiffusion of defects and their outflow from the melt volume, which manifests itself in a significant reduction in the number of free spaces for the diffusion transfer of the atoms of the melt. Due to the thermodiffusion process, a significant restructuring of the microstructure of the medium occurs, which leads to a significant increase in viscosity, a decrease in the diffusion coefficient and specific volume of the substance, and changes in the mechanisms of deformation. The corresponding calculations of temperature distribution, thermodiffusion and distribution of the components of the melt have been carried out.</p>

            <p>Quantum criticality, with both static and dynamic information of the system intrinsically encoded in characteristic length scales, serves as one of the most sensitive and universal probes to monitor quantum phase transition. Qualitatively different quantum criticality behaviours have been widely observed even in the same condensed matter system. The discrepancy is attributed to sample specificity but has not been systemically addressed. Here we report a single-parameter driven three-stage evolution of quantum criticality unveiled in superconductor-insulator transition in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} flakes. The evolution starts with a single quantum critical point emerging at the boundary between the superconducting and antiferromagnetic phases, then evolving into anomalous quantum Griffiths singularity at the medium doping levels and eventually being replaced by quantum Griffiths singularity in the deep superconducting regime. A puddle model that incorporates the developments of antiferromagnetic correlation can capture the evolution. The results offer a new aspect to examine previous seemingly sample-specific quantum critical behavior and lay the foundation for further exploring complex quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems; meanwhile they shed light on the detailed interaction between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in cuprates.</p>

            <h2>How rigidity percolation and bending stiffness shape colloidal gel elasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Richard, Mehdi Bouzid</p>
            <p>Dispersed colloidal particles within a suspension can aggregate and spontaneously self-organize into a robust, percolating structure known as a gel. These network-like structures are prevalent in nature and play a critical role in many industrial processes, including those involving batteries, food products, and pharmaceutical formulations. In this paper, we examine the emergence of elasticity in colloidal gels. We show that gelation is governed by a rigidity percolation transition. We identify a characteristic correlation length that quantifies the extent of elastic and structural inhomogeneities, which diverges at the critical point. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the interaction types, the particle concentration, or the specific route to non-ergodicity i.e. the preparation protocol, the elastic moduli and vibrational properties of gels can be accurately predicted within a unifying framework, in which the bending modes of fractal clusters -- approximately the size of this correlation length -- dominate under small deformations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the coherence and correlations of many-body states appearing in topological pumping in a one-dimensional Bose gas. By analyzing the system at zero and infinite interaction strengths, we reveal a rescaling of momentum distributions accompanied by a self-similar behavior in first- and second-order correlation functions. In excited states of non-interacting bosons, the momentum distribution shows a comb-like structure similar to that of non-interacting fermions but at a higher density. This is mirrored by Friedel oscillations in the one-body density matrix. At the same time, the density-density correlations still exhibit the bosonic enhancement. Our work illustrates how topological pumping induces a nontrivial mapping between bosonic and fermionic correlations.</p>

            <p>Ferroelectric altermagnets (FEAMs) offer unique magnetoelectric coupling properties by combining the characteristics of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, yet their multifunctional electric control remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce and investigate a scenario for the simultaneous electrical switching of electronic spin and magnonic chirality splitting in two-dimensional FEAMs. Based on the C2DB database, employing symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we study prototypical candidates CrPS$_3$ and V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl. We identify the mechanism: ferroelectricity arises from asymmetric displacements (P along $z$ in CrPS$_3$, V along the $xy$-direction in V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl), which inherently couples electric polarization to both electronic and magnonic degrees of freedom by retaining [C$_2$$||$M] symmetry. Our calculations explicitly demonstrate that reversing the ferroelectric polarization concurrently switches the sign of the electronic spin splitting and chirality of magnonic modes. This shows these materials as dual-switchable FEAMs, enabling unified electrical manipulation of electron and magnon properties. A potentially experimentally detectable method via the magneto-optical Kerr effect was derived. This work provides a materials-specific realization and theoretical basis for designing novel electrically controlled multifunctional spintronic, spin caloritronic, and magnonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhong, Rui Wang, Xingao Gong, Hongjun Xiang</p>
            <p>The accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects in diverse complex systems remains a significant challenge due to the high computational demands of density functional theory (DFT) and the limited transferability of existing machine-learning frameworks. This study addresses these limitations by introducing Uni-HamGNN, a universal SOC Hamiltonian graph neural network that is applicable across the periodic table. By decomposing the SOC Hamiltonian into spin-independent and SOC correction terms, our approach preserves SU(2) symmetry while significantly reducing parameter requirements. Based on this decomposition, we propose a delta-learning strategy to separately fit the two components, thereby addressing the training difficulties caused by magnitude discrepancies between them and enabling efficient training. The model achieves remarkable accuracy (mean absolute error of 0.0025 meV for the SOC-related component) and demonstrates broad applicability through high-throughput screening of the GNoME dataset for topological insulators, as well as precise predictions for 2D valleytronic materials and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures. This breakthrough eliminates the need for system-specific retraining and costly SOC-DFT calculations, paving the way for rapid discovery of quantum materials.</p>

In a cubic antiperovskite these sites form Kagome planes stacked along the <111> directions which triangular motifs induce high geometric frustration in the diluted magnetic sublattice for antiferromagnetic interactions. Despite their compelling properties as high-capacity Li-ion battery cathode materials, very little is known about the electronic and magnetic properties of lithium-rich antiperovskites. We report static magnetization, M√∂ssbauer, and NMR studies on both compounds. Our data reveal a Pauli paramagnetic-like behaviour, a long-range antiferromagnetically ordered ground state below 50 K and a regime of short-range magnetic correlations up to 100 K. Our results are consistent with a random Li-Fe distribution on the shared lattice position. In addition, Li-hopping is observed above 200 K with an activation energy of E$_a$ = 0.47 eV. Overall, our data elucidate static magnetism in a disordered magnetically frustrated and presumably semimetallic system with thermally induced ion diffusion dynamics.</p>

            <p>The superconducting proximity effect induces pairing correlations in metallic systems via Andreev scattering. This effect is particularly intriguing in graphene, as it enables two-dimensional superconductivity that is tunable through doping. Understanding how superconducting correlations propagate within the metal is crucial to unveiling the key factors behind this tunability. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the energy and length scales of the proximity effect induced by Pb islands on graphene. Using tip-induced manipulation, we assemble S/N/S junctions with tunable N-region spacing and explore the evolution of the proximitized state in the confined normal region. We find that different doping levels can lead to either localized or collective superconducting states. By combining our experimental results with quasiclassical theory, we demonstrate that interface conductance plays a key role in determining the strength and coherence length of pairing correlations and inter-island coupling. Our findings provide new insights into the design of novel superconducting states and the control of their properties.</p>

            <p>Premelting at the ice-polymer interfaces, in which a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) forms below the melting point, is strongly influenced by polymer surface chemistry; however, the molecular-scale mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. This study employs large-scale molecular dynamics simulations combined with machine learning-assisted analysis to elucidate how polymer type (hydrophilic vs hydrophobic) modulates interfacial premelting. Our simulations reveal that hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer surfaces have distinct effects on the QLL thickness, interfacial water structure, and diffusivity. Specifically, a hydrophilic polymer interface promotes a thicker QLL with more ordered interfacial water and lower diffusivity, whereas a hydrophobic interface induces a thinner QLL with a less ordered interfacial water structure and higher diffusivity. These results advance the understanding of polymer-mediated interfacial melting phenomena and offer guidance for designing anti-icing and low-friction materials.</p>

Our original expectation was the development of new nematic materials with both ferroelectric nematic (NF) and non-ferroelectric CP phases. The non-ferroelectric phase in mixtures exhibits a CP mode originally observed in pure WJ-16 and was termed as superparaelectric. However, the dielectric spectroscopy of mixtures shows two distinct relaxation processes: the typical paraelectric response and the CP mode. Therefore, this CP mode cannot be called superparaelectric and is redefined it as Hyper Dielectric mode. This is the first direct demonstration of materials with both ferroelectric and Hyper-dielectric phases in liquid crystalline materials.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Phanindra Dewan, Soumyadeep Mondal, Sumantra Sarkar</p>
            <p>Many cellular proteins, such as ERK, undergo oscillation death when cells are compressed, initiating many developmental processes in organisms. Whether such a transition arises from these proteins' specific biochemistry or generic dynamical features remains unclear. In this paper, we show that coupling mechanics to the chemistry of Hopf oscillators, such as ERK, through mechanochemical feedback (MCF) can generically drive oscillation death upon compression. We demonstrate this result using an active solid, a 1D ring of Brusselators coupled through damped springs, which we term Harmonic Brusselator Ring (HBR). Because of MCF, HBR's dynamics is non-Hermitian and breaks $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in a scale-dependent manner, generating a rich array of patterns, including traveling pulses, chimera states, intermittent fluctuations, and collective oscillation death. Furthermore, MCF engenders three dynamic phase transitions that separate the observed patterns into four phases. The underlying symmetry of HBR implies that the observed patterns and phases may generically arise in many natural and synthetic systems.</p>

In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.</p>

            <p>The intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect proposed in recent studies offers a new way to probe intrinsic band geometric properties in a large class of materials. However, the search of material platforms with a large response remains a problem. Here, we suggest that topological Weyl semimetals can host enhanced intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect. From a model study, we show that the enhancement is mainly from the orbital contribution, and the response coefficient exhibits a characteristic resonance-like lineshape around the Weyl-point energy. Using first-principles calculations, we confirm these features for the concrete material CuTlSe$_{2}$. Previous studies have reported two different topological states of CuTlSe$_{2}$. We find this difference originates from two slightly different structures with different lattice parameters. We show that the nonlinear planar Hall response is much stronger in the Weyl semimetal state than in the topological insulator state, and the large response is indeed dominated by orbital contribution amplified by Weyl points. Our work reveals a close connection between nonlinear orbital responses and topological band features, and suggests CuTlSe$_{2}$ as a suitable platform for realizing enhanced nonlinear planar Hall effect.</p>

            <p>The physics of the Kagome metal LaRh$_3$B$_2$ along with its superconductivity below 2.6 K, unlike other popular Kagome metals, is not known to be significantly influenced by the electron correlations. While the indirect techniques to probe the bulk superconducting properties of LaRh$_3$B$_2$ indicate a conventional isotropic order parameter, we show that the direct spectroscopic determination of the superconducting energy gap reveals an anomalous suppression of Andreev reflection between LaRh$_3$B$_2$ and a normal metal. This observation hints to the presence of incomplete superconducting gap formation, at least along certain momentum directions, and consequent low-lying quasiparticle states. An analysis of multiple Andreev reflection spectra captured at different points on the surface of LaRh$_3$B$_2$ reveals a distribution of the superconducting energy gap which is consistent with an anisotropic superconducting order parameter.</p>

            <h2>Exploring binary intermetallics for advanced interconnect applications using ab initio simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiroubanand Sankaran, Kristof Moors, Jean-Philippe Souli√©, Christoph Adelmann, Geoffrey Pourtois</p>
            <p>The challenge of increasing copper (Cu) resistivity with diminishing Cu interconnect dimensions in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, along with the imperative for efficient electron transport paths to fulfill scaling requirements in interconnects is significant. First-principles electronic structures calculations based on density functional theory have been performed to evaluate the potential scalability of some Cu, Al, Ru and Mo based binary alloys to replace Cu. We evaluate the expected sensitivity of the resistivity of these binary alloys to reduced line dimensions with a figure of merit that is based on generalized finite-temperature transport tensors. These transport tensors allow for a straightforward comparison between highly anisotropic intermetallics with given transport directions and Cu, and are evaluated together with their resistance to electromigration. Based on the figure-of-merit analysis, we identify several aluminides that show potential to outperform Cu at reduced interconnect dimensions in terms of their electronic transport and reliability properties.</p>

            <h2>Non-Classical Spin-Phonon Correlations Induced by Rydberg Facilitation in a Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Brady, Michael Fleischhauer</p>
            <p>We investigate the interplay between mechanical forces and the internal-state dynamics of a chain of Rydberg atoms trapped in tweezer arrays under the facilitation constraint. Dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms couple electronic (spin) degrees of freedom with excited motional (phonon) states. We show that this interaction leads to highly correlated and non-classical phonon states in the form of squeezed center of mass position states of the Rydberg atoms. Coupling with either a normal or an inverted Lennard-Jones-type potential, resulting from an avoided crossing of Rydberg potential curves, leads to in-phase or out-of-phase correlated oscillations in the atom positions respectively. Furthermore, the growth dynamics of a finite cluster of excited Rydberg atoms can be mapped to the dynamics of a single particle in a semi-infinite lattice subject to a linear potential gradient caused by spin-phonon interactions. This results in Bloch oscillations in the spin cluster size, which in turn localize spin excitations in the system.</p>

            <h2>Dimer in the Hubbard model. Exact and approximate solutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gennadiy Ivanovich Mironov</p>
            <p>Within the tight-binding model taking into account the Coulomb repulsion of electrons at one site (the Hubbard model), an exact calculation of the Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function of the C2 dimer as a structural element of fullerene, the poles of which determine the energy spectrum of the studied nanosystem, was performed. Graphic representations of the equation for the chemical potential and the density of state of electrons were obtained. A solution for the dimer was obtained within the approximation of static fluctuations. The Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function, obtained in the approximation of static fluctuations, coincided with a similar function obtained within the exact solution. The ionization energy and electron affinity were calculated and found to be 11.87 eV and 3.39 eV, respectively. It was concluded that the method for solving the Hubbard model for the C2 dimer in the approximation of static fluctuations proposed in the work can be a fairly adequate method for theoretical study of strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Non-Linear Electron Relaxation in Thin Gold Films and Their Signatures in Optical Observables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Grumm, Malte Selig, Holger Lange, Andreas Knorr</p>
            <p>Based on the momentum-resolved Boltzmann equation, we provide self-consistent numerical calculations of the dynamics of conduction electrons in thin noble metal films after linear and non-linear optical excitations with infrared and terahertz frequencies. Focusing exclusively on electron-phonon interaction, orientational relaxation is introduced and acts as dephasing of the optical excitation on a scale of tens of fs. In the linear regime, our numerical results agree with the experimental fits to a Drude model and predicts for non-linear excitations a field strength dependency of the orientational relaxation rate. In the THz regime, where the orientational relaxation proceeds faster than the oscillation cycle of the excitation THz field, a new high order dissipative Kerr-type non-linearity is predicted. This non-linearity originates from the Pauli blocking included in the electron-phonon scattering and results in a non-linearly increasing transmission of the film, detectable in experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Grumm, Andreas Knorr</p>
            <p>We investigate the momentum-resolved dynamics of conduction electrons in noble metals following ultrashort optical excitation with linearly polarized light. Using a momentum-resolved Boltzmann equation approach for electron-phonon interaction, we solve for the combined effects of orientational relaxation, thermalization, and cooling. We introduce momentum orientational relaxation as the initial step in the equilibration of an optically excited non-equilibrium electron gas by highlighting its importance for the optical response of noble metals and the dephasing of plasmonic excitations. Our numerical results for gold reveal that orientational relaxation exists independently of the absorbed optical energy and dominates on time scales on the first tens of fs after excitation. Incorporating also thermalization and cooling on times up to a few ps, our approach provides a simultaneous description of optical and thermal properties of noble metals under initial non-equilibrium conditions.</p>

            <p>This study presents a sustainable approach to synthesize bio-graphite from Pterocarpus marsupium (Indian Kino) leaves without using chemical catalysts, activating agents, or organic solvents. The resulting bio-graphite was used to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a modified Hummers method. The bio-graphite derived rGO was further incorporated with orthorhombic structured MoO$_3$ at different percentages (1, 3, and 6 wt.%) using ultrasonication. Structural, morphological, and functional characterizations were conducted using XRD, FESEM, FTIR, and UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy, revealing a bandgap of 2.82 eV for the rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ composite. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated via methylene blue degradation under natural sunlight. The rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ nanocomposite showed superior performance, achieving 90% degradation in 150 minutes when compared to 65% by pure MoO$_3$. The Scavenger tests confirmed superoxide radicals $(\cdot O_2^-)$ as the main reactive species. This work highlights the potential of bio-graphite derived rGO-MoO$_3$ nanocomposites as efficient, eco-friendly photocatalysts for wastewater treatment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. K. He, Z. Song</p>
            <p>The existence of $\eta $-pairing eigenstates in the fermionic Hubbard model is fundamentally rooted in the $\eta $-pairing symmetry, which may hold for systems with non-uniform Hubbard interaction $U$. In this work, we present a generalized Hubbard model containing a variety of pseudo-spin terms that break the SO$_{4}$ symmetry but retain the $\eta $-pairing symmetry. This allows us to construct a variety of correlated systems possessing $\eta $% -pairing eigenstates.\ We exemplify our findings by considering a modified Hubbard model associated with alternative magnetic fields and on-site repulsion. We find that the same quasi-$\eta $-pairing eigenstate exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors in the two models. Numerical results of the time evolution driven by several typical Hamiltonians accord with the analytic predictions and provide a way of the control of an $\eta $-pairing wavepacket with the aid of a time-dependent Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>We present a machine-learning guided approach to predict saturation magnetization (MS) and coercivity (HC) in Fe-rich soft magnetic alloys, particularly Fe-Si-B systems. ML models trained on experimental data reveals that increasing Si and B content reduces MS from 1.81T (DFT~2.04 T) to ~1.54 T (DFT~1.56T) in Fe-Si-B, which is attributed to decreased magnetic density and structural modifications. Experimental validation of ML predicted magnetic saturation on Fe-1Si-1B (2.09T), Fe-5Si-5B (2.01T) and Fe-10Si-10B (1.54T) alloy compositions further support our findings. These trends are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) predictions, which link increased electronic disorder and band broadening to lower MS values. Experimental validation on selected alloys confirms the predictive accuracy of the ML model, with good agreement across compositions. Beyond predictive accuracy, detailed uncertainty quantification and model interpretability including through feature importance and partial dependence analysis reveals that MS is governed by a nonlinear interplay between Fe content, early transition metal ratios, and annealing temperature, while HC is more sensitive to processing conditions such as ribbon thickness and thermal treatment windows. The ML framework was further applied to Fe-Si-B/Cr/Cu/Zr/Nb alloys in a pseudo-quaternary compositional space, which shows comparable magnetic properties to NANOMET (Fe84.8Si0.5B9.4Cu0.8 P3.5C1), FINEMET (Fe73.5Si13.5B9 Cu1Nb3), NANOPERM (Fe88Zr7B4Cu1), and HITPERM (Fe44Co44Zr7B4Cu1.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yui Matsushita, Ikki Yasuda, Fuga Watanabe, Eiji Yamamoto</p>
            <p>RNA-binding proteins form biomolecular condensates with RNA through phase separation, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes. While intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are key drivers of phase separation, additional factors such as folded domains and RNA also influence condensate formation and physical properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain elusive. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate how the multidomain structure of TDP-43, which consists of its IDR, RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), and N-terminal domain (NTD), interacts with RNA and affects the characteristics of phase separation. Our analysis reveals that interaction sites within the IDR undergo dynamic rearrangement, driven by key residues that depend on the specific combination of folded domains. Upon RNA binding, several intermolecular interactions of TDP-43 are replaced by TDP-43-polyA interactions, altering viscoelastic properties of the condensate. Specifically, RRMs enhance viscosity, whereas the NTD reduces it. The presence of polyA increases elasticity, making viscosity and elasticity comparable in magnitude. These findings suggest that the multidomain structure of TDP-43 and its RNA interactions orchestrate condensate organization, modulating their viscoelastic properties.</p>

            <p>Austenitic stainless steel (Fe$_{0.5875}$Cr$_{0.25}$Mn$_{0.09}$Ni$_{0.07}$C$_{0.0025}$) is modeled with the XTANT-3 simulation toolkit to evaluate its properties in an electronically excited state produced by ultrafast laser irradiation. The model relies on density-functional tight binding to obtain the electronic Hamiltonian, producing the electronic energy levels and wave functions. They are used to calculate the electron heat capacity, electron heat conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter at the electronic temperatures up to 25,000 K. It is revealed that stainless steel nonthermally melts at sub-picosecond timescales at the deposited dose of ~1.4 eV/atom (the electronic temperature $T_e \sim 10,000$ K): the atomic lattice disorders due to modifications of the interatomic potential induced by the excitation of electrons, even without electron-phonon coupling (Born-Oppenheimer approximation). Including the electron-phonon coupling (non-Born-Oppenheimer simulation) lowers the damage threshold dose to ~0.45 eV/atom, triggering atomic disorder at picosecond timescales via thermal melting, predicated on the atomic heating by electrons.</p>

            <p>We investigate the local crystal-field environment of cerium in the clathrate compound CeBa$_7$Au$_6$Si$_{40}$ (Ce-BAS) using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Ce-BAS is a rare example of a system where heavy-fermion physics coexists with low-energy rattling phonon modes, making it a candidate for enhanced thermoelectric performance. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a temperature-dependent local moment that cannot be explained within a static crystal-field model. A fit to the susceptibility data requires strong mixing between the j = 5/2 and j = 7/2 crystal-field states, which implies large internal splittings inconsistent with RIXS spectra. In contrast, RIXS data are well described by a model with negligible j = 5/2 - j = 7/2 mixing and an energy separation of 12 meV between the ground and first excited crystal-field states. The inability to reconcile these two datasets within a static framework points to a dynamical modification of the crystal-field potential. We attribute this to coupling between the Ce 4f electrons and low-energy phonons associated with the Ce rattling motion. This interpretation is consistent with theoretical predictions of phonon-enhanced Kondo effects and dynamical Jahn-Teller distortions. Our results highlight the need for multi-orbital impurity models that include phonon coupling to fully describe the low-energy physics of Ce-BAS.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Relaxation Dynamics in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4: Evidence of Inertial Effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. Saha, M. Singh, P. D. Babu, S. Patnaik</p>
            <p>Magnetization relaxation dynamics serve as an essential tool for uncovering the intrinsic mechanisms governing the magnetic response and energy dissipation in magnetic systems. In this work, we examine the relaxation dynamics for Beta Mn type Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4 across a frequency range of 1 kHz to 10 kHz, spanning different magnetic phases. While most magnetic systems tend to follow the Debye-like relaxation with non-zero distribution or the Cole-Cole formalism, our analysis reveal that these conventional models fail to capture frequency dependence of ac susceptibility across different magnetic phases in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4. Instead, an inertial component is needed to successfully describe the dynamics, suggesting the presence of unconventional relaxation behavior. The characteristic relaxation time is found to be of the order of 10^-5 s for both the compositions. The field dependent variation of relaxation time exhibits a non-monotonic nature, with the double peak like structure at the skyrmion phase transitions, implying slower relaxation dynamics at the phase boundaries. Furthermore, the presence of non-zero difference between isothermal and adiabatic susceptibility in the pure phases implies slower relaxation dynamics, which is consistent with the presence of finite dissipation in pure phases. The inertial term has been previously invoked to describe the dynamics in spin ice systems due to the propagation of magnetic monopoles. However, its necessity in this system, points to a wider significance in magnetization dynamics that goes beyond the conventional spin ices and skyrmions.</p>

            <p>We study the finite- and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid. In contrast, the only insulating phase that survives at high temperatures in the presence of disorder is a Bose glass. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</p>

The unique properties of fFIMs enable an electric field to drive topological superconductivity phase transitions and N√©el vector orientation to control the spatial distribution of Majorana modes, without external magnetic fields. Crucially, the absence of net magnetization in fFIM-based heterostructures preserves superconductivity, circumventing the usual trade-off between tunability and superconducting coherence in magnetized systems. Our results establish fFIM-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for tunable topological superconductivity.</p>

We characterize the junction by measurements of the magnetic field induced interference pattern, and the AC Josephson effect manifested as "Shapiro steps", examining current dependent hysteresis and junction dynamics. The latter can be tuned by temperature, gate voltage, and magnetic field. Finally, we examine the evolution of the supercurrent when subjected to in-plane magnetic fields. Notably, we observe a strong anisotropy in the supercurrent with respect to the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field. When the field is parallel to the current direction, the supercurrent is suppressed, and shows revivals with increasing magnetic field, whereas it remains almost unaffected when the field is oriented in a perpendicular direction. We suggest that this anisotropy is caused by the dependence of supercurrent interference on the junction geometry.</p>

We compute numerically dependence of spin conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ on the anisotropy $\Delta$ and the ratio $r= \Delta_2/\Delta$, in the large $\Delta$ regime. We find that, when $0<r<1$, the low-frequency conductivity assumes an anomalous form $\sigma(\omega)\approx a \omega^2 + b \Delta^{-2} $. In particular, when $\Delta\to\infty$ the model becomes dynamically constrained and most states are localized. We show, microscopically, existence of magnon bound states in the strong coupling regime, which behave as self-generated disorders for single magnons. Based on this quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytical scalings, which match well with the numerical results.</p>

            <p>Ultrasound-guided drug and gene delivery (usdg) enables controlled and spatially precise delivery of drugs and macromolecules, encapsulated in microbubbles (embs) and submicron gas vesicles (gvs), to target areas such as cancer tumors. It is a non-invasive, high precision, low toxicity process with drastically reduced drug dosage. Rheological and acoustic properties of gvs and embs critically affect the outcome of usdg and imaging. Detailed understanding and modeling of their physical properties is thus essential for ultrasound-mediated therapeutic applications. State-of-the-art continuuum models of shelled bodies cannot incorporate critical details such as varying thickness of the encapsulating shell or specific interactions between its constituents and interior or exterior solvents. Such modeling approaches also do not allow for detailed modeling of chemical surface functionalizations, which are crucial for tuning the gv-blood interactions. We develop a general particle-based modeling framework for encapsulated bodies that accurately captures elastic and rheological properties of gvs and embs. We use dissipative particle dynamics to model the solvent, the gaseous phase in the capsid, and the triangulated surfaces of immersed objects. Their elastic behavior is studied and validated through stretching and buckling simulations, eigenmode analysis, shear flow simulations, and comparison of predicted gv buckling pressure with experimental data from the literature. The presented modeling approach paves the way for large-scale simulations of encapsulated bodies, capturing their dynamics, interactions, and collective behavior.</p>

            <p>BaBiO3 has lately gained high research attention as a parent material for an interesting family of alloyed compositions with multiple technological applications. In order to grow a variety of structures, a versatile deposition tool such as molecular beam epitaxy has to be employed. In this work, molecular beam epitaxy growth of BaBiO3 on SrTiO3(001) and MgO(001) substrates is studied. When grown by molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3(001) or MgO(001) substrates, BaBiO3 is known to have two competing orientations namely, (001) and (011). Characterization of the thin film is carried out by X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, Rutherford backscattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Pathways to block the growth of BaBiO3(011) and only grow the technologically relevant BaBiO3(001) are described for both substrates. Understanding of the enabler mechanism of the co-growth is established from epitaxy point of view. This can be beneficially utilized for growth of the different compositions of BaBiO3 material family in a more controlled manner.</p>

Here, we investigate the deformation of a compressed film bonded to a half-space, where either the film or the substrate exhibits anisotropy. Within the framework of finite elasticity, we formulate nonlinear incremental equations, enabling linear and weakly nonlinear analyses. These analyses yield exact bifurcation conditions and an amplitude equation for surface wrinkling. In particular, for a simple fiber-reinforced model, we show that the bifurcation can be supercritical or subcritical depending on the ratio between the substrate and the film moduli.

            <p>In strongly correlated transition metal dichalcogenides, an intricate interplay of polaronic distortions, stacking arrangement, and electronic correlations determines the nature of the insulating state. Here, we study the response of the electronic structure to optical excitations to reveal the effect of chemical electron doping on this complex interplay. Transient changes in pristine and electron-doped 1$T$ -TaS$_2$ are measured by femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and compared to theoretical modeling based on non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory and density functional theory. The fine changes in the oscillatory signal of the charge density wave amplitude mode indicate phase-dependent modifications in the Coulomb interaction and the hopping. Furthermore, we find an enhanced fraction of monolayers in the doped system. Our work demonstrates how the combination of time-resolved spectroscopy and advanced theoretical modeling provides insights into the physics of correlated transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <h2>Graph Neural Network Prediction of Nonlinear Optical Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yomn Alkabakibi, Congwei Xie, Artem R. Oganov</p>
            <p>Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for generating lasers via second harmonic generation (SHG) are highly sought in today's technology. However, discovering novel materials with considerable SHG is challenging due to the time-consuming and costly nature of both experimental methods and first-principles calculations. In this study, we present a deep learning approach using the Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN) to predict NLO properties. Sourcing data from the Novel Opto-Electronic Materials Discovery (NOEMD) database and using the Kurtz-Perry (KP) coefficient as the key target, we developed a robust model capable of accurately estimating nonlinear optical responses. Our results demonstrate that the model achieves 82.5% accuracy at a tolerated absolute error up to 1 pm/V and relative error not exceeding 0.5. This work highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating the discovery and design of advanced optical materials with desired properties.</p>

            <p>Rapidly determining structure-property correlations in materials is an important challenge in better understanding fundamental mechanisms and greatly assists in materials design. In microscopy, imaging data provides a direct measurement of the local structure, while spectroscopic measurements provide relevant functional property information. Deep kernel active learning approaches have been utilized to rapidly map local structure to functional properties in microscopy experiments, but are computationally expensive for multi-dimensional and correlated output spaces. Here, we present an alternative lightweight curiosity algorithm which actively samples regions with unexplored structure-property relations, utilizing a deep-learning based surrogate model for error prediction. We show that the algorithm outperforms random sampling for predicting properties from structures, and provides a convenient tool for efficient mapping of structure-property relationships in materials science.</p>

            <h2>Exploring two dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant phases with time reversal symmetry and their transitions with topological operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan C. Spieler</p>
            <p>We use various topological operations to systematically study phase transitions between theories with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and time reversal symmetry in two spacetime dimensions. The phases (and accompanying CFTs) we consider come in two types - bosonic phases that are defined on unorientable manifolds and fermionic phases that are sensitive to a $\text{Pin}^-$ structure. In both cases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight connected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain the CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched criticality. In addition to showing many symmetry enriched CFTs in their natural habitats, our work discusses the fermionic analogs of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bosonic operations, which we have not seen discussed in the literature.</p>

            <p>Scaling of transistors has enabled continuous improvements in logic device performance, especially through materials engineering. However, surpassing horizontal limitations in chip manufacturing requires a vertical, third dimension. Three-dimensional integration of high-performance logic demands solving the challenge of low-temperature (less than 450¬∞C) synthesis of high-mobility n-type and p-type semiconductor thin films for back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible transistors. Metal oxides, particularly indium oxides alloyed with gallium and tungsten, are promising n-type channel materials, but suitable p-type materials for BEOL remain scarce. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a wide band-gap semiconductor, shows room-temperature p-type conductivity when doped with copper and crystallizes below 400¬∞C. Here, we report growth of crystalline ZnS thin films by pulsed laser deposition on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces including silicon nitride, thermal silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium dioxide, sapphire, platinum, and titanium nitride. X-ray diffraction reveals out-of-plane texturing across all surfaces, while grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering probes in-plane crystalline quality. Surface and interface properties are assessed using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Electrical characterization via J-V measurements (ZnS on Pt) and metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (ZnS on silicon dioxide) measurements show low leakage current ($10^{-5} A/cm^2$ at 0.40 MV/cm) and bilayer capacitor behavior, suggesting ZnS is highly intrinsic with minimal electrically active defects. Further work on doping ZnS with copper or other p-type elements is needed to realize ZnS as a dopable wide band-gap semiconductor for BEOL integration. This work demonstrates a novel thin-film growth method for sulfide semiconductors under BEOL-compatible conditions.</p>

            <h2>Towards Scalable Braiding: Topological Superconductivity Unlocked under Nearly Arbitrary Magnetic Field Directions in Planar Josephson Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richang Huang, Yongliang Hu, Xianzhang Chen, Peng Yu, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou</p>
            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZM), distinguished by their non-locality and non-Abelian statistics, are central to the pursuit of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Planar Josephson junctions (PJJ) have emerged as a promising platform, offering robust and tunable MZM. However, the perceived sensitivity of topological superconductivity to the magnetic field orientation has posed a major obstacle, particularly for scalable network architectures. Here, we uncover that topological superconductivity in PJJ fundamentally persists under nearly arbitrary in-plane magnetic field directions. The apparent collapse of the global gap under misaligned fields originates not from the destruction of superconductivity itself, but from emergent shifted bulk states from other momentum points, which obscure the gap and MZM. By introducing spatial modulations along the junction to scatter and gap out these bulk states, we restore the global topological gap and recover visible MZM. Remarkably, the spatially modulated PJJs render topological superconductivity robust against maligned fields, thereby enabling MZM survival across complex junction networks and facilitating their braiding. We propose a scalable protocol for MZM braiding and fusion with phase or gate control, opening new routes toward scalable topological quantum computing.</p>

            <p>A thermodynamic analysis of weakly nonlocal non-relativistic fluids is presented under the assumption that an additional scalar field - a so-called internal variable - also contributes to the dynamics. The most general evolution of this field and the constitutive relations for the pressure tensor and the energy current density are determined by the Liu procedure. The classical holography of perfect (i.e., non-dissipative) fluids is generally proved, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. Both Newtonian gravity and quantum fluid mechanics are covered as special cases of our fluid model. The unified framework generalises and couples quantum physics and gravitational phenomena, shedding light on the common background of several known modifications and generalisations together with thermodynamic restrictions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudipta Bera, Ayelet Vilan, Sourav Das, Israel Pecht, David Ehre, Mordechai Sheves, David Cahen</p>
            <p>While solid-state protein junctions have shown efficient electron transport over lengths that surpass those of conventional organic semiconducting systems, interfacial or contact effects may obscure the intrinsic protein charge transport properties. Therefore, contact resistance (RC) effects need to be quantified and then minimized, which poses a problem if 4-probe geometries cannot be used. Here we show how RC can be extracted quantitatively from the measured junction resistance (RP) by using the extrapolated zero-length resistance (RZLR) and short-circuit resistance (RS). We used AC (impedance spectroscopy) and DC measurements to examine charge transport in junctions of human serum albumin (HSA) and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) films with varying thicknesses. Three contact configurations, Si-Au, Au-EGaIn, and, in a micropore device (MpD), Au-Pd, were compared. While Si-Au and Au-EGaIn junctions exhibit substantial RC that we ascribe to interfacial oxides and electrostatic protein-electrode interactions, MpD effectively eliminates RC, enabling measuring the intrinsic electron transport across HSA and bR films. The exponential length dependence of RP shows a transport decay constant (beta) that varies with interfacial conditions, underscoring the role of contact engineering. By minimizing RC, exceptionally low beta values (0.7 to 1.1 per nm) are found, proving that, indeed, proteins can have outstanding charge transport efficiencies.</p>

            <p>To overcome antimalarial drug resistance, carbohydrate derivatives as selective PfHT1 inhibitor have been suggested in recent experimental work with orthosteric and allosteric dual binding pockets. Inspired by this promising therapeutic strategy, herein, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the molecular determinants of co-administration on orthosteric and allosteric inhibitors targeting PfHT1. Our binding free energy analysis capture the essential trend of inhibitor binding affinity to protein from published experimental IC50 data in three sets of distinct characteristics. In particular, we rank the contribution of key residues as binding sites which categorized into three groups based on linker length, size of tail group, and sugar moiety of inhibitors. The pivotal roles of these key residues are further validated by mutant analysis where mutated to nonpolar alanine leading to reduced affinities to different degrees. The exception was fructose derivative, which exhibited a significant enhanced affinity to mutation on orthosteric sites due to strong changed binding poses. This study may provide useful information for optimized design of precision medicine to circumvent drug-resistant Plasmodium parasites with high efficacy.</p>

Although the bipartite entanglement is restricted to nearest neighbors, we reveal the presence of long-range genuine multipartite entanglement between spatially separated spin pairs.

            <p>Nonthermal fixed points are paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium phenomena of relevance to high-energy physics, cosmology, and cold atomic gases. We propose that, despite their intrinsically nonequilibrium nature, nonthermal fixed points give rise to hydrodynamic excitations otherwise known in the vicinity of thermal equilibrium. As a result, nonthermal fixed points can also be characterized by transport coefficients, such as a far-from-equilibrium, and therefore manifestly time-dependent, incarnation of shear viscosity. We corroborate our proposal with explicit studies using relativistic kinetic theory with binary collisions of massless particles in the 14-moment approximation and comparisons to QCD kinetic theory simulations.</p>

We leveraged the capabilities of LLMs, specifically gpt-4o-mini, as core agents to integrate various MOF-related agents, including synthesis, attribute, and chemical information agents. This integration culminated in the development of MOFh6, an LLM tool designed to streamline the MOF synthesis process. MOFh6 allows users to query in multiple formats, such as submitting scientific literature, or inquiring about specific MOF codes or structural properties. The tool analyzes these queries to provide optimal synthesis conditions and generates model files for density functional theory pre modeling.

            <h2>Simulation of a rapid qubit readout dependent on the transmission of a single fluxon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Waltraut Wustmann, Kevin D. Osborn</p>
            <p>The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\leq 0.1\%$.</p>

We present Sparks, a multi-modal multi-agent AI model that executes the entire discovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and iterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without human intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously unknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond ~80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and (ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly robust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a "frustration zone" of high variance in mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed reasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy structure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired generation-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility.

            <p>Floquet code is a dynamical quantum memory with a periodically evolving logical space. As a defining feature, the code exhibits an anyon automorphism after each period, giving rise to a non-trivial evolution of each logical state. In this paper, we study the Floquet code under local decoherence and demonstrate that below the decoherence threshold, the code is in a robust phase characterized by the anyon automorphism. We first derive the 3D statistical mechanics model for the maximum likelihood decoder of the 2D Floquet code under local Pauli decoherence. We identify a class of two-qubit Pauli channels under which the 3D statistical mechanics model becomes decoupled 2D models and obtain the threshold for such decoherence channels. We then propose a diagnostic of the anyon automorphism in the presence of local decoherence. We analytically show that this diagnostic distinguishes the Floquet code from the toric code under repeated syndrome measurements and undergoes a phase transition at the threshold.</p>

Specifically, we relate the transition amplitudes in the Rabi Model to a sum over $n$ binary variables of the form of a partition function of an Ising model with $n$ spin sites, where $n$ is also the number of steps in Trotter's formula. From this, we show that a perturbative expansion in the energy splitting of the two-level subsystem in the Rabi model is equivalent to an expansion in the number of spin domains in the Ising model. We conclude by discussing how calculations in one model give nontrivial information about the other model, and vice-versa, as well as applications and generalizations this correspondence may find.</p>

            <p>As transistor sizes reach the mesoscopic scale, the limitations of traditional methods in ensuring thermodynamic consistency have made power dissipation optimization in transistor amplifiers a critical challenge. Based on stochastic thermodynamics, a transistor voltage amplifier model is first proposed as a new insight to investigate nonlinear relationships between the power dissipation and voltage gain for complementary symmetric voltage amplifier circuits (CSVACs). Utilizing the proposed model, the phenomenon, i.e., the power dissipation exponentially increases with the increase of voltage gain in CSVACs, is first clarified by an analytical expression to quantify the impact of voltage gain and input signal amplitude on the power dissipation. Considering the characteristic of power dissipation, a new multistage architecture is proposed to reduce the power dissipation in CSVACs. To optimize the power dissipation by adjusting the number of stages and the voltage gain at each stage, an optimal multistage scheme is proposed for multistage CSVACs. Simulation and experimental results show up to 99.36% and 94.59% power dissipation reduction compared with traditional CSVACs by the proposed optimal multistage scheme, respectively.</p>

We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by M.~Atiyah and R.~Bott long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s.</p>

            <p>Given a finite lifetime, a ubiquitous challenge in quantum systems is how to prepare a target state in the shortest possible time. This issue is particularly relevant for Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers where the dephasing time is typically restricted to a few microseconds. In this work, we develop a rapid passage to ordered many-body states in a Rydberg atomic chain, which allows the transition of the system to various ordered phases in the phase diagram, such as the Z$_2$-, Z$_3$-, and Z$_4$-ordered antiferromagnetic states. Our scheme ramps the parameter in a "non-adiabatic to quasi-adiabatic to non-adiabatic (NQN)" manner. The NQN configuration significantly reduces the time cost required for the state preparation using entirely adiabatic methods, and is generally appliable to sizable number of atoms. Moreover, we experimentally validate the NQN scheme on the neutral-atom quantum cloud computer Aquila.</p>

            <p>The rapid spread of information and rumors through social media platforms, especially in group settings, motivates the need for more sophisticated models of rumor propagation. Traditional pairwise models do not account for group interactions, a limitation that we address by proposing a higher-order rumor model based on hypergraphs. Our model incorporates a group-based annihilation mechanism, where a spreader becomes a stifler when the fraction of hyperedges aware of the rumor exceeds a threshold. Our model has two distinct subcritical behaviors: exponential and power-law decay, which can coexist depending on the heterogeneity of the hypergraph. Interestingly, our analysis reveals continuous phase transitions in both homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs, challenging the idea that higher-order interactions lead to discontinuous transitions. Finally, we validate our model using empirical data from Telegram and email cascades, providing additional evidence that real-world rumor propagation tends to occur near criticality. These results open the door to a more detailed understanding of rumor dynamics in higher-order systems.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Imaginary Time Crystals in the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Slootman, L. Eek, C. Morais Smith, R. Arouca</p>
            <p>Parity-time symmetry constrains the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems to be either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. The transition between a symmetry-preserving phase with real energies and a symmetry-broken phase with complex energies is marked by exceptional points, one of the hallmarks of non-Hermitian systems. Because of these properties, these systems are widely studied, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the gain and loss Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for both bosons and fermions, and establish the existence of an imaginary time crystal phase, an imaginary time analogue of a time crystal. This phase occurs when there is a resonance condition between the Matsubara frequencies and the spectrum of the system, making the Green's function of the system oscillate in imaginary time with the Matsubara frequency. We show that this phase appears in the symmetry-broken region. In particular, the topological edge states of this system exhibit oscillations that are present for bosons. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our results for experiments. We examine signatures of these phases in terms of correlation functions in real time and oscillations in thermodynamic potential in inverse temperature $\beta$, and explore possible experimental platforms to realize this system.</p>

            <h2>Classical simulation of parity-preserving quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolin Wille, Sergii Strelchuk</p>
            <p>We present a classical simulation method for fermionic quantum systems which, without loss of generality, can be represented by parity-preserving circuits made of two-qubit gates in a brick-wall structure. We map such circuits to a fermionic tensor network and introduce a novel decomposition of non-Matchgate gates into a Gaussian fermionic tensor and a residual quartic term, inspired by interacting fermionic systems. The quartic term is independent of the specific gate, which allows us to precompute intermediate results independently of the exact circuit structure and leads to significant speedups when compared to other methods. Our decomposition suggests a natural perturbative expansion which can be turned into an algorithm to compute measurement outcomes and observables to finite accuracy when truncating at some order of the expansion. For particle number conserving gates, our decomposition features a unique truncation cutoff reducing the computational effort for high precision calculations. Our algorithm significantly lowers resource requirements for simulating parity-preserving circuits while retaining high accuracy, making it suitable for simulations of interacting systems in quantum chemistry and material science. Lastly, we discuss how our algorithm compares to other classical simulation methods for fermionic quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Second-Order Compatible-Strain Mixed Finite Elements for 2D Compressible Nonlinear Elasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Jahanshahi, Damiano Pasini, Arash Yavari</p>
            <p>In recent years, a new class of mixed finite elements -- compatible-strain mixed finite elements (CSMFEs) -- has emerged that uses the differential complex of nonlinear elasticity. Their excellent performance in benchmark problems, such as numerical stability for modeling large deformations in near-incompressible solids, makes them a promising choice for solving engineering problems. Explicit forms exist for various shape functions of first-order CSMFEs. In contrast, existing second-order CSMFEs evaluate shape functions using numerical integration. In this paper, we formulate second-order CSMFEs with explicit shape functions for the displacement gradient and stress tensor. Concepts of vector calculus that stem from exterior calculus are presented and used to provide efficient forms for shape functions in the natural coordinate system. Covariant and contravariant Piola transformations are then applied to transform the shape functions to the physical space. Mid-nodes and pseudo-nodes are used to enforce the continuity constraints for the displacement gradient and stress tensor over the boundaries of elements. The formulation of the proposed second-order CSMFEs and technical aspects regarding their implementation are discussed in detail. Several benchmark problems are solved to compare the performance of CSMFEs with first-order CSMFEs and other second-order elements that rely on numerical integration. It is shown that the proposed CSMFEs are numerically stable for modeling near-incompressible solids in the finite strain regime.</p>

            <p>We exhibit an uncountable family of extremal inhomogeneous Gibbs measures of the low temperature Ising model on regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These states arise as low temperature perturbations of local ground states having a sparse enough set of frustrated edges, the sparseness being measured in terms of the isoperimetric constant of the graph. This result is implied by an extension of the article [9] on regular trees to non-amenable graphs. We argue how we can deduce the extremality of an uncountable subset of the Series-Sinai states [30] at low temperature.</p>

            <p>Large atomic models (LAMs) have undergone remarkable progress recently, emerging as universal or fundamental representations of the potential energy surface defined by the first-principles calculations of atomic systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these models achieve true universality, as well as their comparative performance across different models, remains limited. This gap is largely due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks capable of evaluating the effectiveness of LAMs as approximations to the universal potential energy surface. In this study, we introduce LAMBench, a benchmarking system designed to evaluate LAMs in terms of their generalizability, adaptability, and applicability. These attributes are crucial for deploying LAMs as ready-to-use tools across a diverse array of scientific discovery contexts. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art LAMs released prior to April 1, 2025, using LAMBench. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the current LAMs and the ideal universal potential energy surface. They also highlight the need for incorporating cross-domain training data, supporting multi-fidelity modeling, and ensuring the models' conservativeness and differentiability. As a dynamic and extensible platform, LAMBench is intended to continuously evolve, thereby facilitating the development of robust and generalizable LAMs capable of significantly advancing scientific research.

            <p>Coupling molecular transition dipole moments to surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) results in the formation of new optical quasiparticles, i.e., plexcitons. Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light modes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular processes ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we investigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules aggregated in the crystalline {\alpha}-phase and an SPP on a plain gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of mixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our recently developed higher-order pump-probe spectroscopy to separate the system's fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle interactions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate is a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in the system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is surprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of the plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast transition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states that do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how hybrid exciton-plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization of the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.</p>

            <p>We investigate the generation of non-stabilizerness, or magic, in a multi-particle quantum walk by analyzing the time evolution of the stabilizer R√©nyi entropy $M_2$. Our study considers both single- and two-particle quantum walks in the framework of the XXZ Heisenberg model with varying interaction strengths. We demonstrate that the spread of magic follows the light-cone structure dictated by the system's dynamics, with distinct behaviors emerging in the easy-plane ($\Delta < 1$) and easy-axis ($\Delta > 1$) regimes. For $\Delta < 1$, magic generation is primarily governed by single-particle dynamics, while for $\Delta > 1$, doublon propagation dominates, resulting in a significantly slower growth of $M_2$. Furthermore, the magic exhibits logarithmic growth in time for both one and two-particle dynamics. Additionally, by examining the Pauli spectrum, we show that the statistical distribution of level spacings exhibits Poissonian behavior, independent of interaction strength or particle number. Our results shed light on the role of interactions on magic generation in a many-body system.</p>

            <p>Olivine comprises approximately 70 $\%$ by volume of the Earth's upper mantle, making it likely that it controls the mechanical, electrical and seismic properties of the upper mantle. All rocks are composed of crystals separated by grain boundaries, which affect their overall conductivity, strength and viscosity. Here, we present a study of forsterite (Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$) polycrystals synthesised between 1150 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C to obtain samples with different grain sizes. The grain boundary plane distributions (GBPD) were analysed by SEM and EBSD. A reversible change in the GBPD is observed between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. The GBPD shows that the most commonly occurring grain boundary planes are {0kl}-type at 1290 $^{\circ}$C and below, while at 1390 $^{\circ}$C, (010) grain boundary planes dominate the average crystal habitus. The least common planes at all temperatures are (100). This reversible transition in the dominant grain boundary plane type is evidence for a temperature-dependent complexion transition occurring between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. It is well established that different grain boundary crystallographies are related to different grain boundary properties. We relate the observed grain boundary complexion transition to differences in grain boundary properties observed in previous studies and suggest their influence on bulk rock properties.</p>

            <p>The minimal training set to train a working CNN is explored in detail. The considered model is the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the square lattice. Here $J_1 < 0$ and $J_2 > 0$ are the nearest and next-to-nearest neighboring couplings, respectively. We train the CNN using the configurations of $g \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} J_2/|J_1| = 0.7$ and employ the resulting CNN to study the phase transition of $g = 0.8$. We find that this transfer learning is successful. In particular, only configurations of two temperatures, one is below and one is above the critical temperature $T_c$ of $g=0.7$, are needed to reach accurately determination of the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$. However, it may be subtle to use this strategy for the training. Specifically, for the considered model, due to the inefficiency of the single spin flip algorithm used in sampling the configurations at the low-temperature region, the two temperatures associated with the training set should not be too far away from the $T_c$ of $g=0.7$, otherwise, the performance of the obtained CNN is not of high quality, hence cannot determine the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$ accurately. For the considered model, we also uncover the condition for training a successful CNN when only configurations of two temperatures are considered as the training set.</p>

            <p>Thin-wall metal ultramicro- and nanoelectrodes (UMEs/NEs), especially gold NEs, are indispensable for high-resolution electrochemical microscopy, biosensing, and fundamental research. However, their damage susceptibility and the lack of scalable fabrication methods hinder broader adoption. We present a versatile wet-chemical approach for high-throughput fabrication of thin-wall Au NEs/UMEs and multifunctional NEs with ~80% reproducibility. This method is based on a unique template-assisted 1D growth of single-crystalline Au in borosilicate nanopipettes followed by electrochemical contacting with tungsten microwires, and focused ion beam milling, ensuring precise control over NEs dimensions. Adaptable to various metals and integrable in multifunctional probes, the method facilitates batch production of high-quality NEs with standardized electrical connections. Structural and electrochemical characterization reveals a twinned single-crystalline Au core, a seamless Au/glass interface, and highly stable electrochemical performance. Notably, smaller electrodes exhibit higher current densities, enhancing chemical detection sensitivity. Specifically, we demonstrate outstanding spatial (< 200 nm) and current (< 1 pA) resolutions, low limit of detection (~11.0 {\mu}M) and high stability (7 h) in scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (photo-SECM), by detecting photo-oxidation reaction on atomically smooth Au micro-flakes. We also demonstrate growth in double-barrel pipettes for SECM/SICM probes as well as Pt NEs. Overall, this scalable method addresses longstanding challenges in NEs, paving the way for advanced electrochemical and spectro-electrochemical microscopy, including SERS/TERS integration. With single-crystalline surfaces, these electrodes open new frontiers in catalysis, interfacial electrochemistry, biosensing, and molecular-scale investigations.</p>

            <p>We develop a diffuse solid method that is versatile and accurate for modeling wetting and multiphase flows in highly complex geometries. In this scheme, we harness N + 1-component phase field models to investigate interface shapes and flow dynamics of N fluid components, and we optimize how to constrain the evolution of the component employed as the solid phase to conform to any pre-defined geometry. Implementations for phase field energy minimization and lattice Boltzmann method are presented. Our approach does not need special treatment for the fluid-solid wetting boundary condition, which makes it simple to implement. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we employ the diffuse solid method to explore wide-ranging examples, including droplet contact angle on a flat surface, particle adsorption on a fluid-fluid interface, critical pressure on micropillars and on Salvinia leaf structures, capillary rise against gravity, Lucas-Washburn's law for capillary filling, and droplet motion on a sinusoidally undulated surface. Our proposed approach can be beneficial to computationally study multiphase fluid interactions with textured solid surfaces that are ubiquitous in nature and engineering applications.</p>

            <h2>Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liam L.H. Lau, Piers Coleman</p>
            <p>Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir√© AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir√© K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</p>

            <p>Spintronics has become a broad and important research field that intersects with magnetism, nano-electronics, and materials science. Its overarching aim is to provide a fundamental understanding of spin-dependent phenomena in solid-state systems that can enable a new generation of spin-based logic devices. Over the past decade, graphene and related 2D van der Waals crystals have taken center stage in expanding the scope and potential of spintronic materials. Their distinctive electronic properties and atomically thin nature have opened new opportunities to probe and manipulate internal electronic degrees of freedom. Purely electrical control over conduction-electron spins can be attained in graphene-transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, due to proximity effects combined with graphene's high electronic mobility. Specifically, graphene experiences a proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling that enables efficient spin-charge interconversion processes; the two most well-known and at the forefront of current research are the spin Hall and inverse spin galvanic effects, wherein an electrical current yields a spin current and non-equilibrium spin polarization, respectively. This article provides an overview of the basic principles, theory, and experimental methods underpinning the nascent field of 2D material-based spintronics.</p>

The deep sub-wavelength confinement of the nano-antennas means that the ultra-strong coupling regime can be reached even with a small number of carriers compared to Fabry-Perot cavities, making it viable to be used with a variety of 2D materials. The non-degenerate circularly polarized ground state was only obtained after carefully optimizing the optical design to minimize the parasitic coupling to linearly polarized light.</p>

            <p>AuSn$_{4}$ is the example of an compound that exhibits topological properties. Recent XRD measurements reveal an ambiguous nature of the crystal structure, as it can be realized with either Aea2 or Ccca symmetry. Motivated by this, we analyze the dynamical stability of the compound. We discuss the role of van der Waals (vdW) corrections within the ab initio calculation. Interestingly, our main result indicates that AuSn$_{4}$ can be unstable with both Aea2 and Ccca symmetries, due to the soft modes in the phonon spectra. From the soft mode analyses we find dynamically stable Pc structure. This structure has always smaller energy than Aea2 or Ccca crystal and it stays independent of the vdW correction. We also show that the comparison of theoretical electronic properties with the experimental ARPES measurements. Our findings may be valuable in the future investigations of AuSn$_{4}$-like compounds.</p>

            <p>The disorder-induced quantum phase transition between superfluid and non-superfluid states of bosonic particles in one dimension is generally expected to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. Here, we show that hard-core lattice bosons with integrable power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ - corresponding in spin language to a $XY$ model with power-law couplings - undergo a non-BKT continuous phase transition instead. We use exact quantum Monte-Carlo methods to determine the phase diagram for different values of the exponent $\alpha$, focusing on the regime $\alpha > 2$. We find that the scaling of the superfluid stiffness with the system size is scale-invariant at the transition point for any $\alpha\leq 3$ - a behavior incompatible with the BKT scenario and typical of continuous phase transitions in higher dimension. By scaling analysis near the transition point, we find that our data are consistent with a correlation length exponent satisfying the Harris bound $\nu \geq 2$ and demonstrate a new universal behavior of disordered bosons in one dimension. For $\alpha>3$ our data are consistent with a BKT scenario where the liquid is pinned by infinitesimal disorder.</p>

            <p>The full spectrum and integrability of unitary equivalent models are the same. A standard diagnostic tool of integrability is level spacing statistics which requires separating the full spectrum into sectors according to the symmetry. When two unitary equivalent models have different symmetries, it is interesting to know how their level spacing statistics show consistent conclusions. In this work, we examine the level spacing statistics of two unitary equivalent models with distinct local symmetries. The first model is spin-1 XXZ chain $H$, the second model is obtained by Kennedy-Tasaki transformation $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$. We find that the level spacings of model $H$ follow the statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). However, model $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$ only displays GOE statistics in some sectors after a "hidden non-local symmetry" is resolved, and the other sectors labeled by quantum numbers corresponding to the local symmetries exhibit non-GOE statistics. Additionally, a mapping relation between the levels in the sector $\{Z,X,I\}$ of model $H$ and the sector $\{Z,X,I'\}$ of model $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$ is found, where $Z,X,I$ correspond to the quantum numbers of $\pi$ rotation around $z,x$ axes and bond-centered inversion.</p>

In this work we provide a set of neccessary and sufficient conditions for a non-equilibrium steady state model to be expressible by superstatistics, showing that $\beta_F$ by itself determines the existence of a superstatistical distribution of temperature.</p>

            <p>This paper presents the outcome of a study focused on the evolution of internal damage in fresh cement mortar over 25 hours of hardening. In situ timelapse X-ray computed micro-tomography ({\mu}XCT) imaging method was used to detect internal damage and capture its evolution in cement mortar hardening. During {\mu}XCT scans, the temperature released during the cement hydration was measured, which provided insight into the internal damage evolution with a link to a hydration temperature rise. The measured temperature during cement mortar hardening was compared with an analytical model, which showed a relatively good agreement with the experimental data. Using 20 CT scans acquired throughout the observed cement mortar hardening, it was possible to obtain a quantified characterisation of the porous space. Additionally, the use of timelapse {\mu}XCT imaging over 25 hours allowed for studying the crack growth inside the meso-structure including its volume and surface characterisation. The results provide valuable insights into cement mortar shrinkage and serve as a proof-of-concept methodology for future material characterisation.</p>

Performing the group theory analysis of the mentioned soft mode, we found that the stable structure has the Immm symmetry and can be achieved by shifts of Ge atoms. Additionally, we show that the final structure realizes a distorted honeycomb Ge lattice as well as a non-flat kagome-like Fe net. For completeness, we present the electronic properties calculations. From the theoretical STM topography simulation, we indicate that the observed CDW occurs in the deformed honeycomb Ge sublattice.</p>

            <h2>Closely piling up of multiple adhesive fronts in adhesive friction due to re-attachment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Puyu Cao, Meicheng Yao, Bin Chen</p>
            <p>As a fundamental force, friction exerts a profound influence on various aspects of our daily lives across multiple disciplines. To understand why adhesive friction is associated with the contact area, here we investigate the generic sliding of elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface by considering re-attachment/healing. We then reveal multiple adhesive fronts closely aligning along the interface with the number of these regions generally increasing with the contact area. These adhesive fronts exhibit rich dynamics and their accumulation along an interface can aid each other through re-attachment/healing in friction, apparently resulting in the increase in the calculated shear-off force with the contact area. Based on these findings, we propose a generalized law of adhesive friction. Our analysis further suggests that accumulating adhesive fronts possibly to a critical area density along the interface can trigger crack-like propagation of individual fronts at high velocities, which potentially bridges the gap between tribology and fracture mechanics. We discuss the relevance of this work to earthquake mechanics, which might provide a unified framework that captures key aspects of fault behavior. We expect that this work can provide a fundamental understanding of healing-mediated interfacial phenomena in diverse systems spanning biology, geology, and engineering.</p>

            <h2>Defect design in ferroelectrics -- new insights on agglomeration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Han Teng, Anna Gr√ºnebohm</p>
            <p>Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we furthermore show that a pinched double-loop field hysteresis allows for large recoverable stored energy which can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Polar-Core Spin Vortices in Inhomogeneous Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary L. Stevens-Hough, Matthew J. Davis, Lewis A. Williamson</p>
            <p>In the easy-plane phase, a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is magnetized in a plane transverse to the applied Zeeman field. This phase supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs), which consist of phase windings of transverse magnetization. Here we show that spin-changing collisions cause a PCV to accelerate down density gradients in an inhomogeneous condensate. The dynamics is well-described by a simplified model adapted from scalar systems, which predicts the dependence of the dynamics on trap tightness and quadratic Zeeman energy. In a harmonic trap, a PCV accelerates radially to the condensate boundary, in stark contrast to the azimuthal motion of vortices in a scalar condensate. In a trap that has a local potential maximum at the centre, the PCV exhibits oscillations around the trap centre, which persist for a remarkably long time. The oscillations coincide with the emission and reabsorption of axial spin waves, which reflect off the condensate boundary.</p>

            <p>We present theoretical and experimental results exploring a half-Heusler compound TmPdSb with unusual band order and metallic surface states. Typically, the half-Heusler systems exhibit topological features in a semimetallic state, and trivial ones in an insulating state. Topological properties of the most of half-Heusler systems are related to the band inversion around the Fermi level, similar to this observed in CdTe/HgTe systems. In the case of TmPdSb we observed the gapped electronic band structure with ``band inversion'' in the conductance band, while the slab-like system realized metallic surface states. The bulk insulating nature of the compound was corroborated by means of electrical transport measurements. The experimental data revealed several features due to the presence of metallic surface states, such as linear magnetoresistance and weak-antilocalization effect, characterized by enhanced coherence length and a very large number of surface conductive channels. Our findings reveal new features of the rare-earth half-Heusler.</p>

            <h2>Universal Planckian relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Shekhter, B. J. Ramshaw, M. K. Chan, N. Harrison</p>
            <p>A major puzzle in understanding high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity is the microscopic origin of the linear-in-temperature ($T$-linear) resistivity in the strange metal state, which persists up to very high temperatures. Implicit to existing theoretical discussions of this universal `{Planckian}' relaxation rate is the assumption that it must also be independent of doping, $p$. Applied to the cuprates, however, this apparently contradicts the observed strong doping-dependence ($\propto 1/p$) of the slope of the $T$-linear resistivity over a wide doping range. Here, we show through a combination of measurements, including optical conductivity and entropy, that the plasma frequency squared $\omega_p^2$ scales as $p$ over a similar doping range. Together, these dependences provide compelling evidence that the relaxation rate $1/\tau$ is indeed doping-independent (i.e. universal) throughout the entire strange metal state. Furthermore, we argue that the entire doping dependence of $\omega_p^2$ can be understood to arise from an effective mass enhancement of a specific form proposed by Anderson [\emph{Science} \textbf{235}, 1196 (1987)] in the context of doped Mott insulators. Such a mass enhancement originates from strong short-range repulsive interactions, while the Planckian relaxation rate itself appears to be an emergent phenomenon of independent physical origin.</p>

            <p>In a recent paper [T. Shang et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 224504 (2023)], the authors study the physical properties of TaReSi compounds having Ima2 structure.

However, for a correct description of topological features, it is important to recognize the correct structure of the compound at low temperature. In this Comment, we show that Ima2 cannot be realized by TaReSi and is unstable at low temperature. The Ima2 structure contains the soft modes at S (1/2,0,0) point, which leads to the stable structure with Cm symmetry. Notably, the stable Cm system also has a noncentrosymmetric structure, which can be the actual source of topological properties.</p>

            <h2>Algorithmic detection of crystal structures from computer simulation data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumitava Kundu, Kaustav Chakraborty, Avisek Das</p>
            <p>Detection of crystal structures from particle positions of crystalline assemblies formed in computer simulations is an unsolved problem. The standard protocol, formulated in the reciprocal space, for structure determination from experimental diffraction data is not suitable for analysis of computer simulation data, after converting them to the Fourier space. There is a long history of attempts to tackle this problem by analyzing the system in the real space by using ideas of local neighbors and broken symmetries of the crystalline state. In this paper, we propose a heuristic solution to this problem by detecting all possible unit cells directly from particle coordinates obtained in a typical computer simulation. The method is based on well known facts about crystal structures, some of which are underutilized in the context of the current problem. These include, the symmetry of the coordination polyhedron and its empirical relationship with directions of lattice vectors for a simple Bravais lattice, and the fact that any complex crystal can be systematically decomposed into multiple Bravais lattices. By using these ideas, along with standard computational techniques like search, clustering and convex hull construction, we were able to handle complex basis and construct all crystallographically viable unit cells from the coordinates. The method is capable of handling statistical noise by employing certain cutoffs and deals with multicomponent systems in a transparent manner. We validated it on real Monte Carlo simulation data and variety of test systems, including crystals with tens of particles in the basis. Our heuristic algorithm, which requires minimal human intervention and computational resources, provides a solution to the long standing problem and would be beneficial to the wider communities of condensed matter physics and computational materials science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Zou, Hai Zeng, Zhuo Wang, Guohao Dong, Xiaodong Guo, Fangjun Lu, Zengwei Zhu, Youguo Shi, Yifeng Yang, Yongkang Luo</p>
            <p>The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</p>

            <p>We first study the importance of the sign of the Berry curvature in the Euler characteristic of the two-dimensional topological material with two bands. Then we report an observation of a character of the topological transition as a percolation of the sign of the Berry curvature. The Berry curvature F has peaks at the Dirac points, enabling us to divide the Brillouin zone into two regions depending on the sign of the F: one with the same sign with a peak and the other with the opposite sign. We observed that when the Chern number is non-zero, the oppositely signed regions are localized. In contrast, in the case of a trivial topology, the oppositely signed regions are delocalized dominantly. Therefore, the oppositely signed region will percolate under the topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial. We checked this for several models including the Haldane model, the extended Haldane model, and the QWZ model. Our observation may serve as a novel feature of the topological phase transition.</p>

            <p>A heavy-fermion paramagnet UTe$_2$ has been a strong candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p>

            <p>Nucleic acids such as mRNA have emerged as a promising therapeutic modality with the capability of addressing a wide range of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for nucleic acids were used in the COVID-19 vaccines and have received much attention. While modern manufacturing processes which involve rapidly mixing an organic stream containing the lipids with an aqueous stream containing the nucleic acids are conceptually straightforward, detailed understanding of LNP formation and structure is still limited and scale-up can be challenging. Mathematical and computational methods are a promising avenue for deepening scientific understanding of the LNP formation process and facilitating improved process development and control. This article describes strategies for the mechanistic modeling of LNP formation, starting with strategies to estimate and predict important physicochemical properties of the various species such as diffusivities and solubilities. Subsequently, a framework is outlined for constructing mechanistic models of reactor- and particle-scale processes. Insights gained from the various models are mapped back to product quality attributes and process insights. Lastly, the use of the models to guide development of advanced process control and optimization strategies is discussed.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Valley Degeneracy on Thermoelectric Properties of Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons with Staggered Sublattice Potentials and Transverse Electric Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David M T Kuo</p>
            <p>This study investigates the band inversion of flat bands in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using a tight-binding model. The band inversion results from symmetry breaking in the transverse direction, achievable through deposition on specific substrates such as separated silicon carbide or hexagonal boron nitride sheets. Upon band inversion, ZGNRs exhibit electronic structures characterized by valley degeneracy and band gap properties, which can be modulated by transverse electric fields. To explore the impact of this level degeneracy on thermoelectric properties, we employ Green's function techniques to calculate thermoelectric quantities in ZGNR segments with staggered sublattice potentials and transverse electric fields. Two carrier transport scenarios are considered: the chemical potential is positioned above and below the highest occupied molecular orbital. We analyze thermionic-assisted transport (TAT) and direct ballistic transport (DBT). Level degeneracy enhances the electric power factors of ZGNRs by increasing electrical conductance, while the Seebeck coefficient remains robust in the TAT scenario. Conversely, in DBT, the enhancement of the power factor primarily stems from improvements in the Seebeck coefficient at elevated temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Role of anisotropic confining potential and elliptical driving in dynamics of a Ge hole qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bashab Dey, John Schliemann</p>
            <p>The squeezing of a Ge planar quantum dot enhances the Rabi frequency of electric dipole spin resonance by several orders of magnitude due to a strong Direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction in such geometries (Bosco et al 2021 Phys. Rev. B 104 115425). We investigate the geometric effect of an elliptical (squeezed) confinement and its interplay with the polarization of driving field in determining the Rabi frequency of a heavy-hole qubit in a planar Ge quantum dot. To calculate the Rabi frequency, we consider only the p-linear SOIs viz. electron-like Rashba, hole-like Rashba and hole-like Dresselhaus which are claimed to be the dominant ones by recent studies on planar Ge heterostructures. We derive approximate analytical expressions of the Rabi frequency using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for small SOI and driving strengths. Firstly, for an out-of-plane magnetic field with magnitude B, we get an operating region with respect to B, squeezing and polarization parameters where the qubit can be operated to obtain 'clean' Rabi flips. On and close to the boundaries of the region, the higher orbital levels strongly interfere with the two-level qubit subspace and destroy the Rabi oscillations, thereby putting a limitation on squeezing of the confinement. The Rabi frequency shows different behaviour for electron-like and hole-like Rashba SOIs. It vanishes for right (left) circular polarization in presence of purely electron-like (hole-like) Rashba SOI in a circular confinement. For both in- and out-of-plane magnetic fields, higher Rabi frequencies are achieved for squeezed configurations when the ellipses of polarization and the confinement equipotential have their major axes aligned but with different eccentricities. We also deduce a simple formula to calculate the effective heavy hole mass by measuring the Rabi frequencies using this setup.</p>

            <h2>On interactive anisotropic walks in two dimensions generated from a three state opinion dynamics model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surajit Saha, Parongama Sen</p>
            <p>A system of interacting walkers is considered in a two-dimensional hypothetical space, where the dynamics of each walker are governed by the opinion states of the agents of a fully connected three-state opinion dynamics model. Such walks, studied in different models of statistical physics, are usually considered in one-dimensional virtual spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along the Y-axis while it can move either way along the X-axis. The walk shows that there are three distinct regions as the noise parameter, responsible for driving a continuous phase transition in the model, is varied. In absence of any noise, the scaling properties and the form of the distribution along either axis do not follow any conventional form. For any finite noise below the critical point the bivariate distribution of the displacements is found to be a modified biased Gaussian function while above it, only the marginal distribution along one direction is Gaussian. The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well as in the exponents.</p>

            <h2>Analytical expression for $œÄ$-ton vertex contributions to the optical conductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juraj Krsnik, Anna Kauch, Karsten Held</p>
            <p>Vertex corrections from the transversal particle-hole channel, so-called $\pi$-tons, are generic in models for strongly correlated electron systems and can lead to a displaced Drude peak (DDP). Here, we derive the analytical expression for these $\pi$-tons, and how they affect the optical conductivity as a function of correlation length $\xi$, fermion lifetime $\tau$, temperature $T$, and coupling strength to spin or charge fluctuations $g$. In particular, for $T\rightarrow T_c$, the critical temperature for antiferromagnetic or charge ordering, the dc vertex correction is algebraic $\sigma_{VERT}^{dc}\propto \xi \sim (T-T_c)^{-\nu}$ in one dimension and logarithmic $\sigma_{VERT}^{dc}\propto \ln\xi \sim \nu \ln (T-T_c)$ in two dimensions. Here, $\nu$ is the critical exponent for the correlation length. If we have the exponential scaling $\xi \sim e^{1/T}$ of an ideal two-dimensional system, the DDP becomes more pronounced with increasing $T$ but fades away at low temperatures where only a broadening of the Drude peak remains, as it is observed experimentally, with the dc resistivity exhibiting a linear $T$ dependence at low temperatures. Further, we find the maximum of the DPP to be given by the inverse lifetime: $\omega_{DDP} \sim 1/\tau$. These characteristic dependencies can guide experiments to evidence $\pi$-tons in actual materials.</p>

            <p>Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is typically considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME). The relation between these two phenomena has the status of a hypothesis and is based on sequence of assumptions. We rely on the Keldysh technique of non-equilibrium theory. It allows us to investigate the accumulation of axial charge -- the process that involves both chiral anomaly and relaxation followed by the energy dissipation. We consider the case of strong magnetic field and calculate directly both axial charge density and electric conductivity taking into account both scattering on impurities and interaction with phonons. We obtain the same dependence of axial charge density on electric and magnetic fields, and the same dependence of electric current on axial charge density as the standard heuristic CME calculation. This confirms (in the limit of strong magnetic fields) the hypothesis that the origin of magnetoconductivity in Dirac semimetals is the CME.</p>

            <p>Gapped fracton phases constitute a new class of quantum states of matter which connects to topological orders but does not fit easily into existing paradigms. They host unconventional features such as sub-extensive and robust ground state degeneracies as well as sensitivity to lattice geometry. We investigate the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model [1] which can describe a family of fracton phases defined on arbitrary graphs. Focusing on representative geometries where the 3D lattices are extensions of 2D square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices into the third dimension, we study their ground state degeneracies and mobility of excitations, and examine their entanglement renormalization group (ERG) flows. All models show bifurcating behaviors under ERG but have distinct ERG flows sensitive to both $N$ and lattice geometry. In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices are equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast to previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice is robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.</p>

It can be applied at or out of equilibrium, with any diagrammatic formalism, such as real times, imaginary times, or Matsubara frequencies formalisms. As a proof of principle, we illustrate our method with the half-filled Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice in the DMFT approximation, using Quantum Quasi-Monte Carlo (QQMC) to obtain the impurity perturbation series on the real time axis.</p>

            <p>`Strange' metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ($T$) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and Umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions such as large-$N$ limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a non-perturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals' key experimental signature of linear-in-$T$ resistivity with a universal `planckian' transport scattering rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{tr} \sim k_B T/\hbar$ that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point, and instead arises from a phase of matter with gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: a feature that is also observed in several experiments. These gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations take the form of spatially localized overdamped modes, whose presence could possibly be detected using recently developed nanoscale magnetometry methods. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated electron materials.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiminori Hattori, Kenyu Chikamori, Hayato Iizuka, Ata Yamaguchi</p>
            <p>The Rice-Mele model consists of a one-dimensional lattice with two sublattice sites in each unit cell subjected to a staggered sublattice potential. The onsite potential constitutes a mass term that breaks chiral symmetry. In this paper, we show that a topological phase transition is induced in this model by disordering intracell and intercell hopping energies unequally, by means of a symmetry-independent global invariant. For small enough mass, the phase transition is accompanied by anomalous localization, which is accounted for in terms of geometric means of random variables. The specific disorder strength at which anomalous localization occurs is independent of mass. In contrast, the critical disorder strength at which the phase transition takes place decreases as mass increases, and eventually becomes invariable for large enough mass. For large enough mass, we show that the phase transition is characterized by arithmetic means instead of geometric means.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamics of particle-hole symmetric systems: a quantum Monte Carlo study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrien Reingruber, Kitinan Pongsangangan, Fakher Assaad, Maksim Ulybyshev</p>
            <p>The emergence of hydrodynamic behavior in electronic flow within clean, particle-hole-symmetric systems at half-filling is a non-trivial problem. Navier-Stokes (NS) equations describe the momentum flow, while experimental measurements typically capture the current flow profiles. However, in particle-hole-symmetric systems, electric current and momentum flow are entirely decoupled because electrons and holes move in opposite directions with equal distribution functions. This makes it challenging to link NS equations to observed flow patterns. In this work, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic behavior of the charge current at half filling can emerge despite the absence of momentum flow. By combining Boltzmann transport theory with numerically exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of clean graphene samples, we show that NS-type equations can be derived directly for the charge current, eliminating the need for any additional mechanism coupling the velocity field and charge current in explaining the experimentally observed hydrodynamic flow profiles in graphene at half-filling. We show that a new transport quantity - the current diffusion coefficient - replaces viscosity and expect this description to be valid for any particle-hole symmetric system. Our results provide new insights into the interpretation of experimental data and demonstrate how Quantum Monte Carlo calculations can serve as an alternative to experiments in transport measurements to verify the kinetic theory results.</p>

            <h2>Atomistic insights into Cu segregation effects on irradiation-induced defect dynamics in medium-entropy alloys</h2>

            <p>Copper (Cu) segregation in medium and high-entropy alloys (M/HEAs) has shown significant influence on alloy properties. In this study, we investigate the effect of Cu segregation on evolution of irradiation-induced defects in FeNiCu, a model MEA, using hybrid molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Thermodynamically driven hybrid MC/MD annealing at low temperature resulted in a partially decomposed Cu-segregated structure (CSS) and was compared with a random solid solution (RSS) and pure Ni. Results through cumulative displacement cascades reveal that Cu-rich domains in CSS act as defect traps, accelerating interstitial-vacancy recombination and suppressing defect cluster growth. The complex potential energy landscape (PEL) in CSS disrupts dislocation propagation, leading to spatially dispersed networks. Notably, CSS exhibits reduced stair-rod dislocation density compared to RSS, highlighting its superior resistance to irradiation swelling. Localized shear strain causes dislocations to preferentially nucleate in/near Cu-rich regions though their growth is hindered by chemical heterogeneity of the alloy. Notably, prolonged irradiation induces slow Cu segregation in the RSS structure, while slowly annihilating pre-existing Cu clusters in CSS simultaneously. The findings provide atomic-scale insights into the interplay between Cu segregation and irradiation-induced defect evolution in MEAs.</p>

            <h2>Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison against quantum and classical Ising machines</h2>

            <p>Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.</p>

            <h2>Geometric bound on structure factor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yugo Onishi, Alexander Avdoshkin, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>We show that a quadratic form of quantum geometric tensor in $k$-space sets a bound on the $q^4$ term in the static structure factor $S(q)$ at small $\vec{q}$. Bands that saturate this bound satisfy a condition similar to Laplace's equation, leading us to refer to them as $\textit{harmonic bands}$. We provide examples of harmonic bands in one- and two-dimensional systems, including (higher) Landau levels. The geometric bound further leads to a topological bound on the $q^4$ term, which is saturated only when the band geometry satisfies the trace condition and, additionally, the quantum geometric tensor is uniform in $k$-space. We speculate that these bounds taken together provide a useful guide for identifying Chern bands that favor (Abelian or non-Abelian) fractional Chern insulators.</p>

            <h2>Refining the Two-Band Model for Highly Compensated Semimetals Using Thermoelectric Coefficients</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Leahy, Andrew Treglia, Gang Cao, Brian Skinner, Minhyea Lee</p>
            <p>In studying compensated semimetals, the two-band model has proven extremely useful in capturing electrical conductivity under magnetic field, as a function of density and mobility of electron-like and hole-like carriers. However, it rarely offers practical insight into magneto-thermoelectric properties. Here, we report the field dependence of thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in a highly compensated semimetal NbSb$_2$, where we find the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients increase quadratically and linearly with applied magnetic field, respectively. Such field dependence was predicted in previous work that studied a system of two parabolic bands, within semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory when the following two conditions are simultaneously met:$\omega_c\tau \gg 1$ and $\tan\theta_H \ll 1$. Under these conditions, we find the field dependence of the TE coefficients directly provides a relation between the electron-like ($n_e$) and hole-like ($n_h$) carrier densities, which in turn can be used to refine two-band model fitting. With this, we find the compensation factor ($\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}$) of NbSb$_2$ is two orders of magnitude smaller than what was found in unrestricted fitting, resulting in a larger saturation field scale for magnetoresistance. Within the same framework of the semiclassical theory, we also deduce that the thermoelectric Hall angle $\tan\theta_{\gamma} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ can be expressed as $\big(\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e} \times \omega_c\tau\big)^{-1}$, which serves as a parameter to predict the degree of compensation. Our findings offer crucial insights into identifying empirical conditions for field-induced enhancement of TE performance and into engineering efficient thermoelectric devices based on semimetallic materials.</p>

            <p>Changes in the wavefunction's phase during propagation in a random Hermitian lattice, a process known as dephasing, results in diffusion rather than Anderson localization. However, when non-Hermiticity is introduced, the wave behavior changes drastically. In particular, we demonstrate that in weakly disordered non-Hermitian lattices, dephasing enhances eigenmode localization which results in abrupt jumps between spatially distant regions. These jumps, which are absent under purely coherent conditions, emerge from the interplay between complex disorder and dephasing.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic thermal Hall effect of optical phonons enhanced by discrete rotational symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuesong Hu, Junren Shi</p>
            <p>We investigate the intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity contributed by optical phonons in a cubic system. The discrete rotational symmetry of the system splits the degeneracy of transverse modes across most regions of wave-vector space, except along a few high-symmetry lines. Consequently, in the presence of an external magnetic field, phonon Berry curvatures become sharply peaked near these high-symmetry lines. We find that the singular distribution of the Berry curvature induces an intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity that is significantly enhanced compared to an isotropic system. It exhibits a nonlinear $B\ln B$ dependence on the magnetic field $B$ and a non-monotonic temperature dependence. At elevated temperatures, it reverses sign and approaches a non-vanishing value asymptotically. Our analysis indicates that the behavior results from competition between contributions from Berry curvatures near different high-symmetry lines.</p>

            <h2>Soft symmetries of topological orders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli</p>
            <p>(2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</p>

            <h2>Optical absorption and luminescence of $Œ±$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Garcia, Walter R. L. Lambrecht</p>
            <p>$\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe Salpeter Equation (BSE). The half-filling of the narrow split-off band leads to a spin-splitting and formation of magnetic moments of 0.5 $\mu_B$ per V which order antiferromagnetically along the chain or $b$-direction. The imaginary part of the dielectric function shows a very strong optical absorption band near 2 eV for polarization along the $a$-direction. This absorptions stems from a localized transition between the occupied V-$d_{xy}$ derived band, which is odd with respect to the $a$-mirrorplane to the higher lying empty band formed from the same V-$d_{xy}$ orbitals but even with respect to that mirror-plane, which explains its polarization and large oscillator strength. We relate this to a recent experimental study of cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a suppression of the lowest CL peak was observed upon addition of Li. The lowest CL peak near 1.8 eV, which lies well below the indirect absorption onset of V$_2$O$_5$ is proposed to be related to recombination of a self-trapped electron polaron, resulting from oxygen vacancies, with a hole at the valence band maximum and is suppressed in LiV$_2$O$_5$ by the strong self--absorption from the Li induced occupied band to the higher empty bands at about the same energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolaos Kolezakis, Stefano Aime, Raffaele Pastore, Vincenzo Guida, Gaetano D Avino, Paolo Edera</p>
            <p>We investigate the rheology, microscopic structure, and dynamics of an industrially relevant dispersion made of cationic surfactant vesicles, from dilute to concentrated conditions. We find that these suspensions exhibit a shear-thinning behavior at relatively low concentrations. At the microscale, this corresponds to a well-defined transition in both the structure, marked by the appearance of a peak in the static structure factor, and the dynamics, which slow down and develop a two-step decay in the correlation functions. This low-concentration transition is particularly surprising in light of experiments showing that for surfactant vesicles of similar composition the interactions should be purely repulsive. This leads us to propose that the observed structural and dynamic transition could arise, as an entropic effect, from the large sample polydispersity coupled to crowding. The shear-thinning behavior is thus interpreted as the nonlinear response of this transient structure to the imposed flow. Our work suggests that similar effects might be a generic feature of dense, highly polydisperse charged suspensions.</p>

We show that the non-equilibrium synchronization of sizes systematically leads to a homogeneous configuration associated with the survival of a single species. Remarkably, the relaxation towards such a configuration features a transient phase separation. By delineating and analyzing the dominant kinetic factors at play during relaxation, we recapitulate the phase diagram of species survival in terms of the parameters of the size landscape. Finally, we obtain a hydrodynamic mapping to equilibrium by coarse-graining the microscopic dynamics, which leads to predicting the nature of the transitions between various regimes where distinct species survive.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayana Ezoe, Makoto Katori, Tomoyuki Shirai</p>
            <p>Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-mass for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of real data-analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</p>

            <p>Membrane proteins are crucial in regulating biomembrane shapes and controlling the dynamic changes in membrane morphology during essential cellular processes. These proteins can localize to regions with their preferred curvatures (curvature sensing) and induce localized membrane curvature. Thus, this review describes the recent theoretical development in membrane remodeling performed by membrane proteins. The mean-field theories of protein binding and the resulting membrane deformations are reviewed. The effects of hydrophobic insertions on the area-difference elasticity energy and that of intrinsically disordered protein domains on the membrane bending energy are discussed. For the crescent-shaped proteins, such as Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs superfamily proteins, anisotropic protein bending energy and orientation-dependent excluded volume significantly contribute to curvature sensing and generation. Moreover, simulation studies of membrane deformations caused by protein binding are reviewed, including domain formation, budding, and tubulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoyo Hinuma</p>
            <p>Atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) are crystallographic information that describe the statistical distribution of atoms around an atom site. Anisotropic ADPs by atom were directly derived from classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a universal machine-learned potential. The (co)valences of atom positions were taken over recordings at different time steps in a single MD simulation. The procedure was demonstrated on extended solids, namely rocksalt structure MgO and three thermoelectric materials, Ag8SnSe6, Na2In2Sn4, and BaCu1.14In0.86P2. Unlike the very frequently used lattice dynamics approach, the MD approach can obtain ADPs in crystals with substitutional disorder and explicitly at finite temperature, but not under conditions where atoms migrate in the crystal. The calculated ADP becomes ->0 at temperature ->0 and the ADP is proportional to the temperature when the atom is in a harmonic potential and the sole contribution to the actual non-zero ADP is from the zero-point motion. The zero-point motion contribution can be estimated from the proportionality constant assuming this Einstein model. ADPs from MD simulations would act as a tool complementing experimental efforts to understand the crystal structure including the distribution of atoms around atom sites.</p>

When the coupling to the bath satisfies detailed balance, we obtain a condition for parametric instabilities to be suppressed, symmetrically for both chiralities. Remarkably, by designing a purely chiral coupling to the bath, instead of instability suppression, we uncover a driven-dissipative phase transition between the former symmetric parametric instability and a new chiral parametric instability. In the latter, a single chirality of bosonic quasiparticles gets exponentially amplified, leading to a dynamical chiral imbalance within the TLL, reminiscent of the non-Hermitian skin effect.</p>

            <p>Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Sahay, Curt von Keyserlingk, Ruben Verresen, Carolyn Zhang</p>
            <p>It is well known that an exponentially localized Hamiltonian must be gapless if its ground state has algebraic correlations. We show that even certain exponentially decaying correlations can imply gaplessness. This is exemplified by the deformed toric code $\propto \exp(\beta \sum_{\ell} Z_{\ell}) |\mathsf{TC}\rangle$, where $|\mathsf{TC}\rangle$ is a fixed-point toric code wavefunction. Although it has a confined regime for $\beta > \beta_c$, recent work has drawn attention to its perimeter law loop correlations. Here, we show that these unusual loop correlations -- namely, perimeter law coexisting with a 1-form symmetry whose disorder operator has long-range order -- imply that any local parent Hamiltonian must either be gapless or have a degeneracy scaling with system size. Moreover, we construct a variational low-energy state for arbitrary local frustration-free Hamiltonians, upper bounding the finite-size gap by $O(1/L^3)$ on periodic boundary conditions. Strikingly, these variational states look like loop waves -- non-quasiparticle analogs of spin waves -- generated from the ground state by non-local loop operators. Our findings have implications for identifying the subset of Hilbert space to which gapped ground states belong, and the techniques have wide applicability. For instance, a corollary of our first result is that Glauber dynamics for the ordered phase of the two-dimensional classical Ising model on the torus must have a gapless Markov transition matrix, with our second result bounding its gap.</p>

For 1.6 {\mu}m- and 2.2 {\mu}m-long InSb TSNWs we demonstrate the existence of the optimum design space defined by the applied magnetic field and electrochemical potential, which leads to clear ZBCP signatures with a Majorana localization length down to ~340 nm.</p>

            <p>Active nematic flows in two dimensions, largely driven by motile $+1/2$ disclinations, mix themselves efficiently and exhibit chaos in the bulk steady state. Motivated by recent experimental findings for three-defect braiding in cardioid-shaped domains, we investigate how this tendency toward chaotic fluid mixing can, counterintuitively, produce certain ordered, periodic flows in confinement with a controllable net topological charge. We study two-dimensional active nematics in systems with boundary conditions requiring a prescribed number of excess $+1/2$ disclinations, using Beris-Edwards nematohydrodynamics simulations, alongside an agent-based, hydrodynamic simulation approach. We find ordered flows for systems of three and four defects, and we use tools from braid theory to show that spontaneously occurring periodic defect motions produce maximal topological entropy. Our theory correctly predicts the generic absence of stable periodic orbits of more than four defects in strong confinement in simulation. Our results identify the parameter regime outside of which periodicity is lost, and allow us to probe the limits of topological entropy production.</p>

            <p>The interactions between conduction electrons and magnetism can significantly enhance the Hall signal, a phenomenon known as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). While the AHE is generally not expected in antiferromagnets, a large AHE is observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin textures and nonvanishing Berry curvature. In this work, we present a rich temperature and magnetic phase diagram with eight distinct magnetic phases for the antiferromagnetic kagome compound LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$. The Hall effect analysis in LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$ reveals both intriguing physical phenomena and methodological challenges. In the coplanar canted antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an AHE, which likely originates from the intrinsic effects. At low temperatures, upon entering the ferromagnetic phase, the AHE sharply increases and exceeds the conventional limits expected from intrinsic mechanisms. We also demonstrate the limitations of standard experimental methods in extracting the topological contribution to the Hall effect data. We show the importance of considering magnetoresistance anisotropy when estimating the anomalous and topological Hall effects. These shortcomings in current approaches in partitioning the Hall response necessitate new tools to interpret transport results in complex magnetic materials such as LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$.</p>

We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Over the past two decades, 2D materials have rapidly evolved into a diverse and expanding family of material platforms. Many members of this materials class have demonstrated their potential to deliver transformative impact on fundamental research and technological applications across different fields. In this roadmap, we provide an overview of the key aspects of 2D material research and development, spanning synthesis, properties and commercial applications. We specifically present roadmaps for high impact 2D materials, including graphene and its derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes as well as their heterostructures and moir√© systems. The discussions are organized into thematic sections covering emerging research areas (e.g., twisted electronics, moir√© nano-optoelectronics, polaritronics, quantum photonics, and neuromorphic computing), breakthrough applications in key technologies (e.g., 2D transistors, energy storage, electrocatalysis, filtration and separation, thermal management, flexible electronics, sensing, electromagnetic interference shielding, and composites) and other important topics (computational discovery of novel materials, commercialization and standardization). This roadmap focuses on the current research landscape, future challenges and scientific and technological advances required to address, with the intent to provide useful references for promoting the development of 2D materials.</p>

            <p>The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. We extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we find an evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by the dynamical quantum phase transition.</p>

            <p>High entropy perovskite oxides (HEPOs) have emerged as a promising family of stable electrode materials for high-temperature water splitting. The concentration of oxygen vacancies in HEPOs significantly influences critical properties, such as the ionic conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient. However, predicting oxygen vacancy concentrations for the design of HEPOs with high-entropic A-sites remains challenging due to the complex arrangements of metal cations. Our experimental findings reveal that variations in A-site cation size constitute a crucial factor in affecting the oxygen vacancy concentration. High-throughput atomistic simulations using a machine-learned universal interatomic potential reveal that the lattice distortions from A-site size variations result in a broadened distribution of oxygen vacancy formation energies. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in statistical thermodynamics, provides formulations for the enthalpy and entropy of oxygen vacancy formation as functions of variance in oxygen bonding energy. Altogether, our results show mixing metal cations of varying sizes in the A-site creates statistical effects on the oxygen vacancy thermodynamics, resulting in a unique approach to tuning their concentrations for complex perovskite oxides.</p>

The discovery of intrinsic materials where such properties appear together represents a frontier in modern condensed matter physics. Trigonal PtBi$_2$ has recently emerged as a possible candidate, being the first example of superconducting type-I Weyl semimetal. However, several aspects of this promising compound still need to be unveiled, concerning its complicated band structure, the actual role of Weyl points in determining its electronic properties and the nature of the superconducting transition. In this work, we experimentally investigated a t-PtBi$_2$ single crystal by means of the Hall and Nernst effects. In particular, we revealed a change of regime in its electronic properties, which is compatible with a temperature and magnetic field evolution of hole-like pockets in the Fermi Surface.</p>

            <p>Scalar-fermion models, such as the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, admit natural $1d$ defects given by the exponential of a scalar field integrated along a straight line. In $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions the defect coupling is weakly relevant and the setup defines a non-trivial interacting defect CFT. In this work we study correlation functions on these defect CFTs to order $\varepsilon$. We focus on $1d$ correlators constrained to the line, which include canonical operators like the displacement and the one-dimensional analog of the spin field. These results give access to perturbative CFT data that can be used as input in the numerical bootstrap. We also consider local operators outside the line, in particular two-point functions of scalars whose dynamics are non-trivial due to the presence of the defect.</p>

            <p>Consider the elliptic operator given by \[ \mathscr{L}_\epsilon f=b\cdot\nabla f+\epsilon\Delta f \] for some smooth vector field $b:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\epsilon>0$, and the initial-valued problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$ \[ \left\{\begin{aligned}&\partial_t u_\epsilon=\mathscr{L}_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &u_\epsilon(0,\,\cdot)=u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. \] for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Under the hypothesis that the diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$ has a Gibbs invariant measure of the form $\exp \{-U(x)/\epsilon\}dx$ for some smooth Morse potential function $U$, we provide the complete characterization of the multi-scale behavior of the solution $u_\epsilon$ in the regime $\epsilon\to0$. More precisely, we find the critical time scales $1\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(1)}\ll\cdots\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(q)}$ as $\epsilon\to0$, and the kernels $R_t^{(p)}:M_0\times M_0\to\mathbb{R}_+$, where $M_0$ denotes the set of local minima of $U$, such that \[ \lim_{\epsilon\to0}u_\epsilon(t\theta_\epsilon^{(p)},\,x)=\sum_{m'\in M_0}R_t^{(p)}(m,\,m')u_0(m'), \] for all $t>0$ and $x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the dynamical system $\dot{x}(t)=b(x(t))$. We then complete the characterization of the solution $u_\epsilon$ by computing the exact asymptotic limit of the solution between time scales $\theta_\epsilon^{(p)}$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(p+1)}$ for each $p$, where $\theta_\epsilon^{(0)}=1$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(q+1)}=\infty$. Our analysis makes essential use of the hierarchical tree structure underlying the metastable behavior in different time-scales of the diffusion induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$. This result can be regarded as the precise refinement of Freidlin-Wentzell theory which was not known for more than a half century.</p>

We observe interference patterns resulting from the movement of `electric' excitations in the presence and absence of `magnetic' ones. We model the noise in IonQ via depolarizing Lindbladian dynamics, and find quantitative agreement with the measurements obtained from the quantum device. The synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can thus also serve as an effective means to probe the coherence length and time scales of multi-qubit noisy quantum devices.</p>

            <p>On-chip emitters that can generate single and entangled photons are essential building blocks for developing photonic quantum information processing technologies in a scalable fashion. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive candidates that emit high-quality quantum states of light on demand, however at a rate limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In this study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold enhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs by coupling them to metal-clad GaAs nanopillars. These cavities, featuring a sub-wavelength mode volume of 4.5x10-4 ({\lambda}/n)3 and low quality factor of 62, enable Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission across a large bandwidth of 15 nm. The broadband nature of the cavity eliminates the need for implementing tuning mechanisms typically required to achieve QD-cavity resonance, thus relaxing fabrication constraints. Ultimately, this QD-cavity architecture represents a significant stride towards developing solid-state quantum emitters generating near-ideal single-photon states at GHz-level repetition rates.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the negatively charged group-IV--vacancy defects in diamond, labeled as G4V(-) or G4V centers, have attracted significant attention in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up to 180 GPa. The spin-orbit splitting of the electronic ground and excited states, as well as the hyperfine tensors, are calculated using plane-wave supercell density functional theory, providing distinctive fingerprints that uniquely characterize these defects. To this end, we develop a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the electronic states are subject to the Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the zero-phonon-line energy increases with hydrostatic pressure, with the deformation potential increasing from SiV(-) to PbV(-). On the other hand, our calculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that PbV(-)-based quantum sensors can operate only up to 32 GPa, whereas SnV(-), GeV(-), and SiV(-) remain photostable up to 180 GPa. We also find that the spin-orbit splitting increases in both the electronic ground and excited states with increasing pressure. The optical transitions associated with the hyperfine fine structure of the dopant atoms are interpreted using our theoretical framework, which reproduces existing experimental data at zero strain. We show that the hyperfine levels are weakly dependent on magnetic field, and increasing pressure leads to optical transitions at longer wavelengths. Finally, we estimate the spin coherence times of the G4V centers under increasing hydrostatic pressure across different temperature regimes.</p>

            <p>We consider the three-dimensional (3D) lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs theories with multicomponent ($N_f>1$) degenerate scalar fields and U($N_f$) global symmetry, focusing on systems with $N_c=2$, to identify critical behaviors that can be effectively described by the corresponding 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theory. The field-theoretical analysis of the RG flow allows one to identify a stable charged fixed point for large values of $N_f$, that would control transitions characterized by the global symmetry-breaking pattern ${\rm U}(N_f)\rightarrow \mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Continuous transitions with the same symmetry-breaking pattern are observed in the SU(2) lattice gauge model for $N_f \ge 30$. Here we present a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte Carlo data for several large values of $N_f$. The results are in substantial agreement with the field-theoretical predictions obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit. This provides evidence that the SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories provide the correct effective description of the 3D large-$N_f$ continuous transitions between the disordered and the Higgs phase, where the flavor symmetry breaks to $\mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Therefore, at least for large enough $N_f$, the 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories with multicomponent scalar fields can be nonperturbatively defined by the continuum limit of lattice discretizatized models with the same local and global symmetries.</p>

            <h2>On Acceleration of Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays in a Novel Scenario of Magnetar Transients</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiro Shimoda, Tomoki Wada</p>
            <p>Transient phenomena in magnetars have been considered as possible acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (CRs), whose energy reaches ~200 EeV, such as the Amaterasu particle. However, the process of CR acceleration and the trigger mechanism of magnetar transients remains unclear. A recently suggested scenario for the activity predicts that the magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to the `Dzhanibekov effect,' resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The material in the outer layer plastically flows due to the force and finally fractures in this scenario. We study the possibilities of ion acceleration along with this scenario. If the degenerate electrons burst open from the fractured region like a balloon burst, the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust. We find that such pair plasma can emit photons similar to the observed bursts from magnetars. We also find that the electron stream at the beginning of the burst phenomenon possibly induces a strong electric field for a moment, resulting in the acceleration of ~1 ZeV ion within a timescale of ~1 ps. The nuclear spallation reactions limit this timescale, and therefore, high-energy CR `neutrons' from the parenteral nuclei become proper observational predictions of this scenario: their arrival time and direction will be correlated with the bursting photon emissions of the host magnetars. The nuclear spallation of ~ZeV nuclei is preferred to explain $\gtrsim$10 PeV neutrino events observed by IceCube and KM3Net.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Navid Abbasi, Dirk H. Rischke</p>
            <p>The search for the conjectured QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions requires to account for far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, and in particular non-Gaussian fluctuations, in the modeling of the dynamics of the hot and dense matter created in such collisions. In order to study far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, in this work we construct a Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory (EFT) for the diffusion of the density to all orders in derivatives. The dissipation in the free part of our EFT follows the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). The interaction part of the EFT is constructed based on the self-interaction of the density field. We analytically find the quadratic and cubic parts of the KMS-invariant EFT in closed form, resummed in derivatives. We then explicitly compute the symmetrized three-point function at tree level, and investigate its analytical structure in detail. We also analytically calculate the branch-point singularity that appears in the structure of the two-point response function due to loop effects. Our results are important for future studies of the real-time dynamics of the correlation functions and the possible relation to thermalization when the system is far from equilibrium.</p>

These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Masi, Itai Einav</p>
            <p>The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate- and state-dependent, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</p>

However, the underlying physical mechanisms that lead to maximum chirality remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that maximum chirality in dielectric nanostructures arises from the constructive and destructive interference of multipole moments with different CPL. By employing generalized multipole decomposition, we introduce a generalized chiral multipole mechanism that allows for direct numerical calculation of CD and establishes the conditions required to achieve maximum chirality. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing chirality and serves as a foundation for future investigations of chiral nanostructures.</p>

            <p>We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Becker, Zhongkai Tao, Mengxuan Yang</p>
            <p>This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.</p>

To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples.

            <p>Understanding the fundamental constraint on work far beyond the adiabatic regime is crucial to investigating fast and efficient energy extraction or consumption processes. In this study, we derive thermodynamic speed limits for non-adiabatic work and quantify the fundamental costs of non-adiabatic work extraction or consumption processes in open quantum systems, where the costs are quantified by geometric and thermodynamic quantities. We further decompose the non-adiabatic work into classical and quantum contributions and derive their thermodynamic speed limits, clarifying the classical and quantum nature of the fundamental costs. The obtained results are numerically demonstrated by driven two-level systems.</p>

            <h2>Glued tree lattices with only compact localized states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Osborne, Ciro Salcedo, Andrew A. Houck</p>
            <p>Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.</p>

            <h2>Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</p>

            <h2>Work Statistics and Quantum Trajectories: No-Click Limit and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manali Malakar, Alessandro Silva</p>
            <p>We present a generalized framework for quantum work statistics in continuously monitored quantum systems that extends the conventional two-point measurement scheme to include the effects of multiple generalized measurements and post-selection of no-click trajectories. By deriving a modified generating function for work, our approach naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometry of Finite XY Chains: A Comparison of Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond Sectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nayereh Einali, Hosein Mohammadzadeh, Vadood Adami, Morteza Nattagh Najafi</p>
            <p>This paper presents a geometrical analysis of finite length XY quantum chains. We begin by examining the ground state and the first excited state of the model, emphasizing the impact of finite size effects under two distinct choices of the Jordan Wigner transformation: the Neveu Schwartz (NS) and Ramond (R) sectors. We explore the geometric features of the system by analyzing the quantum (Berry) curvature derived from the Fubini Study metric, which is intimately connected to the quantum Fisher information. This approach uncovers a rich interplay between boundary conditions and quantum geometry. In the gamma h parameter space, we identify distinct sign changing arcs of the curvature, confined to some region. These arcs mark transitions between the NS and R sectors, indicating fundamental changes in the structure of the fermionic ground state. Remarkably, the number of such transition lines increases with system size, hinting at an emergent continuum of topological boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism where boundary conditions shape quantum geometric properties, offering new insights into finite size topology and the structure of low dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</p>

            <h2>Bubble-assisted micromixing via thermally excited intrinsic air within microfluidic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Shahriar Riazi, Seyed Mostafa Hosseinalipour</p>
            <p>The micromixing process in microfluidic devices is of central importance in quite a few applications, with microfluidic studies on carbon capture and environmental monitoring being two examples. High surface area to volume ratio in microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by means of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the typically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we introduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented on a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within microchannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum microheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny crevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan, consuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The performance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index (MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds 95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4, 10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by scaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging elongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as Weber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups while the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing downstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary numbers.</p>

            <p>In order to establish the thermodynamic stability of a system, knowledge of its Gibbs free energy is essential. Most often, the Gibbs free energy is predicted within the CALPHAD framework using models employing thermodynamic properties, such as the mixing enthalpy, heat capacity, and activity coefficients. Here, we present a deep-learning approach capable of predicting the mixing enthalpy of liquid phases of binary systems that were not present in the training dataset. Therefore, our model allows for a system-informed enhancement of the thermodynamic description to unknown binary systems based on information present in the available thermodynamic assessment. Thereby, significant experimental efforts in assessing new systems can be spared. We use an open database for steels containing 91 binary systems to generate our initial training (and validation) and amend it with several direct experimental reports. The model is thoroughly tested using different strategies, including a test of its predictive capabilities. The model shows excellent predictive capabilities outside of the training dataset as soon as some data containing species of the predicted system is included in the training dataset. The estimated uncertainty of the model is below 1 kJ/mol for the predicted mixing enthalpy. Subsequently, we used our model to predict the enthalpy of mixing of all binary systems not present in the original database and extracted the Redlich-Kister parameters, which can be readily reintegrated into the thermodynamic database file.</p>

            <p>Polaritons in van-der-Waals materials (vdWM) promise high confinement and multiple tailoring options by optical structures, e.g., resonators, launching structures and lenses. These optical structures are conventionally fabricated using cumbersome multi-process lithography techniques. In contrast, phase-change materials (PCMs) offer fast and reconfigurable programming of optical structures. PCMs can reversibly be switched between two stable phases with distinct permittivities by local heating, e.g., by optical laser pulses. While the well-known dielectric PCM GeSbTe-alloys feature only a permittivity change, the PCM In3SbTe2 can be switched between a dielectric and metallic phase. This makes In3SbTe2 promising for programming metallic launching structures. Here, we demonstrate direct optical programming and thereby rapid prototyping of optical launching structures in In3SbTe2 to tailor and confine polaritons in vdWM. We combine the vdWM hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with In3SbTe2 and optically program circular resonators for hBN's phonon polaritons through hBN into In3SbTe2. We investigate the polariton resonators with near-field optical microscopy. Demonstrating the reconfigurability, we decrease the resonator diameter to increase the polariton confinement. Finally, we fabricate focusing structures for hBN's phonon polaritons whose focal point is changed in a second post-processing step. We promote In3SbTe2 as a versatile platform for rapid prototyping of polariton optics in vdWM.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seik Pak, Hanbyul Kim, Chan Bin Bark, Sang-Jin Sin, Jae-yoon Choi, Moon Jip Park</p>
            <p>The eta-pairing state is the eigenstate of the hypercubic Hubbard model, which exhibits anomalous logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. In multi-band systems, eta-pairing can be exact eigenstate when the band is flat without interband coupling. However, typical flatband systems such as Lieb and Kagome lattices often feature band touchings, where interband coupling effects are non-negligible. Using the Creutz ladder, we investigate the deformation of eta-pairing states under the interband coupling effect. Our results show corrections to entanglement entropy scaling, with modified eta-pairing states displaying broadened doublons, nonuniform energy spacing, and deviations from exact behavior for configurations with more than one eta-pair, even in the large band gap limit, except at t = 0. Through a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we quantify corrections to the spectrum generating algebra, offering insights into the interplay between interaction-driven phenomena and band structure effects. These findings illuminate the robustness and limitations of eta-pairing in realistic flatband systems.</p>

            <p>Group IV quantum dot hole spin systems, exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling, provide platforms for various qubit architectures. The rapid advancement of solid-state technologies has significantly improved qubit quality, including the time scales characterizing electrical operation, relaxation, and dephasing. At this stage of development, understanding the relations between the underlying spin-orbit coupling and experimental parameters, such as quantum dot geometry and external electric and magnetic fields, has become a priority. Here we focus on a Ge hole double quantum dot in the Pauli spin blockade regime and present a complete analysis of the leakage current under an out-of-plane magnetic field. By considering a model of anisotropic in-plane confinement and $k^3$-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we determine the behaviour of the leakage current as a function of detuning, magnetic field magnitude, interdot distance, and individual dot ellipticities. We identify regions in which the leakage current can be suppressed by quantum dot geometry designs. Most importantly, by rotating one of the quantum dots, we observe that the quantum dot shape induces a strongly anisotropic leakage current. These findings provide guidelines for probing the spin-orbit coupling, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the precision of Pauli spin blockade readout in hole qubit architectures.</p>

            <p>On demand current-driven insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) is pivotal for the next generation of energy-efficient and scalable microelectronics. IMT is a key phenomenon observed in various quantum materials, and it is enabled by the complex interplay of spin, lattice, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom (DOF). Despite significant prior work, the underlying mechanism of the current-driven IMT remains elusive, primarily due to the difficulty in simultaneously obtaining bulk fingerprints of all the electronic DOF. Here, we employ in-operando resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) on Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, a prototypical strongly correlated material, to track the evolution of the electronic DOF encoded in the RIXS spectra during the current-driven IMT. Upon entering the conductive state, we observe an energy-selective suppression of the RIXS intensity, proportional to the current. Using complementary RIXS cross-section calculations, we demonstrate that the non-equilibrium conductive state emerges from the formation of correlated electronic states with a persistent Mott gap.</p>

            <p>Lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their exceptional properties. In the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites, ferroelastic domains formed during phase transitions enhance bulk transport and emissive efficiency. However, the microscopic mechanisms governing carrier dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we employ cathodoluminescence (CL) and micro-Raman spectroscopy to image and investigate the electronic properties of the ferroelastic domain walls in CsPbBr3 single crystals. CL measurements reveal a reduced emissive yield and a slight redshift in emission at the domain walls. Further, micro-Raman studies provide spatially resolved mapping of vibrational modes, exhibiting second-order phonon modes localized at the domain boundaries. Our findings suggest that electron-phonon coupling at twin domain walls plays a critical role in facilitating efficient charge separation, thereby improving the optoelectronic performance of the CsPbBr3 perovskites.</p>

            <p>Superconducting thin metallic films, functioning as supercurrent gate-tunable transistors, have considerable potential for future quantum electronic devices. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive microscopic quantitative mechanism that elucidates the control or suppression of supercurrents in thin films remains elusive. Focusing on NbN, a prototypical material, and starting from a phenomenological ansatz that links the critical electric field with the kinetic energy parameter needed to break Cooper pairs, we provide a quantitative analysis of the critical current using Eliashberg theory in the dirty limit without adjustable parameters. The critical kinetic energy value is identified, corresponding to the maximum supercurrent that can flow in the thin film. The peak in supercurrent density as a function of the Cooper pairs' kinetic energy arises from the interplay between the increase in supercurrent due to increased kinetic energy and the depairing effect when the kinetic energy becomes sufficiently large. The critical value of the pair's kinetic energy is subsequently employed to estimate the critical value of an external electric field required to suppress superconductivity in the sample. This estimation is in parameter-free agreement with the experimental observations. Although the disorder reduces the temperature dependence of the gating effect on the critical current, at the same time, it increases the unscreened critical electric field needed to suppress superconductivity. This enables the proposal of methods to control and reduce the critical field value necessary to suppress superconductivity in superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p>The theoretical description of materials' properties driven out of equilibrium has important consequences in various fields such as semiconductor spintronics, nonlinear optics, continuous and discrete quantum information science and technology. The coupling of a quantum many-body system to an external bath can dramatically modify its dynamics compared to that of closed systems, new phenomena like relaxation and decoherence appear as a consequence of the nonunitary evolution of the quantum system. In addition, electron-electron correlations must be properly accounted for in order to go beyond a simple one-electron or mean-field description of the electronic system. Here we discuss a first-principles methodology based on the evolution of the electronic density matrix capable of treating electron-environment interactions and electron-electron correlations at the same level of description. The effect of the environment is separated in a coherent contribution, like the coupling to applied external electro-magnetic fields, and an incoherent contribution, like the interaction with lattice vibrations or the thermal background of radiation. Electron-electron interactions are included using the nonequilibrium Green's function plus generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz. The obtained non-Markovian coupled set of equations reduce to ordinary Lindblad quantum master equation form in the Markovian limit.</p>

            <p>Strong Coulomb repulsion is predicted to open a many-body charge gap at the Dirac point of graphene, transforming the semimetal into a Mott insulator. However, this correlated insulating phase has remained inaccessible in pristine graphene, where a large Fermi velocity dominates the interaction effects. To overcome this limitation, we realize a honeycomb moir{√©} superlattice in a twisted MoSe$_2$ homobilayer, where a graphene-like band structure forms with a Fermi velocity reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude. These slow moir{√©} bands are folded from the valence band maximum at the $\Gamma$ valley of the extended Brillouin zone with negligible spin-orbital coupling, and can therefore simulate massless Dirac fermions in the strongly correlated regime with full SU(2) symmetry. By correlating Rydberg exciton sensing with moir{√©} trions of different spatial characters, we detect a Mott gap at the Dirac point that persists up to 110 K. We further identify correlated insulating states at $\nu=-1$ with a weak ferromagnetic coupling as well as at several fractional fillings. Our results highlight the potential of studying a wide range of quantum many-body phenomena in twisted two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>Thermochromic vanadium dioxide thin films have attracted much attention recently for constructing variable-emittance coatings upon its insulator-metal phase transition for dynamic thermal control. However, fabrication of high-quality vanadium dioxide thin films in a cost-effective way is still a challenge. In addition, the phase transition temperature of vanadium dioxide is around 68¬∞C, which is higher than most of terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications. In this study, we report the fabrication and characterization of tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films with lowered phase transition temperatures via co-sputtering, furnace oxidation and thermal annealing processes for wider application needs. The doping is achieved by co-sputtering of tungsten and vanadium targets while the doping level is varied by carefully controlling the sputtering power for tungsten. Doped thin film samples of 30-nm thick with different tungsten atomic concentrations are prepared by co-sputtering onto undoped silicon wafers. Optimal oxidation time of 4 hours is determined to reach full oxidation in an oxygen-rich furnace environment at 300¬∞C. Systematic thermal annealing study is carried out to find the optimal annealing temperature and time. By using an optical cryostat coupled to an infrared spectrometer, the temperature-dependent infrared transmittance of fully annealed tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films are measured in a wide temperature range from -60¬∞C to 100¬∞C. The phase transition temperature is found to decrease at 24.5¬∞C per at.% of tungsten doping, and the thermal hysteresis between heating and cooling shrinks at 5.5¬∞C per at.% from the fabricated vanadium dioxide thin films with tungsten doping up to 4.1 at.%.</p>

We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal electronic correlations. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.</p>

            <p>Exciton-phonon interactions play a fundamental role in phonon-assisted radiative recombination and exciton dynamics in solids. In this work, we present a first-principles framework for computing phonon-assisted radiative lifetimes and exciton dynamics at finite temperatures. Starting from the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we construct an effective excitonic Hamiltonian that incorporates both exciton-photon and exciton-phonon interactions. Phonon-assisted radiative lifetimes in anisotropic media are evaluated using time-dependent second-order perturbation theory. We further analyze the temperature and phonon-mode dependence of phonon-assisted radiative lifetime and compare our results with available experimental data. We explain the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the phonon-assisted radiative lifetime by different mechanisms at low and high-temperature regimes. Finally, we perform real-time exciton relaxation at the diagonal approximation of Lindbladian dynamics for time-resolved exciton occupation, providing insights into ultrafast thermalization and scattering pathways. Our ab-initio theory offers a detailed microscopic understanding of phonon-mediated exciton relaxation and recombination processes, and provides in-depth perspectives on phonon-assisted many-body interactions and their influence on optical properties for light-emitting and optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>We propose an experimental scheme to realize phase transition from {\it dark superradiance} to conventional superradiance in a microwave cavity coupled to polar molecules. The competition between cavity-mediated infinite-range repulsions and finite-range attractive dipolar interactions stabilizes a variety of exotic quantum phases, including vortex, vortex anti-vortex pairs, and superradiant phase, all emerging without external driving fields. In vortex phase associated with {\it dark superradiance}, cavity remains in vacuum state while profoundly reshaping the condensate's ground-state wave functions. In particular, the spin configuration locally parallel but globally anti-parallel is a direct consequence of competing for two nonlocal interactions. Beyond Dicke paradigm, dipolar dressing of condensate enables access to an unexplored regime of repulsion-dominated superradiance. A Bogoliubov analysis of low-energy excitation spectrum confirms that the condensate remains stable, avoiding roton-maxon induced collapse even in strongly dipolar regime.</p>

            <p>Metal halide perovskite solar cells have achieved dramatic improvements in their power conversion efficiency in the recent past. Since compositional engineering plays an important role in optimizing material properties, we investigate the effect of alloying at Cs and Pb sites on the energetics and electronic structure of CsPbI$_{3}$ using cluster expansion method in combination with first-principles calculations. For Ge-mixing at Pb-site, the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-phases are considered with emphasis on the electronic structure, transition probability, absorption coefficient, efficiency, and carrier mobility of higher-symmetry configurations. CsPb$_{0.50}$Ge$_{0.50}$I$_{3}$ (Cs$_{2}$PbGeI$_{6}$) which takes up a double perovskite (elpasolite) structure has a direct band gap with no parity-forbidden transitions. Further, we utilize the alloy entropic effect to improve the material stability and optoelectronic properties of CsPbI$_{3}$ by multi-element mixing. For the proposed mixed compositions, the Fr{√∂}hlich electron-phonon coupling constant is determined. Scattering rates and electron mobility are obtained from first-principles inputs. These lower Pb-content inorganic perovskites offer great promise as efficient solar cell materials for photovoltaic applications.</p>

            <h2>Valley Polarization and Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in Altermagnet Ti2Se2S with Multipiezo Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Hu, Weihang Zhao, Wenjun Xia, Hanbo Sun, Chao Wu, Yin-Zhong Wu, Ping Li</p>
            <p>Recently, altermagnets demonstrate numerous newfangle physical phenomena due to their inherent antiferromagnetic coupling and spontaneous spin splitting, that are anticipated to enable innovative spintronic devices. However, the rare two-dimensional altermagnets have been reported, making it difficult to meet the requirements for high-performance spintronic devices on account of the growth big data. Here, we predict a stable monolayer Ti2Se2S with out-of-plane altermagnetic ground state and giant valley splitting. The electronic properties of altermagnet Ti2Se2S are highly dependent on the onsite electron correlation. Through symmetry analysis, we find that the valleys of X and Y points are protected by the mirror Mxy symmetry rather than the time-reversal symmetry. Therefore, the multipiezo effect, including piezovalley and piezomagnetism, can be induced by the uniaxial strain. The total valley splitting of monolayer Ti2Se2S can be as high as ~500 meV. Most interestingly, the direction of valley polarization can be effectively tuned by the uniaxial strain, based on this, we have defined logical "0", "+1", and "-1" states for data transmission and storage. In addition, we have designed a schematic diagram for observing the anomalous Hall effect in experimentally. Our findings have enriched the candidate materials of two-dimensional altermagnet for the ultra-fast and low power consumption device applications.</p>

            <h2>The possible frustrated superconductivity in the kagome superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Min Jiang, Wen-Qian Dong, Shun-Li Yu, Z. D. Wang</p>
            <p>Geometric frustration has long been a subject of enduring interest in condensed matter physics. While geometric frustration traditionally focuses on magnetic systems, little attention is paid to the "frustrated superconductivity" which could arise when the superconducting interaction conflicts with the crystal symmetry. The recently discovered kagome superconductors provide a particular opportunity for studying this due to the fact that the frustrated lattice structure and the interference effect between the three sublattices can facilitate the frustrated superconducting interaction. Here, we propose a theory that supports the frustrated superconducting state, derived from the on-site $s$-wave superconducting pairing in conjunction with the nearest-neighbor pairings hoping and the unique geometrical frustrated lattice structure. In this state, whereas the mutual $2\pi/3$ difference of the superconducting pairing phase causes the six-fold modulation of the amplitude and breaks the time-reversal symmetry with $4\pi$ phase changes of the superconducting pairing as one following it around the Fermi surface, it is immune to the impurities without the impurity-induced in-gap states and produces the pronounced Hebel-Slichter peak of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate below $T_{c}$. Notably, the theory also reveals a disorder-induced superconducting pairing transition from the frustrated superconducting state to an isotropic $s$-wave superconducting state without traversing the nodal points, recovering and explaining the behavior found in experiment. This study not only serves as a promising proposal to mediate the divergent or seemingly contradictory experimental outcomes regarding superconducting pairing symmetry, but may also pave the way for advancing investigations into the frustrated superconducting state.</p>

            <h2>Coupled-wire Construction of a Non-crystalline Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin Schirmann, Peru d'Ornellas, Adolfo G. Grushin</p>
            <p>The fractional quantum Hall effect, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, has been realised in two-dimensional strongly correlated quantum gases and Chern bands of crystals. Here we construct a non-crystalline analogue by coupling quantum wires that are not periodically placed in real-space. Remarkably, the model remains solvable using bosonisation techniques. Due to the non-uniform couplings between the wires, the ground state has different degeneracy compared to the crystalline case. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), anyons confined to hop between two wires (s-lineons), and anyonic excitations that are free to travel across the system. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires. By providing an analytically solvable model of a non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effect, our work showcases that topological order can display richer phenomenology beyond crystals. More broadly, the non-uniform wire construction we develop can serve as a tool to explore richer many-body phenomenology in non-crystalline systems.</p>

            <p>SrCr$_2$As$_2$ is an itinerant antiferromagnet in the same structural family as the SrFe$_2$As$_2$ high-temperature superconductors. We report our calculations of exchange-coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ for SrCr$_2$As$_2$ using a static linear-response method based on first-principles electronic-structure calculations. We find that the dominant nearest-neighbor exchange coupling $J_{\rm{1}} > 0$ is antiferromagnetic whereas the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_{\rm{2}} < 0$ is ferromagnetic with $J_{\rm{2}}$/$J_{\rm{1}}$~=~$-0.68$, reinforcing the checkerboard in-plane magnetic structure. Thus, unlike other transition-metal arsenides based on Mn, Fe, or Co, we find no competing magnetic interactions in SrCr$_2$As$_2$, which aligns with experimental findings. Moreover, the orbital resolution of exchange interactions shows that $J_1$ and $J_2$ are dominated by direct exchange mediated by the Cr $d$ orbitals. To validate the calculations we conduct inelastic neutron-scattering measurements on powder samples that show steeply dispersive magnetic excitations arising from the magnetic $\Gamma$ points and persisting up to energies of at least 175 meV. The spin-wave spectra are then modeled using the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with the theoretically-calculated exchange couplings. The calculated neutron-scattering spectra are in good agreement with the experimental data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Amari, Muneto Nitta</p>
            <p>We study a magnetic domain wall in the ferromagnetic phase in chiral magnets in two dimensions with an in-plane easy-axis anisotropy and an out-of-plane Zeeman magnetic field, and find a chiral soliton lattice (spiral) phase beside a ferromagnetic phase inside the domain line, where the former represents a domain-wall skyrmion crystal from the bulk point of view. We first determine the phase diagram on the domain wall by numerically constructing domain-wall solutions. We then analytically reproduce the phase diagram in a domain-wall theory (a chiral double sine-Gordon model) that we construct within the moduli approximation by treating the Zeeman magnetic field perturbatively. While we find good agreements between the phase diagrams of the numerical and effective theory methods, the numerical solution exhibits a decomposition of the topological charge into a bimeron which cannot be captured by the effective theory.</p>

We show that in some of our models, the desired altermagnetic order can be spontaneously realized by electron-electron interaction in a broad range of the phase diagram. This development facilitates the study of fascinating physics of altermagnetism and sheds light on the discovery of new altermagnetic materials.</p>

            <p>The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, F$_c$, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of T$_c$ = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at F$_c$ were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at T$_c$. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near T$_c$, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Hadi Yarloo, Hua-Chen Zhang, Klaus M√∏lmer, Anne E. B. Nielsen</p>
            <p>Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space. The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art Rydberg array setups.</p>

            <p>The transfer of quantum information between many-qubit states is a subject of fundamental importance in quantum science and technology. We consider entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains, where the entanglement between the two chains is induced solely by the Bell-state measurements. We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.</p>

            <h2>Integrative Learning of Quantum Dot Intensity Fluctuations under Excitation via Tailored Dynamic Mixture Modeling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Yang, Hawi Nyiera, Yonglei Sun, Jing Zhao, Kun Chen</p>
            <p>Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have attracted significant attention for their unique fluorescence properties. Under continuous excitation, QDs emit photons with intricate intensity fluctuation: the intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different QDs even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. Conventional normality-based single-dot analysis fall short of addressing these complexities. In collaboration with chemists, we develop an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series from multiple QDs. Motivated by the unique data structure and the hypothesized behaviors of the QDs, our approach leverages the celebrated hidden Markov model as its structural backbone to characterize individual dot intensity fluctuations, while assuming that, in each state the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, the state/emission distributions are shared across the QDs, and the state transition dynamics can vary among a few QD clusters. This framework allows for a precise, collective characterization of intensity fluctuation patterns and have the potential to transform current practice in chemistry. Applying our method to experimental data from 128 QDs, we reveal three shared intensity states and capture several distinct intensity transition patterns, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in providing deeper insights into QD behaviors and their design and application potential.</p>

            <p>Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.</p>

Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in Liquid Crystals, it has been successfully employed for the characterization of ferro-, antiferro- and ferri-electric liquid crystalline phases. However, recently the Boulder group raised the question of the applicability of dielectric spectroscopy for characterizing ferroelectric nematics due to parasitic effects from the insulating alignment layers. This affects the apparent/measured values of the dielectric permittivity. In this paper, we study this effect in greater detail. The following issues will receive special attention: Are the real values of dielectric permittivity lower or higher than the measured ones? Can the real values of dielectric permittivity be recovered in the cell with alignment layers? We also provide an example of the effect of insulating alignment layers in a non-ferroelectric nematic phase.</p>

            <p>Josephson diode (JD) effect found in Josephson tunnel junctions (JTJs) has attracted a great deal of attention due to its importance for developing superconducting circuitry based quantum technologies. So far, the highly desirable electrical control of the JD effect has not been demonstrated in any JTJ prepared by techniques used in semiconductor industry. We report the fabrication of JTJs featuring a composite tunnel barrier of Al$_2$O$_3$ and Hf$_{\mathrm{0.8}}$Zr$_\mathrm{0.2}$O$_2$ prepared by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). These JTJs were found to show the JD effect in nominally zero magnetic fields with the nonreciprocity controllable using an electric training current, yielding a surprisingly large diode efficiency not achieved previously. The quasiparticle tunneling, through which the Josephson coupling in a JTJ is established, was found to show no nonreciprocity. We attribute these observations to the simultaneous presence of positive and negative Josephson couplings, with the latter originating from indirect tunneling. The resulted spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking and the double-minima washboard potential for the ensemble averaged phase difference in the resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model are shown to fully account for the experimentally observed JD effect.</p>

            <p>We introduce a new type of supercurrent valve based on full-shell nanowires. These hybrid wires consist of a semiconductor core fully wrapped in a thin superconductor shell and subjected to an axial magnetic field. Due to the tubular shape of the shell, the superconductor phase acquires an integer number $n$ of $2\pi$ twists or fluxoids that increases in steps with applied flux. By connecting two such hybrid wires, forming a Josephson junction (JJ), a flux-modulated supercurrent develops. If the two superconducting sections of the JJ have different radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, they can develop equal or different fluxoid numbers $n_1,n_2$ depending on the field. If $n_1\neq n_2$ the supercurrent is blocked, while it remains finite for $n_1=n_2$. This gives rise to a fluxoid valve effect controlled by the applied magnetic field. We define a fluxoid-valve quality factor that is perfect for cylindrically symmetric systems and decreases as this symmetry is reduced. We further discuss the role of Majorana zero modes at the junction when the full shell-nanowires are in topological superconducting regime.</p>

            <p>Quantum link models extend lattice gauge theories beyond the traditional Wilson formulation and present promising candidates for both digital and analog quantum simulations. Fermionic matter coupled to $U(1)$ quantum link gauge fields has been extensively studied, revealing a phase diagram that includes transitions from the columnar phase in the quantum dimer model to the resonating valence bond phase in the quantum link model, potentially passing through a disordered liquid-like phase. In this study, we investigate the model coupled to hardcore bosons and identify a similar phase structure, though with a more intricate mixture of phases around the transition. Our analysis reveals that near the transition region, a narrow and distinct ordered phase emerges, characterized by gauge fields forming plaquette configurations with alternating orientations, which is then followed by a thinner, liquid-like regime. This complexity primarily stems from the differences in particle statistics, which manifest prominently when the matter degrees of freedom become dynamic. Notably, our findings suggest that bosons can effectively replace fermions in lattice gauge theory simulations, offering solutions to the challenges posed by fermions in both digital and analog quantum simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B≈Ça≈ºej Jaworowski, Darrick E. Chang</p>
            <p>Atom arrays with sub-wavelength lattice constant can exhibit fascinating optical properties. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems focuses on the single-excitation regime. In one relevant example, the combination of multiple excited states and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, albeit with dispersion relations that can exhibit divergences near the light cone. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the divergences can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces.</p>

            <p>Magnetic bilayers consisting of an epitaxially grown ferrimagnetic insulator and a heavy metal layer are attractive for spintronic application because of the opportunity for electric control and read-out of spin textures via spin orbit torque. Here, we investigate ultrathin thulium iron garnet (TmIG)/Pt bilayers when the TmIG layer thickness is 3 nm and below using a sensitive Sagnac magneto-optical Kerr effect technique. We compare the hysteresis loops from out-of-plane and in-plane applied magnetic fields. The preferred magnetization orientation evolves with the TmIG thickness and the presence of the Pt overlayer. We quantify the evolution of the magnetic anisotropy in these ultrathin films and find a significant change even when the TmIG thickness is varied by less than 1 nm. In these ultrathin films, the presence of a Pt overlayer changes the effective anisotropy field by more than a factor of 2, suggesting that the interfacial anisotropy at the Pt/TmIG interface plays a critical role in this regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan Li</p>
            <p>In non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals based on rare-earth compounds, the correlation effects among $f$ electrons may play a crucial role in shaping the properties of Weyl nodes, potentially giving rise to magnetic Weyl semimetals or correlated Weyl excitations. Here, we investigates a recently identified class of magnetic rare-earth Weyl semimetals, RGaGe (R = La, Ce, and Pr). By employing a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations, we demonstrate that under ambient pressure, the $f$ electrons in CeGaGe and PrGaGe are nearly fully localized. Concurrently, three inequivalent types of Weyl nodes emerge near the Fermi level due to intersections between $spd$ bands. Notably, one type of Weyl point exhibits substantial chiral separation (significantly greater than in CeAlSi and CeAlGe), leading to the formation of long and well-defined surface Fermi arcs on the (001) surface. These Fermi arcs remain well-separated by bulk states, thereby facilitating future experimental observations. In contrast, the chiral separation of Weyl points in LaGaGe is relatively modest. Upon application of volume compression, the $f$ electrons in CeGaGe progressively become itinerant and begin to obscure the Weyl nodes formed by $spd$ electrons, rendering them less accessible for direct observation. These findings suggest that in correlated materials, particularly $f$-electron systems, even when $f$ electrons do not directly contribute to the formation of topological nodes, they can still exert a profound influence on the characteristics of Weyl nodes.</p>

            <h2>Quantum geometry and elliptic optical dichroism in $p$-wave magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Motohiko Ezawa</p>
            <p>The quantum geometric tensor is composed of the Berry curvature and the quantum metric, which is observable by means of optical absorption of elliptically polarized light. Especially, the quantum geometric tensor at the zero-momentum is observable by the optical absorption at the optical band edge. In this context, we study optical absorption of a $p$-wave magnet under irradiation of elliptically polarized light. The $p$-wave magnet has a band splitting along one axis, which we choose the $x$ axis. We obtain analytic formulae for the optical conductivity up to the second order in the magnitude of the N√©el vector. In particular, the optical conductivity is exactly obtained when the N√©el is along the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axis. It shows strong ellipticity a dependence of the light polarization, which is an elliptic dichroism. Especially, there is a perfect elliptic optical dichroism when the N√©el vector is along the $y$ axis. It is possible to determine the N√©el vector by measuring the ellipticity of the perfect elliptic dichroism.</p>

            <p>Driven quantum materials with on demand properties controlled by external stimuli are critical for emergent quantum technology. In optically tunable superconducting heterostructures, the lattice responses at the buried interface may hold the key to the light susceptibility but is very challenging to detect. In this work, a nondestructive synchrotron-based X-ray scattering phase-retrieval technique is implemented in monolayer-FeSe/SrTiO3 heterostructures to capture the three-dimensional interfacial atomic displacements in-situ as the interface superconductivity is actively manipulated by light. It is found that the interlayer sliding between FeSe and SrTiO3 can drastically alter how the lattice responds to the light. In domains with selected stacking configurations, the interface transforms the very weak photoexcitation in SrTiO3 into significant Fe-atom displacements in FeSe and generate metastable interfacial structures that can lead to a persistent superconductivity enhancement. These findings demonstrate an effective strategy for achieving greatly amplified light-lattice coupling for efficient quantum phase manipulations at designed interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Time-resolved dynamics of GaN waveguide polaritons</h2>

            <p>We implement a new experimental approach to directly measure the lifetime of guided polaritons arising from the strong-coupling of GaN excitons and the guided photonic modes of a slab waveguide. Using a Fourier imaging setup, combined with spatial filtering of the emission, the emission associated to polaritonic modes with well-defined propagation constants can be selectively analyzed in the temporal domain. By directing it to the entrance slit of a streak camera, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements along the polariton dispersion branch were performed at 40 K, enabling to assess the time decay of polariton modes. By combining this information with the photonic/excitonic fraction corresponding to each polariton mode, extracted from a coupled-oscillators model that indicate a Rabi splitting of $\Omega$ = 80 meV, we could extract the photon lifetime in the waveguide $\tau_\gamma\, =\, 3\pm 1$ ps. This corresponds to a record $Q$-factor in the UV of 16 000. The excitonic reservoir lifetime, which contributes to polariton formation, was determined through TRPL measurements on excitonic luminescence. Finally, measurements conducted at lower temperature highlight secondary feeding mechanisms for the guided polaritonic mode, either via photon recycling from the AlGaN cladding layer or through resonant injection of photons from transitions below the band gap.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical model for a transversally driven Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity. We focus on the interplay between different coherent couplings, which can trigger a structural phase transition, known as the superradiant phase transition. Our approach, based on band structure theory and a mean-field description, enables a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the system's excited modes, precursing the phase transitions. By incorporating dissipative couplings, intrinsic to these systems, we find non-Hermitian phenomena such as the coalescence of crossing precursor modes and the emergence of exceptional points (EPs). The general formulation of our model allows us to explain the role of an angle between transverse pump and the cavity deviating from $90^\circ$. This offers us a unified perspective on the plethora of different implementations of such systems.</p>

            <p>We show that vortices with circulating current, related with odd-frequency triplet pairing, appear in Josephson junctions where the barrier is a weak ferromagnet with strong spin-orbit coupling. By both symmetry analysis and microscopic methods we show that there is an additional term - a rotary invariant - in the superconducting free energy which allows for magnetoelectric effects even when the previously considered Lifshitz invariant vanishes. We show that the size, shape, and position of these vortices can be controlled by manipulating Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the weak link, via gates, and we suggest that these vortices could be detected via scanning magnetometry techniques. We also show that the transverse triplet components of the superconducting correlations can form a texture.</p>

            <h2>Effective Equilibrium Theory of Quantum Light-Matter Interaction in Cavities: Extended Systems and the Long Wavelength Approximation</h2>

            <p>When light and matter interact strongly, the resulting hybrid system inherits properties from both constituents, allowing one to modify material behavior by engineering the surrounding electromagnetic environment. This concept underlies the emerging paradigm of cavity materials engineering, which aims at the control of material properties via tailored vacuum fluctuations of dark photonic environments. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging due to the combined complexity of extended electronic states and quantum electromagnetic fields. Here, we derive an effective, non-perturbative theory for low-dimensional crystals embedded in a Fabry-P√©rot resonator, within the long-wavelength limit. Our approach incorporates the multimode and dispersive nature of the cavity field and reduces it to an effective single-mode description by imposing the condition of negligible momentum transfer from light to matter. Importantly, the resulting effective mode is characterized by a finite mode volume-even in the limit of extended cavities-which is directly linked to realistic cavity parameters. This ensures that the light-matter coupling remains finite in bulk systems. By explicitly accounting for the finite reflectivity of cavity mirrors, our theory also avoids double counting the contribution from free-space light-matter coupling. Overall, our results provide a robust and realistic framework for describing cavity-matter interactions at the Hamiltonian level, incorporating the electromagnetic environment beyond the idealized perfect-mirror approximation.</p>

            <h2>Universal Planckian relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Shekhter, B. J. Ramshaw, M. K. Chan, N. Harrison</p>
            <p>A major puzzle in understanding high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity is the microscopic origin of the linear-in-temperature ($T$-linear) resistivity in the strange metal state, which persists up to very high temperatures. Implicit to existing theoretical discussions of this universal `{Planckian}' relaxation rate is the assumption that it must also be independent of doping, $p$. Applied to the cuprates, however, this apparently contradicts the observed strong doping-dependence ($\propto 1/p$) of the slope of the $T$-linear resistivity over a wide doping range. Here, we show through a combination of measurements, including optical conductivity and entropy, that the plasma frequency squared $\omega_p^2$ scales as $p$ over a similar doping range. Together, these dependences provide compelling evidence that the relaxation rate $1/\tau$ is indeed doping-independent (i.e. universal) throughout the entire strange metal state. Furthermore, we argue that the entire doping dependence of $\omega_p^2$ can be understood to arise from an effective mass enhancement of a specific form proposed by Anderson [\emph{Science} \textbf{235}, 1196 (1987)] in the context of doped Mott insulators. Such a mass enhancement originates from strong short-range repulsive interactions, while the Planckian relaxation rate itself appears to be an emergent phenomenon of independent physical origin.</p>

            <h2>Moir√© amplification of highly tunable shift current response in twisted trilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuncheng Mao, Claudio Attaccalite, Diego Garc√≠a Ovalle</p>
            <p>In this work we analyze the shift current conductivity in helical twisted trilayer graphene. Without loss of generality, we show that the density of states and the twist angle set an upper bound for this response, which is inversely proportional to the square of the twist angle. For the case of ABA stacking and at the magic angle, the shift photoconductivity can reach values of order $10^4~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ for frequencies below 50 meV, which can be attributed to the interband transitions between the two flattened middle bands close to the Fermi level. By tuning the twist angle, we demonstrate that the photoconductivity is shifted in the frequency range and it is further influenced by two additional factors: The magnitude of the shift vector and the energy separation between the bands. Furthermore, we propose a scenario in the AAA stacked configuration, where the photoconductivity can be of order $10^5~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ in the THz regime, revealing a potential influence of the stacking in the optimization of the shift current conductivity. Therefore, a large density of states, a small twist angle and the layer stacking are ingredients that hold promising functionality for photovoltaic applications in moir√© heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical framework to investigate spin chirality in molecular quantum systems. Focusing on a minimal three-spin-center model with antiferromagnetic exchange and symmetry breaking driven by an electric-field-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and applied magnetic fields-give rise to chiral ground states characterized by nonzero scalar spin chirality, $\chi = \textbf{S}_1\cdot(\textbf{S}_r\times \textbf{S}_2)$. The emergent chiral qubits naturally suppress always-on interactions that can not be switched off in weakly coupled qubits, as demonstrated through Liouville-von Neumann dynamics, which reveal phase difference in superposition states that form chiral qubits. To validate this framework, we examine realistic lanthanide complexes with radical-bridged magnetic centers, where spin-orbit coupling and asymmetric exchange facilitate chirality. Our findings establish spin chirality engineering as a promising strategy for mitigating always-on interaction in entangling two chiral qubits in molecular quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate $La_3Ni_2O_7$ has emerged as a superconductor with a transition temperature ($T_c$) of ~ 80 K above 14 GPa$^{[1-4]}$. Efforts to search for nickelate superconductors with higher $T_c$$^{[5,6]}$, to grow reproducible high-quality single crystals$^{[2,7-10]}$, and to eliminate reliance on demanding high gas pressure synthesis conditions$^{[11]}$, remain significant challenges. Here we report superconductivity up to 92 K under high pressure in single crystals of bilayer nickelates synthesized at ambient pressure using flux methods. High quality $La_2SmNi_2O_{7-{\delta}}$ single crystals with dimensions up to 220 {\mu}m on edge were successfully grown. At ~ 15 GPa, these crystals exhibit superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c^{onset}$) of 68 K and zero-resistance temperature ($T_c^{zero}$) of 47 K. Increasing pressure further enhances both transition temperatures, reaching record values for nickelates: $T_{c,max}^{onset}$ = 92 K and $T_{c,max}^{zero}$ = 73 K @ 21 GPa. Notably, higher $T_c$ correlates with larger in-plane lattice distortion at ambient conditions for bilayer nickelates. Furthermore, we observed a structural transition from monoclinic $P2_1/a$ to tetragonal $I4/mmm$ at ~ 18 GPa, indicating that tetragonal structure is not a prerequisite for superconductivity to appear in this bilayer nickelate. This study provides an easy-to-access method for growing reproducible high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals and offers new insights into achieving higher Tc superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenrong Liu, Zhi Lin</p>
            <p>We utilize the cluster Gutzwiller mean-field method to explore ground-state phases and demixing effects in synthetic-dimensional binary boson mixtures with pair hopping. Our investigation uncovers two exotic interspecies paired superfluids: (i) the PSCF phase, characterized by bosonic `four-particle' correlations (two particles of one species paired with two holes of the other), analogous to fermionic charge-4e superconductivity; (ii) the SCF$^*$ phase, hosting coexisting PSCF and super-counter-fluidity orders, serves as the bosonic analog of fermionic charge-2e/4e superconducting coexistence. Both phases exhibit distinct XY ferromagnetic states at varying fillings, including unreported pseudo-spin phases. A quantum quadruple critical point emerges under interexchange asymmetry. Crucially, pair hopping introduces phase-dependent mixed-demixed criticality, deviating from conventional two-component bosonic systems. We propose experimental protocols leveraging noise correlations and Feshbach resonance techniques to probe these states.</p>

            <p>This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.</p>

            <h2>Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya Banerjee</p>
            <p>The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferromagnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states and recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jushin Tei, Takeshi Mizushima, Satoshi Fujimoto</p>
            <p>We propose the surface of topological superconductors as a platform for realizing two-dimensional flat bands, where electron interactions play a crucial role. The surface flat bands originate from topological features supported by two key mechanisms: (1) a trivial Chern number prevents the zero-energy states from merging into the continuum of the bulk spectrum, thereby ensuring their confinement within the superconducting gap; and (2) weak spin conservation allows the gap function to exhibit phase winding. As a consequence, the surface exhibits a remarkably high density of states at nearly zero energy. Such surface states are likely to be realized in the candidate topological superconductor UTe$_2$. Our results provide important insights into the interpretation of recent Josephson STM experiments on UTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of broken time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$), typically used to study ferromagnets. While MOKE has been observed in some antiferromagnets (AFMs) with vanishing magnetization, it is often associated with structures whose symmetry is lower than basic collinear, bipartite order. In contrast, theory predicts a mechanism for MOKE intrinsic to all AFMs of A-type, i.e. layered AFMs in which ferromagnetic layers are antiferromagnetically aligned. Here we report the first experimental confirmation of this mechanism. We achieve this by measuring the imaginary component of MOKE as a function of photon energy in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an A-type AFM where $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved in combination with a translation. By comparing the experimental results with model calculations, we demonstrate that observable MOKE should be expected in all collinear A-type AFMs with out-of-plane spin order, thus enabling optical detection of AFM domains and expanding the scope of MOKE to few-layer AFMs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Skliannyi, Yuval Oreg, Ady Stern</p>
            <p>We propose a way to generate a one-dimensional topological superconductor from a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a Bernal-stacked bilayer of graphene under a displacement field. With proper gating, this structure may be tuned to form three parallel pads of superconductors creating two planar Josephson junctions in series, in which normal regions separate the superconductors. Two characteristics of the system which are essential for our discussion are spin orbit coupling induced by the transition metal dichalcogenides and the variation of the Fermi velocities along the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that these two characteristics lead to one-dimensional topological superconductivity occupying large parts in the parameter space defined by the two phase differences across the two junctions and the relative angle between the junctions and the lattice. An angle-shaped device in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning, can lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial phases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully designed devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show that Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum. Our analysis shows that the transition to a gapped topological state is a result of the band inversion of Andreev states.</p>

            <p>High-speed, non-volatile tunability is critical for advancing reconfigurable photonic devices used in neuromorphic information processing, sensing, and communication. Despite significant progress in developing phase change and ferroelectric materials, achieving highly efficient, reversible, rapid switching of optical properties has remained a challenge. Recently, sliding ferroelectricity has been discovered in 2D semiconductors, which also host strong excitonic effects. Here, we demonstrate that these materials enable nanosecond ferroelectric switching in the complex refractive index, largely impacting their linear optical responses. The maximum index modulation reaches about 4, resulting in a relative reflectance change exceeding 85%. Both on and off switching occurs within 2.5 nanoseconds, with switching energy at femtojoule levels. The switching mechanism is driven by tuning the excitonic peak splitting of a rhombohedral molybdenum disulfide bilayer in an engineered Coulomb screening environment. This new switching mechanism establishes a new direction for developing high-speed, non-volatile optical memories and highly efficient, compact reconfigurable photonic devices. Additionally, the demonstrated imaging technique offers a rapid method to characterize domains and domain walls in 2D semiconductors with rhombohedral stacking.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Simon</p>
            <p>We investigate aspects of the relation between the quantum geometry of the normal state (NS) and the superconducting phase, through the lens of non-locality. By relating band theory to quantum estimation theory, we derive a direct momentum-dependent relation between quantum geometry and the quantum fluctuations of the position operator. We then investigate two effects of the NS quantum geometry on superconductivity. On the one hand, we present a physical interpretation of the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid weight in terms of two different movements of the normal state charge carriers forming the Cooper pairs. The first contribution stems from their center-of-mass motion while the second stems from their zero-point motion, thereby explaining its persistence in flat-band systems. On the other hand, we phenomenologically derive an emergent Darwin term driven by the NS quantum metric. We show its form in one and two-body problems, derive the effective pairing potential in $s$-wave superconductors, and explicit its form in the case of two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. We thus show that the NS quantum metric screens the pairing interaction and weakens superconductivity, which could be tested experimentally by doping a superconductor. Our work reveals the ambivalent relationship between non-interacting quantum geometry and superconductivity, and possibly in other correlated phases.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, the quest for non-Abelian anyons is attracting tremendous attention. In particular, a Majorana quasiparticle has attracted great interest since the non-Abelian anyon is a key particle for topological quantum computation. Much effort has been paid for the quest of the Majorana state in solids, and some candidate material platforms are reported. Among various materials that can host the Majorana state, chiral p-wave superconductor is one of the suitable materials and the iron-based layered superconductor FeTeSe is one of the promising material platforms because its surface can host effective p-wave superconducting state that is analogous to chiral p-wave superconducting state thanks to its topological surface state. Given that a chiral p-wave superconductor possesses spin polarization, detecting the spin polarization can be evidence for the chiral p-wave trait, which results in the existence of Majorana excitation. Here, we show successful detection of the spin polarization at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in its superconducting state, where the spin polarization is detected via a potentiometric method. Amplitudes of the spin signal exhibit characteristic dependence for temperature and bias current, suggesting detection of spin polarization of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles.

Resistivity and magnetization measurements confirm the emergence of type-II bulk superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc=4.63 K.

Electron correlation effects are supported by the enhanced Wilson ratios. First-principles calculations reveal hallmark features of kagome band structure, including Dirac points, van Hove singularities, and quasi-flat bands, primarily derived from the Os d orbitals. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling opens a gap at the Dirac points, significantly altering the electronic properties. Furthermore, the superconductivity and electronic properties of isomorphic compounds are discussed. This work provides a thorough exploration of the superconducting and normal states of LuOs3B2, deepening the understanding of kagome superconductors.</p>

            <p>Using Density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, spin-dependent electron transport in Fe/MoxCr1-xS2/Fe magnetic tunnel junction is studied. Spin-transport for different thicknesses (1, 3, 5, and 7 layers) of the spacer MoS2 and for two different surface orientations of the Fe electrode, the Fe(001) and Fe(111) surface and the effect of substitutional doping of magnetic impurity Cr on the spin-transport of the junctions is investigated. The electronic structure of the heterostructure shows presence of metal induced states in the semiconducting MoS2 at the Fe/MoS2 interface and the effect of the interface is limited to the first two layers of MoS2 from the interface. The I-V characteristics of the junctions for the monolayer and three-layer MoS2 spacer show linear behaviour due to the metallic nature of the junction. The tunneling nature of the junction is observed for the thicker junctions with five-layer and seven-layer spacers. With the introduction of magnetic impurity, we have shown that spin-polarisation in the spacer is improved, thus increasing the spin-polarised current. The Cr-defect states are observed below the conduction band and the Cr-doped devices are stable up to a bias of 0.5V. The close packed Fe(111) surface is better electrode material for tunneling of electrons through the junction compared to the Fe(001) surface due to lower surface energy and reduced transmission.</p>

We compute the transition probabilities and geometric phase differences accounting for the full many-body dynamics and show that qubit states can be read out by fusing the vortex core MZMs and measuring the resulting charge density. We visualize the gate processes using the time- and energy-dependent non-equilibrium local density of states.

            <p>Many-body phenomena in quantum materials emerge from the interplay among a broad continuum of electronic states, and controlling these interactions is critical for engineering novel phases. One promising approach exploits fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field confined within optical cavities to tailor electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that cavity photons can mediate attractive interactions in a tunable van der Waals material and reorganize a continuum of electron-hole transitions into an exciton-like state. We introduce a broadband, sub-wavelength time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated two-dimensional quantum materials into a terahertz cavity. This approach enables the first-ever measurement of the field-tunable bandgap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while revealing ultrastrong coupling with a vacuum Rabi frequency exceeding $\Omega_{Rabi}/\omega\approx 40\%$ of the bare photon energy. Crucially, we identify a novel cavity-induced resonance emerging from the interband continuum that resembles Coulomb-bound excitons and remains stable across a broad temperature range. By uniting longstanding theoretical predictions with advanced experimental techniques, our findings open new avenues for designing and probing unique light-matter states and realizing hybrid correlated phases in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Spin-to-charge conversion in orthorhombic RhSi topological semimetal crystalline thin films</h2>

            <p>The rise of non-magnetic topological semimetals, which provide a promising platform for observing and controlling various spin-orbit effects, has led to significant advancements in the field of topological spintronics. RhSi exists in two distinct polymorphs: cubic and orthorhombic crystal structures. The noncentrosymmetric B20 cubic structure has been extensively studied for hosting unconventional multifold fermions. In contrast, the orthorhombic structure, which crystallizes in the Pnma space group (No. 62), remains less explored and belongs to the family of topological Dirac semimetals. In this work, we investigate the structural, magnetic, and electrical properties of RhSi textured-epitaxial films grown on Si(111) substrates, which crystallize in the orthorhombic structure. We investigate the efficiency of pure spin current transport across RhSi/permalloy interfaces and the subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion via inverse spin Hall effect measurements. The xperimentally determined spin Hall conductivity in orthorhombic RhSi reaches a maximum value of 126 ($\hbar$/e)($\Omega$.cm)$^{-1}$ at 10 K, which aligns reasonably well with first-principles calculations that attribute the spin Hall effect in RhSi to the spin Berry curvature mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a sizable spin-mixing conductance (34.7 nm$^{-2}$) and an exceptionally high interfacial spin transparency of 88$%$ in this heterostructure, underlining its potential for spin-orbit torque switching applications. Overall, this study broadens the scope of topological spintronics, emphasizing the controlled interfacial spin-transport processes and subsequent spin-to-charge conversion in a previously unexplored topological Dirac semimetal RhSi/ferromagnet heterostructure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Qiang Gao, Taige Wang, Dung-Hai Lee</p>
            <p>In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.</p>

            <h2>Multimagnon and multispinon $L_3$-edge RIXS spectra of an effective $\tilde{J}_1-\tilde{J}_2-\tilde{J}_3$ square lattice Heisenberg model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-Yuan Qi, Shangjian Jin, Trinanjan Datta, Dao-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>We investigate the multimagnon and the multispinon $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of a spin-1/2 effective $\tilde{J}_1-\tilde{J}_2-\tilde{J}_3$ square lattice Heisenberg model in its N√©el ordered phase. Motivated by the observation of satellite intensity peaks above the single magnon dispersion in the $L$-edge RIXS spectrum, we propose a resonating valence bond (RVB) inspired RIXS mechanism that incorporates the local site ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) expansion. We compute the multimagnon and the multispinon excitations using $\mathcal{O}(1/S)$ interacting spin wave theory and Schwinger boson mean-field theory (SBMFT) formalism, respectively. We treat the x-ray scattering process up to second order in the UCL expansion. Our calculations of two-magnon, bimagnon, and three-magnon RIXS intensities reveal that interacting spin wave theory fails to fully capture all the quantum correlations in the antiferromagnetic ordered phase. However utilizing the SBMFT framework, with a ground state that combines N√©el order and fluctuating RVB components, we demonstrate that a RIXS bond-flipping mechanism provides an alternative deeper physical explanation of the satellite intensities. Specifically, we find that the spin correlation spectra predicted by the fluctuating RVB mechanism aligns with higher order UCL expansion results. We further show that the satellite intensity above the single-magnon mode can originate both from a one-to-three-magnon hybridization vertex process and from condensed spinons exhibiting Higgs mechanism. These features reflect the interplay of quantum fluctuation, entanglement, and gauge interaction effects of quantum magnetism probed by RIXS.</p>

            <p>Optical vortex beams are a type of topological light characterized by their inherent orbital angular momentum, leading to the propagation of a spiral-shaped wavefront. In this study, we focus on two-dimensional electrons with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions and examine how they respond to pulsed vortex beams in the terahertz frequency band. Spin-orbital interactions play a vital role in transferring the orbital angular momentum of light to electron systems and generating spatiotemporal spin textures. We show that the spatiotemporal spin polarization of electrons reflects orbital angular momentum carried by optical vortex pulses. These findings demonstrate how optical vortices facilitate ultrafast spin manipulation in spin-orbit-coupled electrons. Our results can be straightforwardly extended to the case of higher-frequency vortex beams for other two-dimensional metals with a larger Fermi energy.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic Spin Nernst Effect and Chiral Edge Modes in van der Waals Ferromagnetic Insulators: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vs. Kitaev Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Verena Brehm, Pawe≈Ç Sobieszczyk, Alireza Qaiumzadeh</p>
            <p>The thermomagnetic Nernst effect and chiral edge states are key signatures of nontrivial topology and emerging Berry curvature in magnonic systems. Implementing atomistic spin simulations, we theoretically demonstrate the emergence of chiral magnon edge states at the boundaries of a ferromagnetic hexagonal lattice in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Kitaev interactions, which are robust against nonlinear magnon interactions. In our simulations, we consider the spin parameters of CrI$_3$ as a prototype of van der Waals magnetic layers. We show that the spin accumulation is reduced in the presence of Kitaev spin interactions compared to systems governed by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This reduction stems from the breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry, which leads to a shorter spin coherence length imposed by the Kitaev interaction. We propose that measuring the angular dependence of the Nernst signal in a magnetic field provides an effective indirect method for identifying the microscopic origin of topological magnons. Our findings hold promising potential for advancing next-generation energy-harvesting Nernst materials and facilitating the integration of topological magnetic materials with spintronic-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport theory for unconventional magnets: Interplay of altermagnetism and p-wave magnetism with superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Kokkeler, Ilya Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret</p>
            <p>We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature Via the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates</h2>

            <p>This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Arrufat-Vicente, David Mukamel, Stefano Ruffo, Nicolo Defenu</p>
            <p>Ensemble inequivalence occurs when a systems thermodynamic properties vary depending on the statistical ensemble used to describe it. This phenomenon is known to happen in systems with long-range interactions and has been observed in many classical systems. In this study, we provide a detailed analysis of a long-range quantum ferromagnet spin model that exhibits ensemble inequivalence. At zero temperature ($T = 0$), the microcanonical phase diagram matches that of the canonical ensemble. However, the two ensembles yield different phase diagrams at finite temperatures. This behavior contrasts with the conventional understanding in statistical mechanics of systems with short-range interactions, where thermodynamic properties are expected to align across different ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. We discuss the implications of these findings for synthetic quantum long-range platforms, such as atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duy-Nhat Ly, Dai-Nam Le, Dang-Khoa D. Le, Van-Hoang Le</p>
            <p>We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for determining material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium using experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach is based on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{√∂}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends only on a single material parameter, $\mu$. Therefore, the fitting method is easy to implement, as it compares calculated magnetoexciton energies with experimental data to determine the true exciton reduced mass, the best-fit value of $\mu$. By applying this method, we extract material parameters $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$ from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs (WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$) encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. Additionally, we provide key material properties such as diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii, which are calculated using the extracted parameters.</p>

            <h2>Bulk photogalvanic current control and gap spectroscopy in 2D hexagonal materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Galler, Ofer Neufeld</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials have been intensively explored for multiple optoelectronic applications such as spin current generation, all-optical valleytronics, and topological electronics. In the realm of strong-field and ultrafast light-driven phenomena, it was shown that tailored laser driving such as polychromatic or few-cycle pulses can drive robust bulk photogalvanic (BPG) currents originating from the K/K' valleys. We here explore the BPG effect in 2D systems in the strong-field regime and show that monochromatic elliptical pulses also generically generate such photocurrents. The resultant photocurrents exhibit both parallel and transverse (Hall-like) components, both highly sensitive to the laser parameters, providing photocurrent control knobs. Interestingly, we show that the photocurrent amplitude has a distinct behavior vs. the driving ellipticity that can be indicative of material properties such as the gap size at K/K', which should prove useful for novel forms of BPG-based spectroscopies. We demonstrate these effects also in benchmark ab-initio simulations in monolayer hexagonal boron-nitride. Our work establishes new paths for controlling photocurrent responses in 2D systems that can also be used for multi-dimensional spectroscopy of ultrafast material properties through photocurrent measurements.</p>

            <p>This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.</p>

            <p>We report a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the Ruddlesden-Popper layered nickelates La$_{m+1}$Ni$_m$O$_{3m+1}$ ($m = 1$ to 6) under pressure. Our results suggest that, while these Ruddlesden-Popper layered nickelates display many similarities, they also show noticeable differences. The Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals display bonding-antibonding, or bonding-antibonding-nonbonding, characteristic splittings, depending on the even or odd number of stacking layers $m$. In addition, the ratio of the in-plane interorbital hopping between $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and in-plane intraorbital hopping between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals was found to be large in La$_{m+1}$Ni$_m$O$_{3m+1}$ ($m = 1$ to 6), and this ratio increases from $m = 1$ to $m = 6$, suggesting that the in-plane hybridization will increase as the layer number $m$ increases. In contrast to the dominant $s^\pm$--wave state driven by spin fluctuations in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, two nearly degenerate $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and $s^\pm$-wave leading states were obtained in the four-layer stacking La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and five-layer stacking La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$. The leading $s^\pm$-wave state was recovered in the six-layer material La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$. In general, at the level of the random phase approximation treatment, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ decreases in stoichiometric bulk systems from the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to the six-layer La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, despite the $m$ dependent dominant pairing. Both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic correlations are found to be quite complex. Within the in-plane direction, we obtained the peak of the magnetic susceptibility at ${\bf q} = (0.6 \pi, 0.6 \pi)$ for La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, and at ${\bf q} = (0.7 \pi, 0.7 \pi)$ for La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$.</p>

Consequently, we demonstrate that the tomographic spectrum reflects the existence of mixed-regions of chaos and quasi-regular motion in phase-space. This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional ``level statistics" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates. In this context, we associate with each eigenstate a Higgs measure for the identification of amplitude modes of the order-parameter. Finally we focus on the formation of the lowest Goldstone and Higgs bands.</p>

Numerical simulations, such as exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, matrix product states, and Monte Carlo methods, are essential to examine the properties of strongly correlated systems. Recently, density functional theory (DFT) has been employed in this field within the framework of composite fermion (CF) theory. In this paper, we assess how DFT addresses major challenges in FQH system, such as computing ground state and low-energy excitations. We emphasize the critical insights provided by DFT-based methods into the CF model, edge effects, and the nature of fractional charge and magnetoroton excitations. Furthermore, we examine the advantages and limitations of DFT approaches, highlight the interplay between numerical simulations and theoretical models. We finally discuss the future potential of time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) for modeling non-equilibrium dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional magnetism in spin-orbit coupled systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Keng Yuan, Zhiming Pan, Congjun Wu</p>
            <p>``Unconventional magnetism" was proposed to describe the exotic states arising from Landau-Pomeranchuk instabilities in the spin channel nearly two decades ago. Its odd-partial-wave-channel (e.g. $p$-wave) states break parity giving rise to the dynamic generation of spin-orbit coupling, while its even-partial-wave-channel (e.g. $d$-wave) states break time-reversal symmetry. Both types of states can exhibit collinear and non-collinear spin configurations over Fermi surfaces with the former and latter termed as the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-phases, respectively. The collinear states in even partial-wave channels are in the same symmetry class of ``altermagnetism". In this work, we investigate unconventional magnetism in both $p$- and $d$-wave channels within spin-orbit coupled systems with parity and time-reversal symmetries maintained. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis, the $p$-wave channel yields the gyrotropic, Rashba, Dresselhaus-type spin-orbit couplings. They compete and mix evolving from the $\beta$-phase to the $\alpha$-phase with various types of spin-momentum lockings. Analyses are performed in parallel for the $d$-wave unconventional magnetism. We emphasize that the single-particle dispersion is not sufficient to justify the spin-group type symmetry of the full Hamiltonian. Furthermore, Goldstone manifolds and excitations are examined in each unconventional magnetic phase.</p>

            <h2>Non-Equilibrium Probing of Topological Supersolids in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Dipolar Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Biao Dong, Xiao-Fei Zhang, Wei Han, Renyuan Liao, Xue-Ying Yang, Wu-Ming Liu, Yong-Chang Zhang</p>
            <p>A chiral supersolid is a quantum phase that simultaneously exhibits crystalline order, superfluidity, and topological spin texture, with spontaneously broken translational, U(1) gauge, and chiral symmetries. Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Wang, Haowei Chen, Yu Pang, Xiaolong Zou, Wenhui Duan</p>
            <p>The introduction of intrinsic magnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors offers great opportunities for investigating correlated excitonic phenomena. Here, we employ full-spinor GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation methodology to reveal rich exciton physics in a prototypical 2D N√©el-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnPS$_3$, enabled by the interplay among inverted dispersion of the second valence band, spin-valley coupling and magnetic order. The negative hole mass increases the reduced mass of the lowest-energy bright exciton, leading to exchange splitting enhancement of the bright exciton relative to band-edge dark exciton. Notably, such splitting couples with spontaneous valley polarization to generate distinct excitonic fine structure between $K$ and $-K$ valleys, which dictate distinct relaxation behaviors. Crucially, magnetic order transition from N√©el antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic state induces significant quasiparticle band structure reconstruction and excitonic transitions modification, with low-energy optical excitations being exclusively contributed by majority-spin channel. These findings establish 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductors as an intriguing platform to study band-spin-valley coupled exciton physics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically explore Floquet engineering in few-layer black phosphorus (fBP) under time-periodic driving. Motivated by the ability of circularly polarized light to induce nontrivial topological states at Dirac nodes, we investigate the emergence of a photoinduced DC Hall effect in the Dirac semimetal phase of fBP. Starting from a low-energy continuum model, we derive the effective Floquet Hamiltonian and analytically calculate the Berry curvature, demonstrating the opening of a topological gap. We also perform lattice-model calculations incorporating a self-consistent Hartree method to compute Floquet band structures and DC Hall conductivity under a perpendicular electric field. Our results reveal that the DC Hall current in fBP can be effectively tuned via a periodic driving field and electrostatic gating.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E.F. Talantsev, Yu.V. Blinova, A.V. Korolev</p>
            <p>The discovery of near-room-temperature superconductivity in H3S sparked experimental and theoretical studies of highly compressed hydrides with the aim of obtaining room-temperature superconductivity. There are two dominant hydride classes where the search is ongoing: the first class is the covalently bonded hydrides (which is represented by H3S), and the second class is the clathrate-type hydrides (which is represented by LaH10, YH6, CaH6). Recently, the third class of superconducting hydrides, where the hydrogen remains its molecular form, has been discovered. This class is represented by BaH12 and BiH4. Here, we analyzed experimental data for the BaH12 and BiH4. We found that the BaH12 exhibits grains of an average size of 26 nm and a low level of microstrain 0.1%, in the range of 126 GPa < P < 160 GPa. We also derived the Debye $\Theta_D$ and Einstein $\Theta_E$ temperatures, and the electron-phonon coupling constant $\Lambda_{e-ph} $ in BaH12 and BiH4. The $\Lambda_{e-ph} $ in BiH4 significantly differs from the values obtained by first-principles calculations. The derived Fermi temperature $T_F = 20,000 K$ for BiH4 positions this molecular hydride between the unconventional and conventional superconductors bands in the Uemura plot. This position is outside of the band where covalently bonded and clathrate hydrides are located. The ratio $\Theta_D / T_F = 0.026 $ of BiH4 is typical for pure metals and A-15 alloys. This implies that the BiH4, is the first hydride superconductor which complains with the Migdal's theorem.</p>

            <h2>Fickian Yet non-Gaussian Diffusion in Complex Molecular Fluids via a non-local diffusion framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. Srinivasan, V. K. Sharma, S. Mitra</p>
            <p>Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (FnGD) has gained popularity in the recent times owing to it's ubiquity in a variety of complex fluids. However, whether FnGD can be observed experimentally in molecular fuids is still obscure with very little study in real systems. In this letter, we show existence of FnGD in molecular fluids based on compelling evidence from incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (IQENS). Using a cage-jump diffsion model, we show that while the approach to Fickianity is exponentially fast, the Gaussianity is restored at a much slower algebraic rate. We propose a non-local diffusion (NLD) model to describe a d-dimensional jump-diffusion in FnGD regime and show their universal applicability in such systems. This study establishes that cage-jump diffusion process inevitably lead to FnGD and provides the framework of NLD models to explore such diffusion phenomena in any arbitrary dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Extending Collinear Density Functionals to Noncollinear Cases under Periodic Boundary Condition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyu Zhang, Taoni Bao</p>
            <p>Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism in materials requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a methodology was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones, successfully defining noncollinear functionals and their derivatives. However, the initial implementation involved a systematic approach to differentiate energy over density matrix elements rather than the derivatives of the energy functional with respect to density, presenting challenges for integration with periodic boundary condition-density functional theory (PBC-DFT) software. We have derived a novel set of working equations based on the original methodology, which provides noncollinear energy functionals and their derivatives. These working equations have been implemented in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, ensuring numerical stability and transferability without the need for incorporating derivatives of basis functions. This implementation is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. We demonstrate some preliminary applications in periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials, using NCXC.</p>

            <h2>Predicting Methane Adsorption in Metal-Substituted MOFs: A Comparative Study between Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karim Aljamal, Xiao Wang</p>
            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for methane capture due to their high surface area and tunable properties. Metal substitution represents a powerful strategy to enhance MOF performance, yet systematic exploration of the vast chemical space remains challenging. In this work, we compare density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) in predicting methane adsorption properties in metal-substituted variants of three high-performing MOFs: M-HKUST-1, M-ATC, and M-ZIF-8 (M = Cu, Zn). DFT calculations reveal significant differences in methane binding energetics between Cu and Zn variants of all three MOFs. On the other hand, we fine-tuned a pretrained multimodal ML model, PMTransformer, on a curated subset of hypothetical MOF (hMOF) structures to predict macroscopic adsorption properties. While the model qualitatively predicts adsorption properties for the original unaltered MOFs, it fails to distinguish between metal variants despite their different binding energetics identified by DFT. We trace this limitation to the hMOF training data generated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on classical force fields (UFF/TraPPE). Our study highlights a key challenge in ML-based MOF screening: ML models inherit the limitations of their training data, particularly when electronic effects significantly impact adsorption behavior. Our findings emphasize the need for improved force fields or hybrid GCMC/DFT datasets to incorporate both geometric and electronic factors for accurate prediction of adsorption properties in metal-substituted MOFs.</p>

            <p>The heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ ($T_{\textrm{c}} = 0.35\, \textrm{K}$) shows two superconducting (SC) phases, SC1 and SC2, when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the $c$ axis of the tetragonal unit cell. All experiments to date indicate that the change in SC order parameter detected at $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H^{*} \approx 4\, \textrm{T}$ is due to strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling at the Ce sites caused by the locally non-centrosymmetric environments of the otherwise globally centrosymmetric crystalline structure. Another phase (phase I) exists in this material below $T_{\textrm{0}} = 0.54\, \textrm{K}$. In a previous specific heat study [K. Semeniuk et al. Phys. Rev. B, $107$, L220504 (2023)] we have shown that phase I persists up to a field $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H_{0} \approx 6\, \textrm{T}$, larger than $H^{*}$. From thermodynamic arguments we expected the phase-I boundary line to cross phase SC2 at a tetracritical point. However, we could not find any signature of the phase-I line inside the SC2 phase and speculated that this was due to the fact that the $T_{0}(H)$ line is almost perpendicular to the $H$ axis and, therefore, invisible to $T$-dependent measurements. This would imply a weak competition between the two order parameters. Here, we report magnetic field dependent measurements of the magnetostriction and ac-susceptibility on high-quality single crystals. We see clear evidence of the singularity at $H_{0}$ inside the SC2 phase and confirm our previous prediction. Furthermore, we observe the transition across the $T^{*}(H)$ line in $T$-dependent specific heat measurements, which show that the $T^{*}(H)$ line is not perpendicular to the field axis, but has a positive slope. Our work supports recent $\mu$SR results which suggest coexistence of phase I with superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We investigate magnetic properties of the $s$ = 1/2 compound K$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$(MoO$_{4}$)$_{4}$ by combining magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, specific heat, and electron spin resonance (ESR) with density functional calculations. Its monoclinic structure features alternating Cu$^{2+}$ ($s$ = 1/2) monomers and edge-shared dimers linked by MoO$_{4}$ units, forming a distorted diamond chain along the $a$-axis. Antiferromagnetic order occurs at $T_{\rm N}$ = 2.3 K, as evident from a $\lambda$-type anomaly in specific heat and magnetic susceptibility derivatives. Inverse magnetic susceptibility reveals coexisting ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions. Specific heat and ESR data show two characteristic temperatures: one at 20 K, associated with spin-singlet formation in Cu$_{2}$O$_{9}$ dimers, and another at 3.68 K, indicating short-range correlations between dimers and monomers. Magnetization measurements reveal a metamagnetic transition at 2.6 T and a critical magnetic field $\mu_{0}H_{c}$ = 3.4 T, where a 1/3 magnetization plateau emerges with saturation near 0.35 $\mu_{\rm B}$. Low-temperature specific heat and magnetization data reveal the suppression of long-range order at $\mu_{0}H_{c}$, enabling the construction of a temperature-magnetic field phase diagram showing multiple magnetic phases near the $\mu_{0}H_{c}$. Density functional theory confirms a distorted diamond chain with $J_{1}$ dimers and competing $J_2$, $J_4$, $J_3$, and $J_5$ interactions with monomer spins as an effective low-temperature spin model.</p>

            <p>Thermoelectric materials allow the direct conversion of waste heat into electricity, and novel materials are being investigated for this purpose. Recently, doped Bi$_2$O$_2$Se has shown high application potential. In this study, we discuss causes for large variation in reported transport properties of pure Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and present a preparation method that improves the reproducibility of undoped polycrystalline samples and improves their stability under thermal cycling. Key steps of this method include calcination of the Bi$_2$O$_3$ precursor, purification of the synthesized material in a temperature gradient, use of a coarse particle fraction and compaction of the powders in a Si3N4 die instead of a graphite die. The resulting polycrystalline material exhibits improved reproducibility and enhanced resistance to thermal cycling. It has room temperature electrical conductivity {\sigma}RT ~ 500 S.m-1 and Seebeck coefficient S ~ -300 $\mu$V.K$^{-1}$. These properties make it suitable as a reference material for future doping studies. The presented synthesis approach may provide a more reliable platform for investigating the intrinsic behavior and doping response of Bi$_2$O$_2$Se in thermoelectric applications.</p>

            <p>Utilizing the framework of matrix product states, we investigate gauging as a method for exploring quantum phases of matter. Specifically, we describe how symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases in one-dimensional spin systems behave under twisted gauging, a generalization of the well-known gauging procedure for globally symmetric states. Compared to previous, order parameter--based, approaches our analysis is not limited to the case of maximally non-commutative (MNC) phases and we use our findings to propose a generalization of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation to the non-MNC setting. A key result of our work is that gauging produces configurations characterized by a combination of MNC order and symmetry breaking, when applied to non-MNC SPT phases. More generally, we conjecture a precise correspondence between SSB and non-MNC SPT phases, possibly enabling the detection of such phases using local and string order parameters.</p>

Here, we report the development of BOlometric Superconducting Optical Nanoscopy (BOSON), a novel platform that integrates bolometric detection at the superconducting transition edges with near-field optical techniques. BOSON enables the mapping of photoinduced changes in superconductivity with unprecedented spatial resolution and photon sensitivity. By incorporating BOSON with low-dimensional materials, we achieved polariton imaging at nanowatt excitation levels--at least four orders of magnitude lower than the power typically required in prior near-field nanoscopy experiments. Our findings highlight the potential for BOSON to advance scanning probe based optical platforms to enable the detection of photons, polaritons, and Cooper pair dynamics at the nanoscale.

            <p>We theoretically explore the low-energy behavior of a Josephson tunnel junction coupled to a finite-length, charge-biased transmission line and compare it to its flux-biased counterpart. For transmission lines of increasing length, we show that the low-energy charge-dependent energy bands of the charge-biased configuration can be exactly mapped onto those of the flux-biased system via a well-defined duality transformation of circuit parameters. In the limit of an infinitely long transmission line, the influence of boundary conditions vanishes, and both circuits reduce to a resistively shunted Josephson junction. This convergence reveals the system's intrinsic self-duality and critical behavior. Our exact formulation of charge-flux duality provides a foundation for generalizations to more complex superconductor-insulator phase transitions.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected to a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely unentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively. Our findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and could be of relevance to black hole physics.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</p>

            <p>Predicting the kinetics of drug-protein interactions is crucial for understanding drug efficacy, particularly in personalized medicine, where protein mutations can significantly alter drug residence times. This study applies Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS) and its Partial Path variant (REPPTIS) to investigate the dissociation kinetics of imatinib from Abelson nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) and mutants relevant to chronic myeloid leukemia therapy. These path-sampling methods offer a bias-free alternative to conventional approaches requiring qualitative predefined reaction coordinates. Nevertheless, the complex free-energy landscape of ABL-imatinib dissociation presents significant challenges. Multiple metastable states and orthogonal barriers lead to parallel unbinding pathways, complicating convergence in TIS-based methods. Despite employing computational efficiency strategies such as asynchronous replica exchange, full convergence remained elusive. This work provides a critical assessment of path sampling in high-dimensional biological systems, discussing the need for enhanced initialization strategies, advanced Monte Carlo path generation moves, and machine learning-derived reaction coordinates to improve kinetic predictions of drug dissociation with minimal prior knowledge.</p>

            <p>The traditional techniques for extracting polycrystalline grain structures from microscopy images, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), are labour-intensive, subjective, and time-consuming, limiting their scalability for high-throughput analysis.

Due to the limited availability of adequate images preventing the training of deep machine learning models, a new seven-stage methodology is employed to generate synthetic TEM images for training. This concept-oriented synthetic data approach can be extended to any field of interest where the scarcity of data is a challenge. The presented model was applied to various metals with average grain sizes down to the nanoscale, producing grain morphologies from low-resolution TEM images that are comparable to those obtained from advanced and demanding experimental techniques with an average accuracy of 97.23%.</p>

Our approach was applied to the stopping power of helium ions in gold thin films, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference models such as SRIM and ICRU-49. The results reveal that carefully chosen measurement angles can effectively balance statistical precision and systematic accuracy, achieving total uncertainties below 3% across a wide energy range.

            <p>If the behavior of a system with many degrees of freedom can be captured by a small number of collective variables, then plausibly there is an underlying mean-field theory. We show that simple versions of this idea fail to describe the patterns of activity in networks of real neurons. An extended mean-field theory that matches the distribution of collective variables is at least consistent, though shows signs that these networks are poised near a critical point, in agreement with other observations. These results suggest a path to analysis of emerging data on ever larger numbers of neurons.</p>

            <h2>Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya Banerjee</p>
            <p>The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point, from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</p>

            <h2>Rydberg Atoms in a Ladder Geometry: Quench Dynamics and Floquet Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mainak Pal, Tista Banerjee</p>
            <p>In recent days, Rydberg atom quantum simulator platforms have emerged as novel quantum simulators for physical systems ranging from condensed matter to particle physics. On a fundamental level, these platforms allow for a direct test of our understanding of the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics starting from the laws of quantum dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the fate of quantum dynamics in a model of Rydberg atoms arranged in a square ladder geometry, with a Rabi frequency $2\Omega$ and a detuning profile which is staggered along the longer direction with amplitude $\Delta$. As the staggering strength $\Delta$ is tuned from $\Delta/\Omega=0\rightarrow\infty$, the model exhibits a wide class of dynamical phenomena, ranging from (i) quantum many-body scars (QMBS) ($\Delta/\Omega \sim 0,1$), (ii) integrability induced slow dynamics and approximate Krylov fractures ($\Delta/\Omega \gg 1$) . Additionally, by leveraging the underlying chiral nature of the spectrum of this model Hamiltonian, it is possible to design Floquet protocols leading to dynamical signatures reminiscent of discrete time-crystalline order and exact Floquet flat bands. Finally, we study the robustness of these dynamical features against imperfections in the implementation of the Floquet protocols, long-range van der Waals interactions and inevitable influences from the environment in the form of pure dephasing and the finite lifetime of the Rydberg excited state.</p>

            <p>We examine the spectral properties of a recently proposed theory of the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of the cuprates. We show that this theory can be obtained from the familiar paramagnon theory of nearly antiferromagnetic metals by fractionalizing the paramagnon into two `hidden' layers of S=1/2 spins. The first hidden layer of spins hybridizes with the electrons as in a Kondo lattice heavy Fermi liquid, while the second hidden layer of spins forms a spin liquid with fractionalized spinon excitations. We compute the imaginary part of the electronic self energy induced by the spinon excitations. The energy and momentum dependence of the photoemission spectrum across the Brillouin zone provides a good match to observations by He et al. in Bi2201 (Science 331, 1579 (2011)) and by Chen et al. in Bi2212 (Science 366, 1099 (2019)).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiren Zhu, Sawyer Remillard, Bachir A. Abeid, Danila Frolkin, Spencer H. Bryngelson, Jin Yang, Mauro Rodriguez Jr., Jonathan B. Estrada</p>
            <p>The rapid and accurate characterization of soft, viscoelastic materials at high strain rates is of interest in biological and engineering applications. Examples include assessing the extent of tissue ablation during histotripsy procedures and developing injury criteria for the mitigation of blast injuries. The inertial microcavitation rheometry technique (IMR, Estrada et al., 2018) allows for the characterization of local viscoelastic properties at strain rates up to 1E8 per second. However, IMR now typically relies on bright-field videography of a sufficiently translucent sample at >1 million frames per second and a simulation-dependent fit optimization process that can require hours of post-processing. Here, we present an improved IMR-style technique, called parsimonious inertial microcavitation rheometry (pIMR), that parsimoniously characterizes surrounding viscoelastic materials. The pIMR approach uses experimental advancements to estimate the time to first collapse of the laser-induced cavity within approximately 20 ns and a theoretical energy balance analysis that yields an approximate collapse time based on the material viscoelasticity parameters. The pIMR method closely matches the accuracy of the original IMR procedure while decreasing the computational cost from hours to seconds while potentially reducing reliance on ultra-high-speed videography. This technique can enable nearly real-time characterization of soft, viscoelastic hydrogels and biological materials with a numerical criterion assessing the correct choice of model. We illustrate the efficacy of the technique on batches of tens of experiments for both soft hydrogels and fluids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maine Christos, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>We model the pseudogap state of the hole- and electron-doped cuprates as a metal with hole and/or electron pocket Fermi surfaces. In the absence of long-range antiferromagnetism, such Fermi surfaces violate the Luttinger requirement of enclosing the same area as free electrons at the same density. Using the Ancilla theory of such a pseudogap state, we describe the onset of conventional $d$-wave superconductivity by the condensation of a charge e Higgs boson transforming as a fundamental under the emergent SU(2) gauge symmetry of a background $\pi$-flux spin liquid. In all cases, we find that the $d$-wave superconductor has gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points on the Brillouin zone diagonals with significant velocity anisotropy, just as in the BCS state. This includes the case of the electron-doped pseudogap metal with only electron pockets centered at wavevectors $(\pi, 0)$, $(0, \pi)$, and an electronic gap along the zone diagonals. Remarkably, in this case too, gapless nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles emerge within the gap at 4 points along the zone diagonals upon the onset of superconductivity.</p>

            <p>The unexpected discovery of superconductivity and strong electron correlation in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), a system containing only sp electrons, is considered as one of the most intriguing developments in two-dimensional materials in recent years. The key feature is the emergent flat energy bands near the Fermi level, a favorable condition for novel many-body phases, at the so-called "magic angles". The physical origin of these interesting flat bands has been elusive to date, hindering the construction of an effective theory for the unconventional electron correlation. In this work, we have identified the importance of charge accumulation in the AA region of the moire supercell and the most critical role of the Fermi ring in AA-stacked bilayer graphene. We show that the magic angles can be predicted by the moire periodicity determined by the size of this Fermi ring. The resonant criterion in momentum space makes it possible to coherently combine states on the Fermi ring through scattering by the moire potential, leading to flat bands near the Fermi level. We thus establish the physical origin of the magic angles in TBG and identify the characteristics of one-particle states associated with the flat bands for further many-body investigations.</p>

            <p>Inspired by recent advances in observational astrophysics and continued explorations in the field of analog gravity, we discuss the prospect of simulating models of cosmology within the context of synthetic mechanical lattice experiments. We focus on the physics of expanding Universe scenarios described by the Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Specifically, quantizing scalar fluctuations in a background FLRW spacetime leads to a quadratic bosonic Hamiltonian with temporally varying pair production terms. Here we present a mapping that provides a one-to-one correspondence between these classes of cosmology models and feedback-coupled mechanical oscillators. As proof-of-principle, we then perform experiments on a synthetic mechanical lattice composed of such oscillators. We simulate two different FLRW expansion scenarios with Universes dominated by vacuum energy and matter and discuss our experimental results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianwei Yang, Zhao Liu, Ling Wang</p>
            <p>The intricate interplay between frustration and spin chirality has the potential to give rise to unprecedented phases in frustrated quantum magnets. We examine the ground state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 square lattice J1-J2-Jx model by employing critical level crossings and ground state fidelity susceptibility (FS) using exact diagonalization (ED) with full lattice symmetries. Our analysis reveals the evolution of highly symmetric energy levels as a function of J2 at fixed Jx. During a magnetic to non-magnetic phase transition, the precise identification of the phase boundary is achieved through critical level crossings between the gapless excitation of a magnetic phase and the quasi-degenerate ground state of a non-magnet phase. Conversely, a direct transition between two non-magnetic phases is characterized by a FS peak accompanied by an avoided ground state level crossing, serving as a distinctive signal. Within a substantial range of Jx, we identify an anticipated chiral spin liquid (CSL) state and an adjacent nematic spin liquid (NSL) phase with a degeneracy of two on a cylinder. These two phases are demarcated by a nearly vertical boundary line at J2 = 0.65. This critical line terminates at the lower boundary of a magnetic ordered chiral spin solid (CSS) phase. We validate the topological nature of the CSL using the modular S matrix of the minimum entangled states (MES) on a torus, along with the entanglement spectra (ES) of even and odd sectors on a cylinder, employing an SU(2)-symmetric density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. Furthermore, we delve into a comprehensive discussion on the nature of the NSL, exploring aspects such as ground state degeneracy, the local bond energy landscape, and the singlet and triplet gaps on various tori. These analysis provide substantial evidence supporting the nematic nature of the NSL.</p>

            <h2>Memory-induced long-range order in dynamical systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Sipling, Y.-H. Zhang, M. Di Ventra</p>
            <p>Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.</p>

This sample geometry allows not only efficient detection, but also electrical control of the antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe$_2$ electrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic resonance enables detailed studies of the physics governing these high frequency dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiang Gao, Ryan A. Lanzetta, Patrick Ledwith, Jie Wang, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The bootstrap method aims to solve problems by imposing constraints on the space of physical observables, which often follow from physical assumptions such as positivity and symmetry. Here, we employ a bootstrap approach to study interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level by minimizing the energy as a function of the static structure factor subject to a set of constraints, bypassing the need to construct the full many-body wavefunction. This approach rigorously lower bounds the ground state energy, making it complementary to conventional variational upper bounds. We show that the lower bound we obtain is relatively tight, within at most 5\% from the ground state energy computed with exact diagonalization (ED) at small system sizes, and generally gets tighter as we include more constraints. In addition to energetics, our results reproduce the correct power law dependence of the pair correlation function at short distances and the existence of a large entanglement gap in the two-particle entanglement spectra for the Laughlin states at $\nu = 1/3$. We further identify signatures of the composite Fermi liquid state close to half-filling. This shows that the bootstrap approach is capable, in principle, of describing non-trivial gapped topologically ordered, as well as gapless, phases. At the end, we will discuss possible extensions and limitations of this approach. Our work establishes numerical bootstrap as a promising method to study many-body phases in topological bands, paving the way to its application in moir√© platforms where the energetic competition between fractional quantum anomalous Hall, symmetry broken, and gapless states remains poorly understood.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexej Schelle</p>
            <p>The theory of non-interacting Bose gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain symmetry aspects of non-interacting and very weakly interacting Bose gases in the limit of fluctuating particle numbers, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.</p>

            <p>The deformation behavior of single crystal and nanocrystalline nickel were studied using in situ micropillar compression experiments from quasi-static to high strain rates up to 10^3 s-1. Deformation occurred by dislocation slip activity in single crystal nickel whereas extensive grain boundary sliding was observed in nanocrystalline nickel, with a shift towards more inhomogeneous, localized deformation above 1 s-1. The strain rate sensitivity exponent was found to change at higher strain rates for both single crystal and nanocrystalline nickel, while the overall strain rate sensitivity was observed to be of the same value for both. With increasing high strain rate micropillar compression tests being reported, the issue of adiabatic heating in micropillars becomes important. We report crystal plasticity based finite element modeling to estimate the adiabatic heating, spatially resolved within the pillar, at the highest tested strain rates. The simulations predicted a significant temperature rise of up to 200 K in nanocrystalline Ni at the grain boundaries, and 20 K in single crystalline Ni due to strain localization.

The results of our study indicate that the optimal values for U(Cr$_{3d}$) and U(I$_{5p}$) are 3.5 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. This approach is further applied to improve calculations of electronic and magnetic properties in CrI$_3$ monolayers and, more importantly, in bilayers combined with van der Waals functionals. These refinements hold promise for further studies of complex CrI$_3$ nanostructures, and may also be of interest for other trihalide few-layer systems.</p>

            <p>Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.</p>

            <p>We consider unconventional magnets with proximity-induced superconductivity and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets under the influence of spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductivity induced by proximity effect. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as with $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave symmetries. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.</p>

Transition metal compounds as correlated materials provide a versatile platform to engineer the Mott insulating state. Previous studies mostly focused on the controlling of the repulsive interaction and bandwidth of the electrons by gating or doping. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on monolayer 1T phase NbSe2, TaSe2, and TaS2 and directly observed their band structures with characteristic lower Hubbard bands. By systematically investigating the orbital textures and temperature dependence of the energy gap of the materials in this family, we discovered that hybridization of the chalcogen p states with lower Hubbard band stabilizes the Mott phase via tuning of the bandwidth, as shown by a significant increase of the transition temperature (TC) at a stronger hybridization strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism for realizing a robust Mott insulating phase and establish monolayer 1T phase transition metal dichalcogenide family as a promising platform for exploring correlated electron problems.</p>

            <p>LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is of current research interest as a kagome metal with a superconducting transition temperature, $T_c\sim$7 K and higher temperature charge density wave (CDW) orders. Here we report electrical transport and X-ray diffraction measurements on LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ under pressure up to 65 GPa and 35 GPa respectively. The superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ first gets slightly enhanced and reaches a maximum $\sim$8.7 K at $\sim$8.5 GPa. With further applied pressure, $T_c$ is initially gradually suppressed, then more rapidly suppressed, followed by gradual suppression, revealing a superconducting dome. Two possible pressure-induced structural phase transitions are also observed at room temperature, from original hexagonal phase to another hexagonal structure above $\sim$11.5 GPa, and further to a structure with lower symmetry above $\sim$23.5 GPa. These transition pressures roughly correlate with features found in our pressure dependent transport data.</p>

            <p>Several authors have suggested that the surfaces of vanishing potential generated by the electrostatic fields from a distribution of point charges resemble triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) corresponding to the positions of the point charges. We provide a theoretical basis for this phenomenological comparison by starting with the Boltzmann equation to show that the surface corresponding to zero charge density is a minimal surface. We then use density-functional calculations for elemental materials that differ electronically and structurally, Na, Cu, and Al, to show that surfaces of vanishing charge density converge to the corresponding TPMS.</p>

            <h2>Detection of anyon braiding through pump-probe spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu Yang, Ryan Buechele, Nandini Trivedi</p>
            <p>We show that the braiding of anyons in a quantum spin liquid leaves a distinct dynamical signature in the nonlinear pump-probe response. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and matrix product state techniques, we study the nonlinear pump-probe response of the toric code in a magnetic field, a model which hosts mobile electric $e$ and magnetic $m$ anyonic excitations. While the linear response signal oscillates and decays with time like $\sim t^{-1.3}$, the amplitude of the nonlinear signal for $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$ features a linear-in-time enhancement at early times. The comparison between $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$, which involves the non-trivial braiding of $e$ and $m$ anyons, and $\chi^{(3)}_{XXX}$ that involves the trivial braiding of the same types of anyons, serves to distinguish the braiding statistics of anyons. We support our analysis by constructing a hard-core anyon model with statistical gauge fields to develop further insights into the time dependence of the pump-probe response. Pump-probe spectroscopy provides a distinctive new probe of quantum spin liquid states, beyond the inconclusive broad features observed in single spin flip inelastic neutron scattering.</p>

            <p>We explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, employing nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. We discover a novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>We revealed the resistive switching, negative differential resistance and charge accumulation effects in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method and annealed at temperatures from 500¬∞C to 800¬∞C. The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600¬∞C to 800¬∞C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Yuan Cai, Hui-Ke Jin, Yi Zhou</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive study of topological phases in the SO($n$) spin chains using a combination of analytical parton construction and numerical techniques. For even $n=2l$, we identify a novel SPT$^2$ phase characterized by two distinct topological sectors, exhibiting exact degeneracy at the matrix product state (MPS) exactly solvable point. Through Gutzwiller-projected mean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we demonstrate that these sectors remain topologically degenerate in close chains throughout the SPT$^2$ phase, with energy gaps decaying exponentially with system size. For odd $n=2l+1$, we show that the ground state remains unique in close chains. We precisely characterize critical states using entanglement entropy scaling, confirming the central charges predicted by conformal field theories. Our results reveal fundamental differences between even and odd $n$ cases, provide numerical verification of topological protection, and establish reliable methods for studying high-symmetry quantum systems. The Gutzwiller-guided DMRG is demonstrated to be notably efficient in targeting specific topological sectors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiangnan Biguo, Xiaoquan Yu</p>
            <p>We propose a framework for topological soliton dynamics in trapped spinor superfluids, decomposing the force acting on the soliton by the surrounding fluid into the buoyancy force and spin-corrections arising from the density depletion at soliton core and the coupling between the orbital motion and the spin mixing, respectively. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), the spin correction enables mapping the FDS motion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent quartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a single-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a local minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of a type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three regimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic, followed by single-sided oscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes symmetry breaking, transitioning from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where particle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing between two minima via the local maximum, then the motion around one of the two minima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a harmonic oscillator.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation Bounds for the Restricted Solid-on-Solid Model of Surface Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothy Sudijono</p>
            <p>The restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) model is a model of continuous-time surface growth characterized by the constraint that adjacent height differences are bounded by a fixed constant. Though the model is conjectured to belong to the KPZ universality class, mathematical progress on the model is very sparse. We study basic properties of the model and establish bounds on surface height fluctuations as a function of time. A linear fluctuation bound is proven for all dimensions, and a logarithmic fluctuation lower bound is given for dimension one. The proofs rely on a new characterization of RSOS as a type of first passage percolation on a disordered lattice, which is of independent interest. The logarithmic lower bound is established by showing equality in distribution to the minimum of a certain dual RSOS process.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Giacomelli, Cristiano Ciuti</p>
            <p>The physics of a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment is a long-standing fundamental problem at the center of an intense debate, strongly revived by the advent of superconducting platforms with high-impedance multimode resonators. Here we investigate the emergent criticality of a junction coupled to a multimode resonator when the number of modes is increased. We demonstrate how the multimode environment renormalizes the Josephson and capacitive energies of the junction so that in the thermodynamic limit the charging energy dominates when the impedance is larger than the resistance quantum and is negligible otherwise, independently from the bare ratio between the two energy scales and the compact or extended nature of the phase of the junction. Via exact diagonalization, we find that the transition surprisingly stems from a level anticrossing involving not the ground state, but the first excited state, whose energy gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. We clarify the nature of the two phases by pointing at a different behaviour of the ground and excited states and we show that at the transition point the spectrum displays universality not only at low frequencies. In agreement with recent experiments, we reveal striking spectral signatures of the phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics and Geometry of Entanglement in Many-Body Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peyman Azodi, Herschel A Rabitz</p>
            <p>A new framework is formulated to study entanglement dynamics in many-body quantum systems along with an associated geometric description. In this formulation, called the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF), the system's wave function or density matrix is transformed into a new space of complex functions with isolated singularities. Accordingly, entanglement dynamics is encoded in specific residues of the QCTF, and importantly, the explicit evaluation of the system's time dependence is avoided. Notably, the QCTF formulation allows for various algebraic simplifications and approximations to address the normally encountered complications due to the exponential growth of the many-body Hilbert space with the number of bodies. These simplifications are facilitated through considering the \textit{patterns}, in lieu of the elements, lying within the system's state. Consequently, a main finding of this paper is the exterior (Grassmannian) algebraic expression of many-body entanglement as the collective areas of regions in the Hilbert space spanned by pairs of projections of the wave function onto an arbitrary basis. This latter geometric measure is shown to be equivalent to the second-order R√©nyi entropy. Additionally, the geometric description of the QCTF shows that characterizing features of the reduced density matrix can be related to experimentally observable quantities. The QCTF-based geometric description offers the prospect of theoretically revealing aspects of many-body entanglement, by drawing on the vast scope of methods from geometry.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Propagation in Integrable Heisenberg Chains from a New Lens</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peyman Azodi, Herschel A Rabitz</p>
            <p>The exact single-magnon entanglement evolution in Heisenberg chains is obtained using the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF) formulation. A dual, i.e., frequency and time-domain, analysis shows that the transient dynamics of individual spins' entanglement is described via a Bessel function of the first kind. Through QCTF, we bypass the evaluation of the full system's state for the purpose of obtaining entanglement. Although it is known that the observable entanglement edge is formed by the arrival of a stream of quasi-particles that travel with the maximum group velocity, we show how the early quasi-particles travel faster than the maximum group velocity of the chain and contribute to entanglement production. Our results can be extended to the multi-magnon regime, therefore opening up the means to better interpret equilibration dynamics and thermodynamics in Heisenberg chains.</p>

This solution provides a scheme to study non-equilibrium system order by order. Our calculations are performed in generic hydrodynamic frame, and the results can be reduced to a specific hydrodynamic frame by imposing constraints. As a specific example, we analytically calculated the covariant expressions of the particle flow and the energy momentum tensor up to the first order in relaxation time. Finally and most importantly, we present all 14 kinetic coefficients for a neutral system, which are verified to satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relation in a generic hydrodynamic frame and guarantee a non-negative entropy production in the frame where the first order conservation laws are restored.</p>

            <p>A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure and Gaussian with given marginals. In the random constrained symplectic model we then compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound mode-mode entanglement. Modes of frequency much larger than $\frac{k_B T_{H}(t)}{\hbar}$ are not populated at time $t$ and drop out of the analysis. Among the other modes we find that correlations and hence entanglement between relatively thinly populated modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency) to be strongly suppressed. Relatively highly populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless very unlikely to be entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require any significant quantum entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications beyond black hole physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sagar Silva Pratapsi, Sebastian Deffner, Stefano Gherardini</p>
            <p>What is the minimal time until a quantum system can exhibit genuine quantum features? To answer this question we derive quantum speed limits for two-time correlation functions arising from statistics of measurements. Generally, these two-time correlators are described by quasiprobabilities, if the initial quantum state of the system does not commute with the measurement observables. Our quantum speed limits are derived from the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation, and set the minimal time at which a quasiprobability can become non-positive, which is evidence for the onset of non-classical traits in the system dynamics. As an illustrative example, we apply these results to a conditional quantum gate, by determining the optimal condition giving rise to non-classicality at maximum speed. Our analysis also hints at boosted power extraction in genuinely non-classical dynamics.</p>

The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.</p>

            <p>Periodic driving is a powerful tool to generate exotic topological phases without static counterparts, such as the anomalous chiral edge modes from bulk bands with zero Chern number and topological $\pi$ modes exhibiting period-doubled dynamics. Recently, a new class of Floquet topological mode, namely the $\pi/2$ mode, which carries four-period periodicity and has potential applications in quantum computing, was proposed based on a square-root method and realized in an acoustic system. Here we propose a laser-written waveguide array lattice to realize topological $\pi/2$ modes in photonics. Our photonic model simulates a square-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and has a rich phase diagram allowing for the co-existence of conventional zero, $\pi$ modes, and the new $\pi/2$ modes. Through numerical simulations of the wave equation, we uncover the unique four-period evolution feature of the $\pi/2$ modes. Our model, which only contains four waveguides per unit cell and two driving steps, is easy to implement with current fabrication techniques and may find applications in quantum optics.</p>

            <p>Non-equilibrium dynamics of unentangled and entangled pure states in interacting quantum systems is crucial for harnessing quantum information and to understand quantum thermalization. We develop a general Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory for non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states of fermions. We apply our formalism to study the time evolution of initial density inhomogeneity and multi-point correlations of pure states in the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We demonstrate a remarkable universality in the dynamics of pure states in the SYK model. We show that dynamics of almost all pure states in a fixed particle number sector is solely determined by a set of universal large-$N$ Kadanoff-Baym equations. Moreover, irrespective of the initial state the site- and disorder-averaged Green's function thermalizes instantaneously, whereas local and non-local Green's functions have finite thermalization rate. We support our large-$N$ results through random-matrix theory (RMT) analysis. Furthermore, we show that the thermalization of an initial pure product state in the non-interacting SYK$_2$ model is independent of fermion filling and an initial density inhomogeneity decays with weak but long lived oscillations due to dephasing. In contrast, the interacting SYK$_{q\geq 4}$ model thermalizes slower than the non-interacting model and exhibits filling-dependent monotonic relaxation of initial inhomogeneity. For evolution of entangled pure states, we show that the initial entanglement is encoded in the non-local and/or multi-point quantum correlations that relax as the system thermalizes.</p>

            <p>Understanding the dynamical behavior of quasiparticles is essential for uncovering novel quantum many-body phenomena. Among these phenomena, the polaron in ultracold atomic gases has attracted considerable interest due to its precise controllability. By engineering the underlying Hamiltonian, polarons serve as a versatile platform for studying both equilibrium properties and non-equilibrium dynamics. In this work, we investigate the quantum dynamics of strongly driven Bose polarons, where minority atoms are described as mobile impurities with spin-1/2, and majority atoms are bosons. The spin-$\uparrow$ impurity interacts with majority atoms through a tunable scattering length $a$, while the spin-$\downarrow$ impurity remains non-interacting. After turning on the Rabi coupling, we calculate the evolution of the total magnetization using a trial wavefunction. We identify the exhibition of anomalous Rabi oscillation and steady-state magnetization for $a>0$, due to the interplay between attractive and repulsive polarons. Our results provide a concrete example that illustrates how Rabi oscillations are dressed by system-environment coupling.</p>

            <p>Few-site implementations of the Kitaev chain offer a minimal platform to study the emergence and stability of Majorana bound states. Here, we realize two- and three-site chains in semiconducting quantum dots coupled via superconductors, and tune them to the sweet spot where zero-energy Majorana modes appear at the chain ends. We demonstrate control of the superconducting phase through both magnetic field and sweet-spot selection, and fully characterize the excitation spectrum under local and global perturbations. All spectral features are identified using the ideal Kitaev chain model. To assess Majorana localization, we couple the system to an additional quantum dot. The absence of energy splitting at the sweet spot confirms the high quality of the Majorana modes, despite the minimal size of the chains.</p>

In particular, we demonstrate that applying Raman optical drives to moir√© transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers can realize a class of spin models, with magnetic interactions tunable via the optical parameters. The resulting interaction anisotropy, controlled by the polarizations of the drives, enables access to magnetic states that are inaccessible in undriven moir√© bilayers.

Additionally, the absence of inversion symmetry in noncentrosymmetric crystals enables significant nonlinear optical effects, such as shift current (SC). The $x$-direction component of SC exhibits a ferroicity-driven switching behavior. Moreover, the $\sigma^{yyy}$ component exhibits an exceptionally large spin SC of $330.072~\mathrm{\mu A/V^2}$. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between magnetism and ferroelectricity, offering versatile tunability of electronic and optical properties. $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers provide a promising platform for advancing two-dimensional multiferroics, paving the way for energy-efficient memory devices, nonlinear optical applications and opto-spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergey G. Menabde, Yongjun Lim, Alexey Y. Nikitin, Pablo Alonso-Gonz√°lez, Jacob T. Heiden, Heerin Noh, Seungwoo Lee, Min Seok Jang</p>
            <p>The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.</p>

            <h2>Strong ergodicity breaking in dynamical mean-field equations for mixed p-spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Citro, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi</p>
            <p>The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical (3+4)-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for strong ergodicity breaking in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed p-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics takes place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.</p>

            <p>Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a sharp learning transition for the two-dimensional classical Ising model, all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our results can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Best practices in Quantum Monte Carlo for metal catalysis: CO hydrolysis on Pt(111)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Bagci, Philip E Hoggan</p>
            <p>Hydrogen production as a clean, sustainable replacement for fossil fuels is gathering pace. Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{√∂}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face. Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.</p>

            <p>The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the electron and lattice bandstructures that facilitate charge ordering. CDWs are often considered to compete with Kondo screening and are relatively rare in heavy fermion metals. However, the heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe2 presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe2. This allows for a refined identification of the electronic bandstructure regions susceptible to nesting. We demonstrate that the CDW wavevectors are not linked to bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have been connected to other nesting features, indicating a decoupling from the bulk. We propose that surface-induced modifications of the U-5f electronic structure result in an enhancement of electronic interactions specifically at the nesting wavevectors identified here, thereby driving the formation of the observed surface CDW.</p>

            <p>In 1978, Wilczek and Weinberg theoretically discovered a new boson-the Axion-which is the coherent oscillation of the $\theta$ field in QCD. Its existence can solve multiple fundamental questions including the strong CP problem of QCD and the dark matter. However, its detection is challenging because it has almost no interaction with existing particles. Similar $\theta$ has been introduced to condensed matter and so far studied as a static, quantized value to characterize topology of materials. But the coherent oscillation of $\theta$ in condensed matter is proposed to lead to new physics directly analogous to the high-energy Axion particle, the dynamical Axion quasiparticle (DAQ). In this paper, we present the direct observation of the DAQ. By combining 2D electronic device with ultrafast pump-probe optics, we manage to measure the magnetoelectric coupling $\theta$ ($\theta\propto\alpha$) of 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with sub-picosecond time-resolution. This allows us to directly observe the DAQ by seeing a coherent oscillation of $\theta$ at ~44 GHz in real time, which is uniquely induced by the out-of-phase antiferromagnetic magnon. Interestingly, in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, the DAQ arises from the magnon-induced coherent modulation of Berry curvature. Such ultrafast control of quantum wavefunction can be generalized to manipulate Berry curvature and quantum metric of other materials in ultrafast time-scale. Moreover, the DAQ enables novel quantum physics such as Axion polariton and electric control of ultrafast spin polarization, implying applications in unconventional light-matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Beyond condensed matter, the DAQ can serve as a detector of the dark matter Axion particle. We estimate the detection frequency range and sensitivity in the critically-lacking meV regime, contributing to one of the most challenging questions in fundamental physics.</p>

            <p>We study the boundary criticality in 2D interacting topological insulators. Using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we present the first nonperturbative study of the boundary quantum phase diagram in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard-Rashba model. Our results reveal rich boundary critical phenomena at the quantum phase transition between a topological insulator and an antiferromagnetic insulator, encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Combining analytical derivation of the boundary theory with unbiased numerically-exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of topological edge states enriches the ordinary transition that renders a continuous boundary scaling dimension and, more intriguingly, leads to a special transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Our work establishes a novel framework for the nonperturbative study of boundary criticality in two-dimensional topological systems with strong electron correlations.</p>

            <p>Domain-wall skyrmions are magnetic solitons embedded in a domain wall that are topologically equivalent to skyrmions. Here, we theoretically study antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions and their current-driven motion within the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenology, and verify our findings with micromagnetic simulations. While the skyrmion Hall effect is expected to be suppressed in the current-induced motion of antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions, we observe a finite Hall angle, which originates from the anisotropic spin configuration of domain-wall skyrmions. The skyrmion Hall effect is, however, conditionally suppressed and the motion aligns with the current applied in certain directions, which can be interpreted as principal axes of a domain-wall skyrmion that is easily identified from the symmetry of the spin configuration. Our work on antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions shows that the dynamics of spin textures endowed with multiple soliton characteristics can be unconventional, which is envisaged to enrich the field of topological solitons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. Busel, D. Polishchuk, A. Kravets, V. Korenivski</p>
            <p>We observe strongly nonlinear spin dynamics in ferro-/antiferro-magnetic multilayers, controlled by the number of bilayers in the system, layer thicknesses, as well as temperature, peaking in magnitude near the N√©el point of the antiferromagnetic layers just above room temperature. Well above the N√©el transition, the individual ferromagnetic layers are exchange decoupled and resonate independently. As the temperature is lowered toward the N√©el point, the ferromagnetic proximity effect through the thin antiferromagnetic spacers transforms the system into a weakly coupled macrospin chain along the film normal, which exhibits pronounced standing spin-wave resonance modes, comparable in intensity to the uniform resonance in the ferromagnetic layers. These findings are supported by our micromagnetic simulations showing clear spin-wave profiles with precessional phase lag along the macrospin chain. Well below the N√©el transition, the FeMn layers order strongly antiferromagnetically and exchange-pin the ferromagnetic layers to effectively make the multilayer one macrospin. The appearance and intensity of the high-frequency spin-wave modes can thus be conveniently controlled by thermal gating the multilayer. The nonlinearity in the microwave response of the demonstrated material can approach 100\%, large compared to nonlinear materials used in e.g. optics, with second-harmonic generation often at the single percentage level.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo Hamano, Masahito Mochizuki</p>
            <p>We theoretically study photoinduced magnetic phase transitions and their dynamical processes in the Kondo-lattice model on a cubic lattice. It is demonstrated that light irradiation gives rise to magnetic phase transitions from the ground-state ferromagnetic state to a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic state as a nonequilibrium steady state in the photodriven system. This phase transition occurs as a consequence of the formation of pseudo half-filling band occupation via the photoexcitation and relaxation of electrons, where all the electron states constituting the lower band separated from the upper band by an exchange gap are partially but nearly uniformly occupied. We also find that several types of antiferromagnetic correlations, e.g., A-type and C-type antiferromagnetic correlations, appear in a transient state of the dynamical phase transition. By calculating magnon spectra for the photodriven system, we argue that the instability to the A-type or C-type antiferromagnetic state occurs in the ferromagnetic ground state as a softening of the magnon band dispersion at corresponding momentum points depending on the light polarization. Our findings provide important insights into the understanding of photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the three-dimensional Kondo-lattice magnets.</p>

            <p>Intriguing analogies between the nickelates and the cuprates provide a promising avenue for unraveling the microscopic mechanisms underlying high-$T_c$ superconductivity. While electron correlation effects in the nickelates have been extensively studied, the role of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) remains highly controversial. Here, by taking pristine LaNiO$_2$ as an exemplar nickelate, we present an in-depth study of EPC for both the non-magnetic (NM) and the $C$-type antiferromagnetic ($C$-AFM) phase using advanced density functional theory methods without invoking $U$ or other free parameters. The weak EPC strength $\lambda$ in the NM phase is found to be greatly enhanced ($\sim$4$\times$) due to the presence of magnetism in the $C$-AFM phase. This enhancement arises from strong interactions between the flat bands associated with the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals and the low-frequency phonon modes driven by the vibrations of Ni and La atoms. The resulting phonon softening is shown to yield a distinctive kink in the electronic structure around 15 meV, which would provide an experimentally testable signature of our predictions. Our study highlights the critical role of local magnetic moments and interply EPC in the nickelate.</p>

We find that their state graphs host motifs which produce flat bands in the many-body spectrum at a particular set of energies.

            <p>We present a topological mechanism for superconductivity emerging from Chern-2 insulators. While, naively, time-reversal symmetry breaking is expected to prevent superconductivity, it turns out that the opposite is the case: An explicit model calculation for a generalized attractive-U Haldane-Hubbard model demonstrates that superconductivity is only stabilized near the quantum anomalous Hall state, but not near a trivial, time-reversal symmetric band insulator. As standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like mean-field theory fails to capture any superconducting state, we explain this using an effective fractionalized field theory involving fermionic chargeons, bosonic colorons and an emergent U(1) gauge field. When the chargeons form a gapped topological band structure, the proliferation of single monopoles of this gauge field is forbidden. However, long-ranged monopole-antimonopole correlations emerge, and we argue that those correspond to superconducting order. Using random phase approximation on top of extensive slave-rotor mean-field calculations we characterize coherence length and stiffness of the superconductor. Thereby, we deduce the phase diagram in parameter space and furthermore discuss the effect of doping, temperature and an external magnetic field. We complement the fractionalized theory with calculations using an effective spin model and Gutzwiller projected wavefunctions. While mostly based on a simple toy model, we argue that our findings contribute to a better understanding of superconductivity emerging out of spin- and valley polarized rhombohedral graphene multilayers in a parameter regime with nearby quantum anomalous Hall insulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayan Roy, Shamik Gupta, Giovanna Morigi</p>
            <p>Quantum resetting protocols can speed up the time in which a quantum walker reaches a target site on a lattice. In these setups, a detector monitors the target site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked after a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from the time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked up to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $d$, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays with a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\alpha$. At short times, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of $\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal resetting rate. For $\alpha>1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by the velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice. For $\alpha<1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localise the walker: The optimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as $\alpha\to 0$. We derive simple models reproducing the numerical results, shedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries, and local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium. Our predictions can be verified in existing experimental setups.</p>

            <p>In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes, the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.</p>

            <p>Describing general quantum many-body dynamics is a challenging task due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size. The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) provides a powerful tool to tackle this task by projecting quantum evolution onto a classical dynamical system within a variational manifold. In classical systems, periodic orbits play a crucial role in understanding the structure of the phase space and the long-term behavior of the system. However, finding periodic orbits is generally difficult, and their existence and properties in generic TDVP dynamics over matrix product states have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an algorithm to systematically identify and characterize periodic orbits in TDVP dynamics. Applying our method to the periodically kicked Ising model, we uncover both stable and unstable periodic orbits. We characterize the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori in the vicinity of stable periodic orbits and track the change of the periodic orbits as we modify the Hamiltonian parameters. We observe that periodic orbits exist at any value of the coupling constant between prethermal and fully thermalizing regimes, but their relevance to quantum dynamics and imprint on quantum eigenstates diminishes as the system leaves the prethermal regime. Our results demonstrate that periodic orbits provide valuable insights into the TDVP approximation of quantum many-body evolution and establish a closer connection between quantum and classical chaos.</p>

            <p>The motion of a quantum particle in a one-dimensional periodic potential can be described in terms of Bloch wave packets. Like free-particle wave packets, they can propagate without attenuation. Here, we examine this similarity more closely by investigating whether Bloch wave packets can maintain a definite -- or nearly definite -- momentum direction, a property inherent to free-particle wave packets. This question is particularly relevant to the feasibility of using solid-state-based systems in the search for the first experimental realization of quantum backflow, a quantum interference effect in which a particle's probability density flows in a direction opposite to its momentum.</p>

            <h2>Generalization through variance: how noise shapes inductive biases in diffusion models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John J. Vastola</p>
            <p>How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy. We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions, but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive biases.</p>

            <h2>Topologically Directed Simulations Reveal the Impact of Geometric Constraints on Knotted Proteins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agnese Barbensi, Alexander R. Klotz, Dimos Gkountaroulis</p>
            <p>Simulations of knotting and unknotting in polymers or other filaments rely on random processes to facilitate topological changes. Here we introduce a method of \textit{topological steering} to determine the optimal pathway by which a filament may knot or unknot while subject to a given set of physics. The method involves measuring the knotoid spectrum of a space curve projected onto many surfaces and computing the mean unravelling number of those projections. Several perturbations of a curve can be generated stochastically, e.g. using the Langevin equation or crankshaft moves, and a gradient can be followed that maximises or minimises the topological complexity. We apply this method to a polymer model based on a growing self-avoiding tangent-sphere chain, which can be made to model proteins by imposing a constraint that the bending and twisting angles between successive spheres must maintain the distribution found in naturally occurring protein structures. We show that without these protein-like geometric constraints, topologically optimised polymers typically form alternating torus knots and composites thereof, similar to the stochastic knots predicted for long DNA. However, when the geometric constraints are imposed on the system, the frequency of twist knots increases, similar to the observed abundance of twist knots in protein structures.</p>

            <h2>Combining the Maximum Overlap Method with Multiwavelets for Core-Ionisation Energy Calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas G√∂llmann, Matthew R. Ludwig, Peter Wind, Laura Ratcliff, Luca Frediani</p>
            <p>We present a protocol for computing core-ionisation energies for molecules, which is essential for reproducing X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The electronic structure of both the ground state and the core-ionised states are computed using Multiwavelets and Density-Functional Theory, where the core ionisation energies are computed by virtue of the $\Delta$SCF method. To avoid the collapse of the core-hole state or its delocalisation, we make use of the Maximum Overlap Method, which provides a constraint on the orbital occupation. Combining Multiwavelets with the Maximum Overlap Method allows for the first time an all-electron calculation of core-ionisation energies with Multiwavelets, avoiding known issues connected to the use of Atomic Orbitals (slow convergence with respect to the basis set limit, numerical instabilities of core-hole states for large systems). We show that our results are consistent with previous Multiwavelet calculations which made use of pseudopotentials, and are generally more precise than corresponding Atomic Orbital calculations. We analyse the results in terms of precision compared to both Atomic Orbital calculations and Multiwavelets+pseudopotentials calculations. Moreover, we demonstrate how the protocol can be applied to target molecules of relatively large size. Both closed-shell and open-shell methods have been implemented.</p>

            <p>We propose a straightforward mechanism for achieving unique $k$-space resonance modes in one-dimensional time-varying cavities where periodic temporal modulation creates momentum band gaps through Floquet dynamics. By engineering the synergy between cavity resonance conditions and Floquet mode formation in photonic time crystals, we demonstrate the emergence of a single dominant momentum state that exhibits remarkable robustness against temporal disorder. Through analytical modeling and numerical verification, we show that the interplay between time-varying medium and cavity boundary conditions leads to amplification of specific waves followed by spatial mode selection. This engineered resonance mechanism enables insensitivity to initial wave source configuration and strong temporal disorder immunity. Our findings give a simple mechanism for exploiting narrow momentum bandgaps, and establish a foundation for developing high-quality temporal cavity lasers and advancing extreme temporal predictability in time-modulated systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nischal Mainali, Lucas Teixeira</p>
            <p>Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure, leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops, including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.</p>

We show, through bias control of an isotopically purified silicon carbide (SiC) p-i-n diode, the depletion of not only electrical noise sources but also magnetic noise sources, resulting in record coherences for SiC electron spin qubits. We also uncover complementary improvements to the relaxation times of nuclear spin registers controllable by the defect, and measure diode-enhanced coherences. These improvements lead to record-long nuclear spin Hahn-echo times on the scale of minutes.

            <h2>Simulating the anharmonic phonon spectrum in critical systems: self-consistent phonons and temperature-dependent effective potential methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Monacelli</p>
            <p>Understanding and simulating the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of materials affected by strong ionic anharmonicity is a central challenge in material science. Much interest is in material displaying critical displacive behaviour, such as near a ferroelectric transition, charge-density waves, or in general displacive second-order transitions. In these cases, molecular dynamics suffer from a critical slowdown and emergent long-range fluctuations of the order parameter. Two prominent methods have emerged to solve this issue: Self-consistent renormalization of the phonons like the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) and Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP), and methods that fit the potential energy landscape from short molecular dynamics trajectories, like the Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP). Despite their widespread use, the limitations of these methods are often overlooked in the proximity of critical points. Here, we establish a guiding rule set for the accuracy of each method on critical quantities: free energy for computing the phase diagrams, static correlation functions for inferring phase stability and critical behaviours, and dynamic correlation functions for vibrational spectra and thermal transport. Also, a new TDEP implementation is introduced to fix the calculation of dynamical spectra, restoring the correct perturbative limit violated by the standard TDEP approach. Results are benchmarked both against an exact one-dimensional anharmonic potential and two prototypical anharmonic crystals: the ferroelectric PbTe and the metal-halide perovskite CsSnI3.</p>

            <p>Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is typically considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME). The relation between these two phenomena has the status of a hypothesis and is based on sequence of assumptions. We rely on the Keldysh technique of non-equilibrium theory. It allows us to investigate the accumulation of axial charge -- the process that involves both chiral anomaly and relaxation followed by the energy dissipation. We consider the case of strong magnetic field and calculate directly both axial charge density and electric conductivity taking into account both scattering on impurities and interaction with phonons. We obtain the same dependence of axial charge density on electric and magnetic fields, and the same dependence of electric current on axial charge density as the standard heuristic CME calculation. This confirms (in the limit of strong magnetic fields) the hypothesis that the origin of magnetoconductivity in Dirac semimetals is the CME.</p>

We have separately studied the collapse of both the condensate and the thermal cloud below and above the condensation point, respectively. We have obtained an anisotropy, artificial magnetic field, and temperature-dependent critical number of particles for the collapse of the condensate. We have found a dramatic change in the critical exponent (from $\alpha=1$ to $0$) of the specific heat ($C_v\propto|T-T_c|^{\alpha}$) when the thermal cloud is about to collapse with the critical number of particles ($N=N_c$) just below and above the condensation point.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han-Xiang Xu, Daniel Guterding</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p>

            <p>The role of spin orbit interaction in superconducting proximity effect is an area of intense research effort. Recent theoretical and experimental works investigate the possible role of spin-orbit interaction in generating spin-triplet pair correlations. In this work, we present an experimental survey of thin normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers with Nb superconductor and Al, Ti, Cu, Pt, Ta, and Au normal metals, along with single layers of Nb as reference. We aim to probe the role of spin-orbit interaction and resistivity on the normal metal proximity effect through measurements of the upper critical field. We find that the upper critical fields of the trilayers are lower than that of a single layer Nb reference sample, and that the trilayers with higher resistivity metals, Ti, Pt, and Ta, behave as 2-dimensional superconductors. At low applied in-plane magnetic fields and temperatures close to the zero field transition temperature, we find a possible deviation from 2-dimensional to 3-dimensional behavior in the Ti and Pt trilayers. We also find that compared to single layer Nb films, all of our trilayers show a greater suppression of critical temperature during rotation from an in-plane to an out-of-plane applied magnetic field, with the greatest suppression observed in trilayers with Au or Al. This suppression of the critical temperature under field rotation might appear analogous to the colossal spin valve effect that can be achieved in systems with ferromagnetic materials; however, in our trilayers, only conventional orbital screening contributions to the suppression are present and the additional suppression is not present in the absence of applied magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Most of our intuition about the behavior of physical systems is shaped by observations at or near thermal equilibrium. However, even a thermal quench can lead to states far from thermal equilibrium, where counterintuitive, anomalous effects can occur. A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxation is the Mpemba effect, in which a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down to the temperature of the cold environment faster than an identical system prepared at a warm temperature. Although reported for water more than 2000 years ago by Aristotle, the recent observations of analogous relaxation speedups in a variety of systems have motivated the search for general explanations. We review anomalous relaxation effects, which all share a nonmonotonic dependence of relaxation time versus initial ``distance" from the final state or from the phase transition. The final state can be an equilibrium or a nonequilibrium steady state. We first review the water experiments and classify the anomalous relaxation phenomena related to the Mpemba effect. We then provide a modern definition of the Mpemba effect, focusing on the theoretical frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, kinetic theory, Markovian dynamics, and phase transitions. We discuss the recent experimental and numerical developments that followed these theoretical advances. These developments paved the way for the prediction and observation of novel phenomena, such as the inverse Mpemba effect. The review is self-contained and introduces anomalous relaxation phenomena in single- and many-body systems, both classical and quantum. We also discuss the broader relevance of the Mpemba effect, including its relation with phase transitions and its experimental implications. We end with perspectives that connect anomalous speedups to ideas for designing optimal heating/cooling protocols, heat engines, and efficient samplers.</p>

            <p>We present an approximation scheme based on selective Hilbert space truncation for characterizing non-thermal states of magnetic systems beyond spin-wave theory. We study applications to states that are inaccessible through linear spin-wave theory, such as multi-magnon states and higher-energy states. Our approach is based on the existence of an exact representation of spin operators in terms of finite-order polynomials of bosonic operators. It can be applied to systems with and without a magnetically ordered ground state. The approximation exactly diagonalizes the bosonic Hamiltonian restricted to particular boson occupation subspaces, improving the conventional linear spin-wave approach and exponentially reducing the computing time relative to exact diagonalization schemes. As a test case, we apply the approach to a prototypical one-dimensional model - an XXZ spin chain with an applied magnetic field and antisymmetric exchange coupling. Here the antisymmetric coupling introduces a continuous parameter to tune the system away from its exactly solvable limit. We find excellent agreement between numerically exact eigenstates and eigenvalues and those found via the approximation scheme. Our approach applies not just to higher lying states but also to boson bound states, which could make them more accessible to theoretical predictions for comparison with experiment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akito Daido, Youichi Yanase, Kam Tuen Law</p>
            <p>The recently observed nonreciprocal current-induced zero-resistance state (CIZRS) in twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure has posed a significant theoretical challenge. Therein, the system shows a zero-resistance state only when a sufficiently large current is applied in a particular direction, while stays in an incipient superconducting state with small resistance when the current is small or in the opposite direction. In this Letter, we provide a theory for this phenomenon using a model that encapsulates valley polarization and trigonal warping inherent to the trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure. We elucidate that threefold-degenerate Fulde-Ferrell (FF) states are stabilized, and establish the thermodynamic phase diagram in electric current that manifests the switching behavior of different FF states. We thereby propose a scenario that predicts CIZRS in the presence of domains of different FF states: The incipient superconducting state in small current is naturally understood as a multi-domain state, wherein the inter-domain supercurrent is difficult to flow due to the tiny Josephson coupling caused by the mismatch of Cooper-pair momenta. Nevertheless, a sufficiently large current in a particular direction can selectively populate a certain FF state and create mono-domain pathways with zero resistance. Crucially, due to the threefold symmetry of the system, a current flowing in the opposite direction fails to generate these zero-resistance pathways, thus giving rise to the observed nonreciprocity. Finally, we suggest that the long-sought-after triangular finite-momentum state can also be realized in valley-polarized superconductors.</p>

The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600¬∞C to 800¬∞C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Schnell</p>
            <p>This work makes progress on the issue of global vs. local master equations. Global master equations like the Redfield master equation (following from standard Born and Markov approximation) require a full diagonalization of the system Hamiltonian. This is especially challenging for interacting quantum many-body systems. We discuss a short-bath-correlation-time expansion in reciprocal (energy) space, leading to a series expansion of the jump operator, which avoids a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. For a bath that is coupled locally to one site, this typically leads to an expansion of the global Redfield jump operator in terms of local operators. We additionally map the local Redfield master equation to a novel local Lindblad form, giving an equation which has the same conceptual advantages of traditional local Lindblad approaches, while being applicable in a much broader class of systems. Our ideas give rise to a non-heuristic foundation of local master equations, which can be combined with established many-body methods.</p>

            <p>Introducing disorderness in the superconducting materials has been considered promising to enhance the electromagnetic impedance and realize noise-resilient superconducting qubits. Despite a number of pioneering implementations, the understanding of the correlation between the material disorderness and the qubit coherence is still developing. Here, we demonstrate a systematic characterization of fluxonium qubits with the superinductors made from titanium-aluminum-nitride with varied disorderness. From qubit noise spectroscopy, the flux noise and the dielectric loss are extracted as a measure of the coherence properties. Our results reveal that the $1/f$ flux noise dominates the qubit decoherence around the flux-frustration point, strongly correlated with the material disorderness; while the dielectric loss remains low under a wide range of material properties. From the flux-noise amplitudes, the areal density ($\sigma$) of the phenomenological spin defects and material disorderness are found to be approximately correlated by $\sigma \propto \rho_{xx}^3$, or effectively $(k_F l)^{-3}$. This work has provided new insights on the origin of decoherence channels within superconductors, and could serve as a useful guideline for material design and optimization.</p>

While Bell-like inequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in which two parties perform measurements on systems at different positions, one could formulate temporal inequalities, in which the two parties measure at different times. However, for causally-connected measurement events, these extensions are compatible with a local description, so that no intrinsically-quantum information spreading is involved in such temporal correlations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two spins is violated for a nonzero time interval between the measurements if the two measured parties are connected by a spin chain. Since the chain constitutes the sole medium for the spreading of quantum information, it prevents the immediate vanishing of Bell correlations after the first measurement and it induces violation revivals. The dynamics we analyze shows that, as expected in a non-relativistic setup, the spreading of information is fundamentally limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound. New insights on many-body quantum dynamics could emerge through future applications of our temporal Bell inequality to more general systems.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics in action: effective field theory and holography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Baggioli, Yanyan Bu, Xiyang Sun</p>
            <p>Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effective framework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamical electromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities.</p>

            <h2>Transfer matrix approach to quantum systems subject to certain Lindblad evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junaid Majeed Bhat, Marko Znidaric</p>
            <p>Solving for the time evolution of a many particle system whose dynamics is governed by Lindblad equation is hard. We extend the use of the transfer matrix approach to a class of Lindblad equations that admit a closed hierarchy of two point correlators. An example that we treat is the XX spin chain, i.e., free fermions, subject to the local on-site dephasing, but can be extended to other Hermitian dissipators, e.g., non-local dephasing. We find a simple expression of the Green's function in the Laplace domain. The method can be used to get analytical results in the thermodynamic limit, for instance, to get the evolution of the magnetization density and to explicitly see the crossover between ballistic and diffusive behavior, or to show that the correlations between operators at distance $l$ decay with time as $1/t^{\lceil l/2 \rceil+1/2}$. It also provides a fast numerical method to determine the evolution of the density with a complexity scaling with the system size more favorably than in previous methods, easily allowing one to study systems with $\sim 10^6$ spins.</p>

            <h2>High-entropy Advantage in Neural Networks' Generalizability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Entao Yang, Xiaotian Zhang, Yue Shang, Ge Zhang</p>
            <p>One of the central challenges in modern machine learning is understanding how neural networks generalize knowledge learned from training data to unseen test data. While numerous empirical techniques have been proposed to improve generalization, a theoretical understanding of the mechanism of generalization remains elusive. Here we introduce the concept of Boltzmann entropy into neural networks by re-conceptualizing such networks as hypothetical molecular systems where weights and biases are atomic coordinates, and the loss function is the potential energy. By employing molecular simulation algorithms, we compute entropy landscapes as functions of both training loss and test accuracy (or test loss), on networks with up to 1 million parameters, across four distinct machine learning tasks: arithmetic question, real-world tabular data, image recognition, and language modeling. Our results reveal the existence of high-entropy advantage, wherein high-entropy network states generally outperform those reached via conventional training techniques like stochastic gradient descent. This entropy advantage provides a thermodynamic explanation for neural network generalizability: the generalizable states occupy a larger part of the parameter space than its non-generalizable analog at low train loss. Furthermore, we find this advantage more pronounced in narrower neural networks, indicating a need for different training optimizers tailored to different sizes of networks.</p>

            <h2>Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergey G. Menabde, Yongjun Lim, Alexey Y. Nikitin, Pablo Alonso Gonzalez, Jacob T. Heiden, Heerin Noh, Seungwoo Lee, Min Seok Jang</p>
            <p>The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.</p>

            <h2>Instability of the critical Ngai's coupling and two-boson mechanism in metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Phu Nguyen, Vladyslav Kozii</p>
            <p>We study the properties of a Fermi liquid coupled to a quantum critical boson via the two-boson interaction known as Ngai's coupling. We find that the original quantum critical point is generally unstable, resulting in a finite-momentum spatially modulated state unless two conditions are satisfied: (i) the critical boson is polar and transverse, and (ii) the ratio of the Fermi velocity to the transverse-boson velocity is sufficiently large. If these conditions hold and the uniform state remains stable, we demonstrate that the system enters a strong-coupling regime below a certain energy scale. In this regime, we discuss a self-consistent solution at criticality in two-dimensional systems and show that the critical boson field develops a nontrivial anomalous dimension, $\eta=1/2$. Our findings highlight the significant role of two-boson coupling in critical theories, challenging the conventional view that its effects are subdominant to linear coupling.</p>

            <p>Moir√© superlattices in semiconductors are predicted to exhibit a rich variety of interaction-induced topological states. However, experimental demonstrations of such topological states, apart from MoTe2 superlattices, have remained scarce. Here, we report the first optical detection of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states in twisted WSe2 homobilayer (tWSe2). Specifically, we employ polarization-resolved attractive polaron spectroscopy on a dual-gated, 2 degree tWSe2 and observe direct signatures of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at hole filling {\nu} = 1. Together with a Chern number (C) measurement via Streda formula analysis, we identify this magnetized state as a topological state, characterized by C = 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these topological and magnetic properties are tunable via a finite displacement field, between a QAH ferromagnetic state and an antiferromagnetic state. Our findings position tWSe2 as a highly versatile, stable, and optically addressable platform for investigating topological order and strong correlations in two-dimensional landscapes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Grieder, Shihao Tu, Yuan Ping</p>
            <p>Chirality introduces intriguing topological, electronic, and optical properties to molecules and solids. In this work, we investigate the influence of structural chirality on spin and orbital polarization as well as optical activity through first-principles calculations and continuous chirality measure (CCM). By using chiral selenium (Se) and 2D hybrid perovskites as examples, we demonstrate that chirality continuously modifies spin-orbit splitting and orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization. We establish a direct relation between chirality transfer across organic-inorganic interfaces and inversion symmetry breaking, which induces Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting in hybrid perovskites. Additionally, we examine the effects of chirality on circular dichroism (CD) and the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE), demonstrating how the continuous tuning of chirality dictates their magnitude and anisotropy. Our findings highlight that applying hydrostatic pressure can effectively tune the CCM, thereby enhancing the chirality-induced effects such as spin selectivity. By integrating CCM with electronic structure calculations, we present a predictive strategy for designing chiral materials with tailored optical and spintronic functionalities.</p>

            <p>Point defects in semiconductors are becoming central to quantum technologies. They can be used as spin qubits interfacing with photons, which are fundamental for building quantum networks. Currently, the most prominent quantum defect in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. However, it suffers from spectral diffusion that negatively impacts optical coherence and is due to the coupling of the emission energy with uncontrolled electric fields. The group IV vacancy complexes on the other hand have shown to be significantly more spectrally-stable as they are centrosymmetric and thus immune to the linear Stark shift. They however suffer from several issues ranging from low operation temperature to low optical efficiency due to dark states and difficulty in stabilizing the right defect charge state. Here we search for alternative to the group IV vacancy complex in diamond by systematically evaluating all possible vacancy complex using high-throughput first-principles computational screening. We identify the defects that combine centrosymmetry, emission in the visible range, as well as favorable and achievable electronic structure promoting higher operation temperature and defect levels well within the band gap. We find Zn$V^{-2}$ to be especially appealing.</p>

            <p>Mott insulators with localized magnetic moments will exhibit a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state when the quantum fluctuations are strong enough to suppress the ordering of the spins. Such an entangled state will give rise to collective excitations, in which spin and charge information are carried separately. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on single-layer 1T-TaS2 show a flat band around the zone center and a gap opening of about 200 meV in the low temperature, indicating 2D Mott insulating nature in the system. This flat band is dispersionless in momentum space but shows anomalously broad width around the zone center and the spectral weight decays rapidly as momentum increases. The observation is described as a spectral continuum from electron fractionalization, corroborated by a low energy effective this http URL intensity of the flat band is reduced by surface doping with magnetic adatoms and the gap is closing, a result from the interaction between spin impurities coupled with spinons and the chargons, which gives rise to a charge redistribution. Doping with nonmagnetic impurities behaves differently as the chemical potential shift dominates. These findings provide insight into the QSL states of strongly correlated electrons on 2D triangular lattices.</p>

            <p>Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced nonlinear Hall effect by Cooper pairs near superconductor criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Hao Dong, Hui Yang, Yi Zhang</p>
            <p>Unlike the linear Hall effect that requires broken time-reversal symmetry, the nonlinear Hall effect may occur in time-reversal symmetric systems as long as there exists a non-zero Berry curvature dipole in the absence of inversion symmetry. Interestingly, the presence of time-reversal symmetry is consistent with and thus allows a direct transition into a superconducting phase. Indeed, superconductivity has been established in various nonlinear Hall materials, such as WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$, at sufficiently low temperatures. We find that the nonlinear Hall response should be significantly enhanced near the superconducting criticality, dominated by the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) contributions augmented by superconducting fluctuations, which we attribute to the Berry curvature dipole and a divergent lifetime $\tau\sim (T-T_c)^{-1}$ of the Cooper pairs, instead of the single electrons. Such a controlled enhancement brings the nonlinear Hall effect into various simple experimental observations and practical applicational potentials.</p>

We implement an optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol tailored for limited qubit connectivity to measure entanglement entropy. Additionally, we enhance the randomized measurement protocol for entropy measurement by expanding the unitary ensemble, which increases the circuit volume and pushes the capability of the near-term devices. However, we tackle this challenge by employing a quantum multi-programming strategy that parallelizes circuit execution. This work paves the way for exploring chaotic quantum dynamics and establishes scalable methods for investigating complex entanglement growth on current quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Despite considerable efforts over the last decade, the high-energy phase diagram of the random-field Heisenberg chain still eludes our understanding, in particular the nature of the non-ergodic many-body localized (MBL) regime expected at strong disorder. In this work, we revisit this paradigmatic model by studying the statistics of rare atypical events of strongly correlated spin pairs traversing the entire system. They occur for unexpectedly strong disorder, i.e., in a regime where standard estimates fail to detect any instability. We then identify these very peculiar high-energy eigenstates, which exhibit system-wide ${\cal{O}}(1)$ correlations, as nearly degenerate pairs of resonant cat states of the form $|{\Phi}_{\pm}\rangle\sim {|{\alpha_1}\rangle}\pm {|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$, where ${|{\alpha_1}\rangle}$ and ${|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$ are spin basis states. We propose a simple and generic analytical description of this new class of eigenstates that exhibit system-spanning entanglement. This analytical ansatz guides us in our search for rare hidden cat states in exponentially large many-body spectra. This also enables a systematic numerical inspection of the microscopic anatomy of these unconventional pairs, which appear in a wide range of disorder strengths. In the light of recent studies and ongoing debates on the MBL problem, our results offer new perspectives and stimulating challenges to this very active field.</p>

            <p>The braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) forms the fundamental building block for topological quantum computation. Braiding protocols which involve the physical exchange of MZMs are typically envisioned on a network of topological superconducting wires. An essential component of these protocols is the transport of MZMs, which can be performed by using electric gates to locally tune sections ("piano keys") of the wire between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. In this work, we numerically simulate this piano key transport on a superconducting wire which contains either disorder (uncorrelated and correlated) or noise. We focus on the impact of these additional effects on the diabatic error, which describes unwanted transitions between the ground state and excited states. For disorder, we show that the behavior of the average diabatic error is predominantly controlled by the statistics of the minimum bulk energy gap. When the disorder is spatially correlated, we demonstrate that this leads to an increase in the diabatic error due to a further suppression of the minimum bulk energy gap and highlight the scaling of this suppression with the piano key size. For noise, we illustrate that the diabatic error is significantly enhanced due to optical transitions which depend on the minimum bulk energy gap as well as the frequency modes present in the noise. The results presented here serve to further characterize the diabatic error in disordered and noisy settings, which are important considerations in practical implementations of physical braiding schemes.</p>

            <p>On cooling through a temperature $T_S$ of around 324 K, Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ undergoes a transition from a semimetallic state to one with a gapped electronic spectrum which is suspected to be an excitonic insulator. However, at this transition the structure also changes, from orthorhombic to monoclinic, leaving open the question of whether it is driven primarily by excitonic ordering or by a lattice instability. A lattice instability of this symmetry would correspond to softening of a B$_{2g}$ optical or acoustic phonon mode. Here, we report that elastocaloric measurements of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ with induced B$_{2g}$ strain reveal a thermodynamic susceptibility described by a Curie-Weiss law with a Curie temperature $T^*$ of 298 K. The fact that $T^*$ is close to $T_S$ rules out the possibility that the B$_{2g}$ acoustic mode is responsible for the transition. Since prior Raman measurements have shown minimal softening of the B$_{2g}$ optical mode as well, our finding strengthens the case that the transition is largely excitonic in nature. Our work underscores the potential of using strain as a tool for separating electronic and lattice contributions in phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Manipulating the optical and quantum properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials through strain engineering is not only fundamentally interesting but also provides significant benefits across various applications. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on the magnetic and optical properties of 2D topological insulators MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.</p>

            <p>Narrow and brilliant spectral lines are essential assets for high-resolution spectroscopy as well as for precision sensing and optomechanics. In semiconductor structures and, in particular, in the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system, strong emission lines with nanosecond coherence times can be provided by the opto-electronic resonances of microcavity exciton-polariton condensates. The temporal coherence of these resonances, however, normally rapidly deteriorates as the temperature increases beyond a few tens of kelvins due to exciton dissociation. Here, we demonstrate that the temperature stability of polariton condensates in (Al,Ga)As can be significantly improved by confinement within micrometer-sized intracavity traps. We show that trapped condensates can survive up to ~200 K while maintaining a light-matter character with decoherence rates below 10 GHz (i.e., $< 40 {\mu}$eV linewidths). These linewidths are by an order of magnitude smaller than those so far reported for other solid-state systems at these temperatures. Confinement thus provides a pathway towards room-temperature polariton condensation using the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system with prospects for application in scalable on-chip photonic devices for optical processing, sensing, and computing.</p>

            <h2>Remote electric-field control of antiferromagnetic magnon-polaritons</h2>

            <p>The control of hybrid light-matter states, specifically magnon-polaritons that emerge from the strong coupling between magnons and cavity photons, remains a key challenge in developing reconfigurable quantum and classical devices. Here, we showcase the ability to remotely control antiferromagnetic magnon-polaritons at room temperature using electric field by integrating a highly birefringent liquid crystal layer into a terahertz Fabry-P√©rot cavity containing an antiferromagnetic crystal. Positioned several millimeters from the magnetic material, the liquid crystal allows for adjusting the cavity's photonic environment through electric field. This adjustment, in turn, influences the coupling strength of a particular cavity mode to the magnon resonance, thereby controlling the extent of magnon dressing by cavity photons. Our approach facilitates dynamic and reversible tuning of magnon-photon hybridization without the need for direct electrical contact or alterations to the magnetic medium. These findings create the conditions for voltage-programmable terahertz magnonic devices and new possibilities for noninvasive control strategies in spin-based information processing technologies.</p>

            <h2>Probing the Quantum Geometry of Correlated Metals using Optical Conductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deven P. Carmichael, Martin Claassen</p>
            <p>Recent studies have revealed that the quantum geometry of electronic bands determines the electromagnetic properties of non-interacting insulators and semimetals. However, the role of quantum geometry in the optical responses of interacting electron systems remains largely unexplored. Here we examine the interplay between Coulomb interactions and Bloch-band quantum geometry in clean metals. We demonstrate that the low-frequency optical conductivity of a correlated metal encodes the structure of Bloch wave functions at the Fermi surface. This response originates from integrating out highly off-resonant interband scattering processes enabled by Coulomb interactions. The resulting quantum-geometric contribution appears generically in multiband systems, but becomes the dominant effect in the optical conductivity for a parabolic band. We consider a dilute correlated metal near a topological band inversion and show that the doping dependence of optical absorption can measure how the orbital character of Bloch wave functions changes at the Fermi surface. Our results illustrate how the confluence of quantum geometry and Coulomb interactions can enable optical processes and enrich the physics of Fermi liquids.</p>

            <h2>Intermediate phases in $Œ±$-RuCl$_3$ under in-plane magnetic field via interlayer spin interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiefu Cen, Hae-Young Kee</p>
            <p>$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has attracted significant attention as a prime candidate for the spin-1/2 Kitaev spin liquid in two-dimensional honeycomb lattices. Although its ground state is magnetically ordered, the order is suppressed under a moderate in-plane magnetic field. The intermediate regime of the field has exotic behaviours, some of which are claimed to originate from a Kitaev spin liquid. In resolving debates surrounding these behaviours, the interlayer interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have been largely overlooked due to their perceived weakness in van der Waals materials. However, near the transition, they may become significant as the field energy approaches the interlayer coupling scale. Here we investigate the effects of interlayer couplings in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ structures. We first examine their effects on the transition temperature ($T_N$) using classical Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the interlayer couplings have minimal effects on $T_N$, and the different $T_N$ between the two structures are mainly due to the anisotropy in the intralayer interactions. Focusing on the $R{\bar 3}$ structure, we show that the nearest neighbour interlayer interaction is XXZ-type due to the symmetry, and the next nearest neighbor interaction of the Kitaev-type is crucial for the transition between two zigzag orders under an in-plane field. Furthermore, an intermediate phase with a large unit cell emerges due to the interlayer interactions. Our findings provide new insights into the exotic behaviours and sample dependence reported in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando C. Lombardo, Paula I. Villar</p>
            <p>This chapter explores various aspects of the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) and its implications in the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). We begin by reviewing the origin and fundamental properties of the DCE, including three equivalent mathematical frameworks that offer complementary perspectives on the phenomenon. These formulations will serve as a foundation for the subsequent analyses. We then turn our attention to the practical realization of the DCE in cQED-based architectures, discussing how modern superconducting circuits can be engineered to exhibit this inherently quantum effect. Building on this, we examine how the presence of the DCE influences the performance of a quantum thermal machine operating with a quantum field, shedding light on the interplay between quantum fluctuations and thermodynamic processes. Further, we demonstrate how the DCE can be harnessed to implement a controlled-squeeze gate within a cQED platform, opening a path toward advanced quantum control and quantum information processing. The chapter concludes with a synthesis of the main results and a discussion of potential future directions.</p>

Photonics encompasses a multidisciplinary collection of those directions, where 2D materials contribute with polaritons of unique characteristics such as strong spatial confinement, large optical-field enhancement, long lifetimes, high sensitivity to external stimuli (e.g., electric and magnetic fields, heating, and strain), a broad spectral range from the far infrared to the ultraviolet, and hybridization with spin and momentum textures of electronic band structures. The explosion of photonics with 2D materials as a vibrant research area is producing breakthroughs, including the discovery and design of new materials and metasurfaces with unprecedented properties as well as applications in integrated photonics, light emission, optical sensing, and exciting prospects for applications in quantum information, and nanoscale thermal transport.

            <p>In this study, we investigate the problem of Anderson localization in a one-dimensional flat band lattice with a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic on-site potential. First of all, we discuss the influences of non-Hermitian potentials on the existence of critical states. Our findings show that, unlike in Hermitian cases, the non-Hermiticity of the potential leads to the disappearance of critical states and critical regions. Furthermore, we are able to accurately determine the Lyapunov exponents and the mobility edges. Our results reveal that the mobility edges form mobility lines and mobility rings in the complex energy plane. Within the mobility rings, the eigenstates are extended, while the localized states are located outside the mobility rings. For mobility line cases, only when the eigenenergies lie on the mobility lines, their corresponding eigenstates are extended this http URL, as the energy approaches the mobility edges, we observe that, differently from Hermitian cases, here the critical index of the localization length is not a constant, but rather varies depending on the positions of the mobility edges.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous interference drives oscillatory dynamics in wave-dressed active particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Austin M. Blitstein, Rodolfo R. Rosales, Pedro J. S√°enz</p>
            <p>A recent surge of discoveries has sparked significant interest in active systems where a particle moves autonomously due to a resonant interaction with its self-generated wave field, leading to notable wave-mediated effects including new propulsion mechanisms, spontaneous oscillatory dynamics, and quantum-like phenomena. Drawing from an archetypical model of wave-dressed active particles, we unveil a wave-mediated non-local force driving their dynamics, arising from the particle's path memory and an unconventional form of wave interference near jerking points, locations where the particle's velocity changes rapidly. In contrast to the typical case of constructive interference at points of stationary phase, waves excited by the particle near jerking points avoid cancellation through rapid changes in frequency. Through an asymptotic analysis, we derive the wave force from jerking points, revealing it as an elusive but crucial remnant of the particle's past motion that allows us to rationalize mechanistically in-line speed oscillations, wave-like statistics in potential wells, and non-specular reflections. The results we derive follow from generic wave superposition principles, suggesting their applicability to a broad class of wave-dressed active particles.</p>

            <h2>Tuning Charge Density Wave in the Transition from Magnetically Frustrated Conductor to Ferrimagnetic Insulator in Carbon Nanowire within Boron Nitride Nanotube</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi Ho Wong, Zong Liang Guo, King Cheong Lam, Chun Pong Chau, Wing Yu Chan, Chak-yin Tang, Yuen Hong Tsang, Leung Yuk Frank Lam, Xijun Hu</p>
            <p>The emergence of exotic charge density wave (CDW) alongside ferrimagnetism materials opens exciting new possibilities for quantum switching, particularly in field-tuning CDW electronics. However, these two phenomena often compete and rely heavily on strong electronic correlations. While carbon nanowire arrays have been experimentally shown to exhibit ferromagnetism above 400 K, our research shows that encapsulating a linear carbon chain (LCC) within zigzag boron nitride nanotubes (BNT) induces a short-range CDW state under a competing effect of ferrimagnetism and magnetic frustrations. However, for this exotic feature to occur, the LCC needs to break the symmetry along the circular plane of the BNT. Then we utilize a Monte Carlo model to identify the optimal length of LCC@BNT to tackle its size effect, while also comparing the stability of chains provided by carbon nanotubes. The shorter LCC@BNT displays a more prominent long-range CDW pattern with a tunneling barrier of 2.3 eV on the Fermi surface, transitioning into an unconventional insulator. Meanwhile, magnetic frustrations disappear, and ferrimagnetism remains stable up to 280 K. Our discovery of ferrimagnetic CDW carbyne insulators, which function without conventional periodic lattice distortion, spin-orbit coupling, or complex d and f hybridization represents a groundbreaking shift in thinking, which demonstrates that such exotic properties are not exclusive to transition metal elements. We anticipate that spin fluctuations in LCC@BNT could enable fine-tuning of the CDW pattern, and applying an electric excitation of 2.3 eV triggers an abrupt insulator-to-conductor transition for quantum switching applications.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum inference problems and quantum hidden Markov models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun Woo P. Kim, Curt von Keyserlingk, Austen Lamacraft</p>
            <p>Recently, there is interest in coincident 'sharpening' and 'learnability' transitions in monitored quantum systems. In the latter, an outside observer's ability to infer properties of a quantum system from measurements undergoes a phase transition. Such transitions appear to be related to the decodability transition in quantum error correction, but the precise connection is not clear. Here, we study these problems under one framework we call the general quantum inference problem. In cases as above where the system has a Markov structure, we say that the inference is on a quantum hidden Markov model. We show a formal connection to classical hidden Markov models and that they coincide for certain setups. For example, we prove this for those involving Haar-random unitaries and measurements. We introduce the notion of Bayes non-optimality, where parameters used for inference differs from true ones. This allows us to expand the phase diagrams of above models. At Bayes optimality, we obtain an explicit relation between 'sharpening' and 'learnability' order parameters, explicitly showing that the two transitions coincide. Next, we study concrete examples. We review quantum error correction on the toric and repetition code and their mapping to 2D random-bond Ising model (RBIM) through our framework. We study the Haar-random U(1)-symmetric monitored quantum circuit and tree, mapping each to inference models that we call the planted SSEP and planted XOR, respectively, and expanding the phase diagram to Bayes non-optimality. For the circuit, we deduce the phase boundary numerically and analytically argue that it is of a single universality class. For the tree, we present an exact solution of the entire phase boundary, which displays re-entrance as does the 2D RBIM. We discuss these phase diagrams, with their interpretations for quantum inference problems and rigorous arguments on their shapes.</p>

            <h2>How quantum fluctuations freeze a classical liquid and then melt it into a topological one</h2>

            <p>Topologically ordered quantum liquids are highly sought-after quantum phases of matter and recently, fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) joined the few experimental realizations of such phases. Here, we ask whether a gapped classical, highly degenerate liquid can be the birthplace of FCIs upon the addition of suitable quantum fluctuations. Two competing tendencies can be anticipated: (i) following the quantum order-by-disorder paradigm, quantum fluctuations could induce symmetry-breaking (charge) order, or (ii) the classical liquid builds up long-range entanglement and turns into a quantum liquid. We study spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice subject to cluster-charging interactions and introduce quantumness through a Haldane kinetic term. Based on extensive exact diagonalization calculations and high-order perturbation theory, we find that neither scenario (i) or (ii) prevails, but (i) and (ii) manifest sequentially as the kinetic energy is increased. We demonstrate how the gradual lifting of kinematic constraints gives rise to this sequence of phases. Our results relate to the regime of intermediate-scale interactions present in moir√© systems, where band projections are not suitable to model FCIs and competing charge-ordered phases have been identified.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsushi Uno, Shugo Yoshii, Sotaro Mae, Ei Shigematsu, Ryo Ohshima, Yuichiro Ando, Masashi Shiraishi</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a robust method to dynamically tune magnon dissipation in yttrium iron garnet spheres by equipping a metallic band around the sphere's equator, enabling precise control over magnon-photon coupling states. The collective magnetization dynamics in the YIG sphere induce circular eddy currents in the metallic band, whose magnitude can be systematically varied by adjusting the angle between the metallic band plane and an external static magnetic field. This angular dependence yields a pronounced modulation of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth, facilitating seamless transitions between the Purcell and strong coupling regimes without altering photon cavity parameters. Systematic FMR and cavity spectroscopy measurements confirm that eddy-current-induced losses govern the primary mechanism behind the observed tunable damping. By achieving extensive periodic-angular dependence of magnon relaxation rate, we precisely control the magnon-photon coupling state, approaching the critical coupling condition. These results establish the YIG-metallic-band platform as a versatile and practical approach for engineering tunable magnon-polariton systems and advancing magnonic applications, including those exploring non-Hermitian magnonics.</p>

            <p>In recent years, organic materials have emerged as promising candidates for a variety of light-harvesting applications ranging from the infrared to the visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Their enhanced excitonic binding energies and large transition dipole moments enable strong coupling with light, with some systems already reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime. In contrast, a wide range of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been extensively explored in the literature, exhibiting high exciton stability and strong electron-hole coupling due to reduced screening effects. In this Letter, we present a microscopic model describing the interaction of 2D materials and organic molecular aggregates in an optical cavity. We predict the formation of a hybrid Wannier-Mott-Frenkel exciton-polariton with an enhanced Rabi splitting, exceeding that of the pure organic cavity by several tens of meV. To elucidate this phenomenon, we examine a cavity with 2D tungsten sulfide and a cyanine dye, where this enhancement corresponds to a $5\%$ increase relative to the organic cavity. The complementary characteristics of Wannier-Mott and Frenkel excitons enable the formation of tunable polariton states that merge into a single hybrid state as a function of detuning, allowing for dual Rabi splitting mechanisms. This provides a promising platform for exploring quantum optical phenomena in both the strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes.</p>

            <p>We propose a statistical mechanical framework to unify the observed relationship between the superconducting energy gap $\Delta$, the pseudogap $\Delta^\ast$, and the critical temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$. In this model, fermions couple as a composite boson and condense to occupy a single bound state as the temperature drops. We derive a concise formula for $T_\mathrm{c}$ in terms of $\Delta$ and $\Delta^\ast$, namely: $$\frac{\Delta}{k_\mathrm{B} T_\mathrm{c}} = 1.4+4\log(\Delta^\ast/\Delta).$$ This expression reproduces the standard BCS gap-to-$T_\mathrm{c}$ ratio in the absence of a pseudogap, while naturally explaining its enhancement in unconventional superconductors. The model is supported by comparisons with experimental data from several cuprates and iron-based superconductors, which highlight its generality. This formulation also offers a theoretical explanation for the observed persistence of the pseudogap phase into the overdoped regime.</p>

            <p>Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic materials is essential for advancing their integration into technological applications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy to control magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here, we demonstrate that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few-layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is efficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a polymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the magnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions, reaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement is accompanied by a subtle reduction of the N√©el temperature by ~10K. Our experimental results are fully supported by first-principles calculations, which link the observed effects to a strain-driven modification in interlayer exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish strain engineering as a key tool for fine-tuning magnetotransport properties in 2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics and information storage devices.</p>

            <p>We report peculiar optical properties of the frustrated itinerant magnet HoAgGe, which exhibits multiple magnetically ordered states obeying the kagome spin-ice rule. The optical conductivity is surprisingly higher for light polarization perpendicular to the kagome plane, both for the free carrier response and the interband transitions. The latter ones have strong contributions from Ho $4f$ flat bands located near the Fermi level, as revealed by our \textit{ab initio} calculations, explaining the unusual anisotropy of the optical properties and the pronounced temperature dependence of the interband transitions for out--of--plane light polarization. The key role of Ho $4f$ states is further supported by the large variation of the reflectivity upon the metamagnetic transitions, that follows the field dependence of the magnetization, in contrast to that of the dc magnetotransport data. Such heavy-electron bands near the Fermi level offer an efficient way to control transport and optical properties.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit torque arising from the spin-orbit-coupled surface states of topological insulators enables current-induced control of magnetization with high efficiency. Here, alternating-current (AC) driven magnetization reversal is demonstrated in a semi-magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, facilitated by a low threshold current density of 1.5x10^9 A/m^2. Time-domain Hall voltage measurements using an oscilloscope reveal a strongly nonlinear and nonreciprocal Hall response during the magnetization reversal process. Fourier analysis of the time-varying Hall voltage identifies higher-harmonic signals and a rectified direct-current (DC) component, highlighting the complex interplay among the applied current, external magnetic field, and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, a hysteretic behavior in the current-voltage characteristics gives rise to frequency mixing under dual-frequency excitation. This effect, distinct from conventional polynomial-based nonlinearities, allows for selective extraction of specific frequency components. The results demonstrate that AC excitation can not only switch magnetization efficiently but also induce tunable nonlinear responses, offering a new pathway for multifunctional spintronic devices with potential applications in energy-efficient memory, signal processing, and frequency conversion.</p>

            <p>A twin surface dielectric barrier discharge on the microsecond scale was used in combination with a two-component coating to oxidize 300 ppm n-butane as a model volatile organic compound to CO2 and H2O in synthetic air at room temperature and at 160 ¬∞C. The integration of BaTiO3 as a base material for the coating allowed the successful use of otherwise discharge-ignition-inhibiting materials such as MnO2-CuO applied as a full coating. Application of pure BaTiO3 led to highly porous coatings that do not hinder the discharge ignition and show a negligible influence on n-butane conversion while reducing byproduct formation. Thus, BaTiO3 was identified as a suitable structure-directing agent in two-component coatings, using 1:1 and 1:2 ratios of BaTiO3:catalyst coatings. Coated electrode configurations were compared to their respective uncoated state to highlight the coating-induced changes. The two-component coatings strongly increased the CO2 selectivity, reaching a maximum of 91.6 % at an energy density of 450 J/L and 160 ¬∞C for the 1:2 ratio, corresponding to an increase of 51.0 % relative to the uncoated electrode.</p>

            <h2>Purcell-enhanced quantum adsorption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis P. Clougherty</p>
            <p>Cold atoms can adsorb to a surface with the emission of a single phonon when the binding energy is sufficiently small. The effects of phonon damping and adsorbent size on the adsorption rate in this quantum regime are studied using the multimode Rabi model. It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be either enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in analogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A mesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the adsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and suppresses the rate when detuned. This acoustic cavity effect occurs in the regime where the frequency spacing between vibrational modes exceeds the phonon linewidth.</p>

            <h2>Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uday S. Goteti, Robert C. Dynes</p>
            <p>Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Numerical simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems, leading to two universal laws describing the nature of information dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of a Nonequilibrium Discontinuous Quantum Phase Transition in a Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew T. Wheeler, Hayder Salman, Magnus O. Borgh</p>
            <p>Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions lead to the production of topological defects or domain walls in a wide range of physical systems. In second-order transitions, these exhibit universal scaling laws described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, but for first-order transitions a similarly universal approach is still lacking. Here we propose a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as a testbed system where critical scaling behavior in a first-order quantum phase transition can be understood from generic properties. We demonstrate the applicability of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for this transition to determine the critical exponents for: (1) the onset of the decay of the metastable state on short times scales, and (2) the number of resulting phase-separated ferromagnetic domains at longer times, as a one-dimensional spin-1 condensate is ramped across a first-order quantum phase transition. The predictions are in excellent agreement with mean-field numerical simulations and provide a paradigm for studying the decay of metastable states in experimentally accessible systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Garry Goldstein</p>
            <p>The Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) method is based on a linear transformation between the pseudo wavefunctions and the all electron wavefunctions. To obtain high accuracy with this method, it is important that the local part of the linear transform (inside each atomic sphere) be defined over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work and without modifying the transformation in any significant way thereby making the modifications we propose easy to implement in current electronic structure codes for PAW.. This is done by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more smooth wavefunctions (which have nothing to do with the atomic problem) and having them linearly transform via the identity.</p>

            <h2>Out-of-equilibrium quantum thermochemical engine with one-dimensional Bose gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijit V. Nautiyal</p>
            <p>We theoretically explore the finite-time performance of a quantum thermochemical engine using a harmonically trapped 1D Bose gas in the quasicondensate regime as the working fluid. Operating on an Otto cycle, the engine's unitary work strokes involve quenches of interatomic interactions, treating the fluid as a closed many-body quantum system evolving dynamically from an initial thermal state. During thermalization strokes, the fluid is an open system in diffusive contact with a reservoir, enabling both heat and particle exchange. Using a c--field approach, we demonstrate that the engine operates via chemical work, driven by particle flow from the hot reservoir. The engine's performance is analyzed in two regimes: (i) the out-of-equilibrium regime, maximizing power at reduced efficiency, and (ii) the quasistatic limit, achieving maximum efficiency but zero power due to slow driving. Remarkably, chemical work enables maximum efficiency even in sudden quench regime, offering a favorable trade-off between power and efficiency. Finally, we connect this work to prior research, showing that a zero-temperature adiabatic cycle provides an upper bound for efficiency and work at finite temperatures.</p>

            <p>We introduce a two-fluid mobility model incorporating fundamental aspects of electron-hole (e-h) scattering such as momentum conservation for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches (LDSSs). Compared to previous works that use Matthiessen's rule, the two-fluid mobility model predicts distinct AC responses of e-h plasmas in semiconductors. Based on the two-fluid mobility model, we develop a theory with very few adjustable parameters for simulating the switching performance of LDSSs based on high-purity indirect-gap semiconductors such as silicon (Si). As a prototypical application, we successfully reproduce experimentally measured reflectance at around 320 GHz in a laser-driven Si switch. By injecting e-h plasmas with densities up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$, we reveal the importance of carrier-screening effects in e-h scattering and Auger recombination for carrier densities above the critical carrier density for exciton-plasma Mott transition. Our results also suggest a way to characterize the intrinsic momentum-relaxation mechanism, e-h scattering, and the intrinsic e-h recombination mechanism in indirect-gap semiconductors, Auger recombination. We reassess the ambipolar Auger coefficient of high-purity Si with high injection levels of e-h plasmas up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ and find a minimal value of $1.8\times10^{-41}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$. The value is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the ambipolar Auger coefficient widely used for simulating LDSSs, $3.8\times10^{-40}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$, which was deduced from minority-carrier lifetime in highly doped silicon more than four decades ago.</p>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</p>

            <h2>A Microcanonical Inflection Point Analysis via Parametric Curves and its Relation to the Zeros of the Partition Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julio Cesar Siqueira Rocha, Rodrigo Alves Dias, Bismarck Vaz da Costa</p>
            <p>In statistical physics, phase transitions are arguably among the most extensively studied phenomena. In the computational approach to this field, the development of algorithms capable of estimating entropy across the entire energy spectrum in a single execution has highlighted the efficacy of microcanonical inflection point analysis, while Fisher's zeros technique has re-emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating these phenomena. This paper presents an alternative protocol for analyzing phase transitions using a parameterization of entropy function in the microcanonical ensemble. We also provide a clear demonstration of the relation of the linear pattern of the Fisher's zeros on the complex inverse temperature map (a circle in the complex $x=e^{-\beta \varepsilon}$ map) with the order of the transition, showing that the specific heat is inversely related to the distance between the zeros. We study various model systems, including the Lennard-Jones cluster, the Ising, the XY, and the Zeeman models. By examining the behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and its derivatives in the microcanonical ensemble, we identify key features - such as loops and discontinuities in parametric curves - which signal phase transitions' presence and nature. We are confident that this approach can facilitate the classification of phase transitions across various physical systems.</p>

            <p>Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) provide a platform for probing the quantum nature of mechanical motion in mesoscopic systems. This nature manifests most profoundly when the device vibrations are nonlinear and, currently, achieving vibrational nonlinearity at the single-phonon level is an active area of pursuit in quantum information science. Despite much effort, however, this has remained elusive. Here, we report the first observation of intrinsic mesoscopic vibrational dressed states. The requisite nonlinearity results from strong resonant coupling between an eigenmode of our NEMS resonator and a single, two-level system (TLS) that is intrinsic to the device material. We control the TLS in situ by varying mechanical strain, tuning it in and out of resonance with the NEMS mode. Varying the resonant drive and/or temperature allows controlled ascent of the nonequidistant energy ladder and reveals the energy multiplets of the hybridized system. Fluctuations of the TLS on and off resonance with the mode induces switching between dressed and bare states; this elucidates the complex quantum nature of TLS-like defects in mesoscopic systems. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from the intrinsic material properties of mechanical systems - without need for complex, external quantum circuits. Our work provides long-sought insight into mesoscopic dynamics and offers a new direction to harness nanomechanics for quantum measurements.</p>

            <p>Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</p>

This geometric interpretation allows direct determination of Hopf term without path integral computations.

            <p>Several physical phenomena in superconductors, such as helical superconductivity and the diode effect, rely on breaking time-reversal symmetry. This symmetry-breaking is usually accounted for via the Lifshitz invariant, a contribution to the free energy which is linear in the phase gradient of the order parameter. In dispersive single-band superconductors with conventional pairing, the Lifshitz invariant can be computed from the asymmetries of the spectrum near the Fermi surface. We show that in multi-band superconductors, the quantum geometry also contributes to the Lifshitz invariant, and this is the dominant contribution when the low-energy bands are flat.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wancheng Zhang, Mingkun Zheng, Yong Liu, Rui Xiong, Zhenhua Zhang, Zhihong Lu</p>
            <p>Recently, the large time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin current generated by the non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has demonstrated significant potential for spintronic applications, with both computational and experimental validations. However, considering the broad application prospects and the scarcity of conductive altermagnetic materials, the development of novel reliable methods for inducing altermagnetism is necessary. Here, strain engineering is proposed as a simple yet effective approach. This work focuses on $\mathrm{OsO}_2$--the $5d$ counterpart of $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ sharing the rutile structure--employing $ab~initio$ calculations to systematically investigate strain effects on its ASSE. We find that applying a minor equibiaxial tensile strain $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ to $\mathrm{OsO}_2$ can induce a transition from non-magnetic to altermagnetic states. Only $3\%$ $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ is required to achieve a spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim7\%$ for the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin current generated by ASSE, far exceeding the intrinsic spin Hall angle $\theta_{\text{IS}}$ produced by the conventional spin Hall effect (CSHE). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to non-relativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's non-relativistic origin. Further calculations reveal that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.</p>

            <p>Systems hosting flat bands offer a powerful platform for exploring strong correlation physics. Theoretically topological degeneracy rising in systems with non-trivial topological orders on periodic manifolds of non-zero genus can generate ideal flat bands. However, experimental realization of such geometrically engineered systems is very difficult. In this work, we demonstrate that flat planes with strategically patterned hole defects can engineer ideal flat bands. We constructing two families of models, singular flat band systems where degeneracy is stabilized by non-contractible loop excitations tied to hole defects and perfectly nested van Hove systems where degeneracy arises from line excitations in momentum space. These models circumvent the need for exotic manifolds while retaining the essential features of topological flat bands. By directly linking defect engineering to degeneracy mechanisms, our results establish a scalable framework for experimentally accessible flat band design.</p>

            <p>The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</p>

            <p>The study of quantum vortices provides critical insights into non-equilibrium dynamics across diverse physical systems.

Here, we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of 4D quantum vortices and turbulence. Using a special visualization method, we discovered the decay of topological numbers that does not exist in low dimensions, as well as the high-dimensional counterpart of the vortex reconnection process. We further explore quench dynamics across phase transitions in four dimensions and verify the applicability of the higher-dimensional Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our simulations provide numerical evidence of 4D quantum turbulence, characterized by universal power-law behavior.

            <p>For a neutral system of positive and negative charges, such as atoms in a crystal, increasing the density causes the Mott transition from bound electrons to free electrons. The density of optically generated electron-hole systems can be controlled in situ by the power of optical excitation that enables the Mott transition from excitons, the bound pairs of electrons and holes, to free electrons and holes with increasing density. These Mott transitions occur in systems of pairs of the same kind, such as atoms or excitons. However, a different type of the Mott transition can occur for Bose polarons. A Bose polaron is a mobile particle of one kind in a Bose gas of particles of another kind. For the Mott transition in polarons, the polaron states vanish with increasing density of the surrounding gas. In this paper, we present the observation of this type of the Mott transition and the measurement of the Mott transition parameter $n_{\rm M}^{1/2} a_{\rm B}$ in 2D excitonic Bose polarons.</p>

Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the extended, critical, and localized states can be effectively distinguished via their phase space representation, specially the Wigner distribution. Based on the Wigner distribution function, we can further obtain the corresponding Wigner entropy and employ the feature that the critical state has the maximum Wigner entropy to locate the invariable mobility edge.

Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group symmetry. This form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Maria Centamori, Michele Campisi, Vittorio Giovannetti</p>
            <p>We study the performance of quantum thermal machines in which the working fluid of the model is represented by a many-body quantum system that is periodically connected with external baths via local couplings. A formal characterization of the limit cycles of the set-up is presented in terms of the mixing properties of the quantum channel that describes the evolution of the fluid over a thermodynamic cycle. For the special case in which the system is a collection of spin 1/2 particles coupled via magnetization preserving Hamiltonians, a full characterization of the possible operational regimes (i.e., thermal engine, refrigerator, heater and thermal accelerator) is provided: in this context we show in fact that the different regimes only depend upon a limited number of parameters (essentially the ratios of the energy gaps associated with the local Hamiltonians of the parts of the network which are in direct thermal contact with the baths).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuhiro Seki, Yuta Kikuchi, Tomoya Hayata, Seiji Yunoki</p>
            <p>Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states. Our experiments are made possible by extensively utilizing one of the highest-fidelity quantum processors currently available and, thus, should be considered as a benchmark for the current status of the most advanced quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Observation of a non-Hermitian supersonic mode on a trapped-ion quantum computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Zhang, Juan Carrasquilla, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $\Theta(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andoni Agirre, Evert Van Nieuwenburg, Matteo M. Wauters</p>
            <p>The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</p>

We demonstrate using temperature-dependent trends to prevent overfitting and ensure model physicality. As a case study, we performed mid-infrared VASE measurements on fused silica (SiO2) of various grades, from room temperature to 600 ¬∞C. We fitted oscillator models independently at each temperature, and confirmed the model's physical validity by observing the expected monotonic trends in vibrational oscillator parameters. Using this technique, we generated a highly accurate dataset for the temperature-dependent complex refractive index of fused silica for modeling mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</p>

            <p>We investigate a strongly coupled finite-density anisotropic fluid in $2+1$ dimensions dual to an asymptotically AdS black brane that is a solution of Einstein-Maxwell-Axion theory in $3+1$ dimensions. Despite the anisotropy, the fluid thermodynamic properties align with those of a conformal fluid. Moreover, we show that the fluid is stable under the increase of the anisotropy parameter. Additionally, we analyse the DC conductivity of the anisotropic fluid, showing its compatibility with momentum dissipation due to translational symmetry breaking. In the limit of very large anisotropy we find that the DC conductivity vanishes as a consequence of dimensionality reduction. We also find that a metal-insulator transition arises driven by the anisotropy.</p>

            <p>Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R√©nyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</p>

            <p>The utility of near-term quantum computers for simulating realistic quantum systems hinges on the stability of digital quantum matter--realized when discrete quantum gates approximate continuous time evolution--and whether it can be maintained at system sizes and time scales inaccessible to classical simulations. Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.</p>

            <p>For one-dimensional free Dirac fermions, we compute numerically the probability distribution of the change in the entanglement entropy (EE), after the saturation time, resulting from a single measurement of the occupation number by using different measurement protocols. For the quantum jump and the projective measurement protocols, we observe clear deviations from Gaussianity characterized by broader and asymmetric tails, exponential for positive values of the change, and a peak at zero that increases with the system size and the monitoring strength supporting that in all cases the EE is in the area law phase. Another distinct feature of the distribution is its spatial inhomogeneity. In the weak monitoring limit, the distribution is close to Gaussian with a broad support for boundary point separating the two subsystems defining the EE while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails and a much narrower support. For a quantum state diffusion protocol, the distribution is Gaussian for weak monitoring. As the monitoring strength increases, it gradually develops symmetric exponential tails. In the strong monitoring limit, the tails are still exponential but the core turns from Gaussian to strongly peaked at zero suggesting the dominance of quantum Zeno effect. For all monitoring strengths, the distribution is size independent.</p>

            <p>Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</p>

            <p>To understand the properties and interactions of materials, and determining the ground state energies is one of the important challenges in quantum chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics, where quantum computing can play an important role for studying the properties of materials. In this study, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the He molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems.

            <p>Moir√© materials have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. While recent experiments have unveiled fractional Chern insulators exhibiting the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect based on electrons or holes, the exploration of analogous many-body states with bosonic constituents remains largely uncharted. In this work, we predict the emergence of bosonic fractional Chern insulators arising from long-lived excitons in a moir√© superlattice formed by twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ stacked on monolayer MoSe$_2$. Performing exact diagonalization on the exciton flat Chern band present in this structure, we establish the existence of Abelian and non-Abelian phases at band filling $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$, respectively, through multiple robust signatures including ground-state degeneracy, spectral flow, many-body Chern number, and particle-cut entanglement spectrum. The obtained energy gap of $\sim 10$ meV for the Abelian states suggests a remarkably high stability of this phase. Our findings not only introduce a highly tunable and experimentally accessible platform for investigating bosonic fractional Chern insulators but also open a new pathway for realizing non-Abelian anyons.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric materials like NbOI$_{2}$ have garnered significant interest, yet their temporal response and synergetic interaction with light remain underexplored. Previous studies on the polarization of oxide ferroelectrics have relied on time-resolved optical second harmonic generation or ultrafast X-ray scattering. Here, we probe the laser-induced polarization dynamics of 2D NbOI$_{2}$ nanocrystals using ultrafast transmission electron diffraction and deflectometry. The deflection of the electron pulses is directly sensitive to the changes in the polarization, while the diffraction signal captures the structural evolution. Excited with a UV laser pulse, the polarization of NbOI$_{2}$ is initially suppressed for two picoseconds, then it recovers and overshoots, leading to a transiently enhanced polarization persisting for over 200 ps. This recovery coincides with coherent acoustic phonon generation, triggering a piezoresponse in the NbOI$_{2}$ nanocrystals. Our results offer a new method for sensing the ferroelectric order parameter in femtosecond time scales.</p>

            <h2>Spin Qubit Properties of the Boron-Vacancy/Carbon Defect in the Two-Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergey Stolbov, Marisol Alc√°ntara Ortigoza</p>
            <p>Spin qubit defects in two-dimensional materials have a number of advantages over those in three-dimensional hosts including simpler technologies for the defect creation and control, as well as qubit accessibility. In this work, we select the VBCB defect in the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a possible optically controllable spin qubit and explain its triplet ground state and neutrality. In this defect a boron vacancy is combined with a carbon dopant substituting the closest boron atom to the vacancy. Our density-functional-theory calculations confirmed that the system has dynamically stable spin triplet and singlet ground states. As revealed from our linear response GW calculations, the spin-sensitive electronic states are localized around the three undercoordinated N atoms and make local peaks in the density of electronic states within the bandgap. Using the triplet and singlet ground state energies, as well as the energies of the optically excited states, obtained from solution to the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we construct the spin-polarization cycle, which is found to be favorable for the spin qubit initialization. The calculated zero-field splitting parameters ensure that the splitting energy between the spin projections in the triplet ground state is comparable to that of the known spin qubits. We thus propose the VBCB defect in hBN as a promising spin qubit.</p>

            <p>Realizing semiconductors with high symmetry of their crystallographic structures has been a virtue of inorganic materials and has resulted in novel physical behaviors. In contrast, hybrid (organic and inorganic) crystals such as two-dimensional metal halide perovskites exhibit much lower crystal symmetry due to in-plane or out of plane octahedral distortions. Despite their amazing ability for photoinduced light emission at room temperature, the Achilles' heel of this attractive class of 2D materials for optoelectronics remains the poor control and lack of performance for charge carrier transport. Inspired by the tremendous charge carrier properties of the 3D cubic perovskite phase of FAPbI3 and combining the use of the appropriate cage cation, the spacer molecule and the temperature and rate of crystallization, we report a new series of FA-based layered two-dimensional perovskites that exhibits the highest theoretically predicted symmetry with a tetragonal P4/mmm space group, resulting in no octahedral distortion in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These 2D perovskites present the shortest interlayer distances (4 angstrom), which results in systematically lower bandgaps (1.7 to 1.8 eV). Finally, the absence of octahedral distortions, results in an exciton diffusion length of 2.5 {\mu}m, and a diffusivity of 4.4 cm2s-1, both of which are an order of magnitude larger compared to previously reported 2D perovskites and on par with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p>Controlling spin orientation of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, resulting in the discovery of various phases of matter. However, in most cases, spin orientation can be stablished only at specific directions of out-of-plane and in-plane, which is a drawback compared with three-dimensional systems, limiting exploration of novel physics. Here, we introduce a methodology for manipulating spin slanting in 2D multiferroic materials through ultrafast pulses of light. Based on model analysis, we find that simultaneous triggering spin-orbit coupling induced interactions from in-plane and out-of-plane orbitals can generate spin slanting. By choosing 2D multiferroic materials with specific low-energy composition endowed by symmetry, such triggering can be readily achieved through ultrafast light illumination, leading to light-induced spin slanting. Using real-time time-dependent density-functional theory, we demonstrate this approach in multiferroic single-layer CuCr2Se4. This study provides an efficient way to manipulate spin orientation in 2D materials and establishes a general platform to explore physics and applications associated with spin slanting.</p>

            <h2>Contrasting Light-Induced Spin Torque in Antiferromagnetic and Altermagnetic Systems</h2>

            <p>Light-matter interaction has become one of the promising routes to manipulating various physical feature of quantum materials in an ultrafast kinetics. In this work, we focus on the nonlinear optical effects of the spintronic behavior in antiferromagnetic (AFM) and altermagnetic (AM) systems with compensated magnetic moments, which has been extensively attractive for their potential applications. With vanishing net magnetic moments, one of the main concerns is how to distinguish and disentangle AFMs and AMs in experiments, as they usually behave similarly in many susceptibility measurements. To address this challenge, we propose that linearly polarized light could trigger contrasting nonequilibrium local spin torques in these systems, unravelling hidden light-induced spintronic behaviors. In general, one could achieve light-induced spin canting in AMs, while only Neel vector torques in AFMs. We scrutinize and enumerate their symmetry constraints of all 122 magnetic point groups. We also adopt low energy Hamiltonian models and first-principles calculations on two representative materials to illustrate our theory. Our work provides a new perspective for the design and optimization of spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Gerard R. Sevilla, Jayson G. Cosme</p>
            <p>The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, matter-wave superradiance, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave (DW) phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities, which may hint at an eventual transition to a Mott insulating (MI) phase.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets are a new class of materials, which are promising for spintronics applications, but the experimental proof of a finite sublattice magnetisation is often difficult. Here it is shown that in altermagnets, there exists a large magnetic circular dichroism (CD) in the resonant photoelectron diffraction (RPED) pattern. RPED calculations are performed for MnTe at the Mn L$_{2,3}$-edge resonance, using a combination of atomic multiplet and multiple scattering theory. A large CD of purely magnetic origin is found for light helicity parallel to the N√©el vector. The magnetic CD has the same angular distribution as the difference between the structural RPED of the two magnetic sublattices and its amplitude is approximately proportional to the magnetic CD in X-ray absorption of a single sublattice. This shows that RPED-CD provides a direct experimental probe of the staggered magnetization.</p>

            <p>We investigate both magnon and photon blockade for an antiferromagnetic insulator coupled to a linearly polarized cavity mode. We focus on the cross-Kerr nonlinearity between the two magnon modes, which can be large in antiferromagnets with a weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy. By numerically solving the Lindblad master equations, we demonstrate that the resulting bright and dark modes, i.e., system eigenmodes that couple strongly and weakly to photons, respectively, exhibit distinct behaviors. The bright mode exhibits both magnon and photon blockade due to a weak effective nonlinearity, while the dark mode only exhibits magnon blockade for a detuned cavity photon. The blockade efficiency can further be optimized by appropriately tuning the competing interactions in the system. In addition, we show that applying a DC magnetic field, which lifts the degeneracy of antiferromagnetic chiral magnon eigenmodes, destroys the dark mode and leads to an unconventional photon blockade. These findings provide a pathway for generating single magnon and photon states useful for quantum information technology based on the underlying large squeezing of antiferromagnetic magnons.</p>

The bright mode exhibits both magnon and photon blockade due to a weak effective nonlinearity, while the dark mode only exhibits magnon blockade for a detuned cavity photon. The blockade efficiency can further be optimized by appropriately tuning the competing interactions in the system. In addition, we show that applying a DC magnetic field, which lifts the degeneracy of antiferromagnetic chiral magnon eigenmodes, destroys the dark mode and leads to an unconventional photon blockade. These findings provide a pathway for generating single magnon and photon states useful for quantum information technology based on the underlying large squeezing of antiferromagnetic magnons.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism Without Crystal Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peru d'Ornellas, Valentin Leeb, Adolfo G. Grushin, Johannes Knolle</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism is a collinear magnetic order in which opposite spin species are exchanged under a real-space rotation. Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group this http URL form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fluctuation-enhanced Milli-Kelvin Magnetic Refrigeration in Triangular Lattice Magnet GdBO3</h2>

            <p>Rare-earth-based triangular lattice antiferromagnets, with strong quantum fluctuations and weak magnetic interactions, can often retain large magnetic entropy down to very low temperatures, making them excellent candidates for magnetic refrigeration at ultra-low temperatures. These materials exhibit a substantial magnetocaloric effect (MCE) due to enhanced spin fluctuations, particularly near quantum critical points, which leads to significant changes in magnetic entropy. This study reports on the crystal growth, structure, magnetism, and MCE of a Gd-based triangular lattice material, GdBO3, characterized by a large spin quantum number (S = 7/2). Successive phase transitions (T1 = 0.52 K, T2 = 0.88 K, and T3 = 1.77 K) were observed in zero-field specific heat measurements. Furthermore, thermal dynamic analysis under external magnetic fields identified five distinct phase regions and three quantum critical points for GdBO3. Due to its broad specific heat features and the high density of magnetic Gd3+ ions, we achieved a minimum temperature of 50 mK near the field-induced quantum critical point, using a custom-designed GdBO3-based adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator. Our findings reveal significant quantum fluctuations below 2 K, demonstrating GdBO3's potential for milli-Kelvin magnetic cooling applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Ioannidis, Ching-Kai Chiu, Thore Posske</p>
            <p>Recent experiments engineered special spin-degenerate Andreev states in atomic cages of adatoms on superconductors, the Machida-Shibata states, revealing a promising building block for quantum matter. Here, we investigate the formation of time-reversal symmetric bands by hybridizing multiple such states and analyzing their electronic topological properties. The low-energy theory shows that competing emerging singlet and triplet superconducting pairings drive the formation of topologically non-trivial phases in symmetry class DIII. Therefore, Kramers pairs of Majorana zero modes appear at the ends of Machida-Shibata chains, while two-dimensional lattices host helical Majorana edge modes. Additionally, we discover extended regions in the Brillouin zone with vanishing superconducting pairings, which can be lifted by repulsive electron interactions. Our findings offer new perspectives for manipulating topological superconductivity and pairings in non-magnetic adatom systems.</p>

            <p>The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagom√© bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system. We, furthermore, study the sublattice interference in the system. Our results illustrate the rich energy landscape of twisted Kagom√© bilayers and unveil large Chern numbers (of order 10), establishing twisted bilayer Kagom√© as a natural playground for probing the mixing of strong correlations and topology.</p>

            <h2>Emergent phases in the Yao-Lee model via coupling to topological spin textures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Akram, Onur Erten</p>
            <p>Electrons in metals experience an effective vector potential when coupled to spin textures with non-zero scalar spin chirality, such as skyrmions. This coupling can generate a substantial field, leading to pronounced observable phenomena, including the topological Hall effect. Motivated by this, we consider a bilayer model in which the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee model on one layer interact with topological spin textures on the second layer via a spin-spin interaction. Unlike the Kitaev model, the Yao-Lee model remains exactly solvable, allowing us to perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine its ground state. Our analysis indicates that skyrmion crystals can give rise to a variety of vison crystals that are periodic arrangements of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes with unusual patterns such as a kagome pattern. In addition, Majorana fermions acquire a substantial Berry phase from skyrmion crystals, resulting in phases with finite Chern numbers up to $\nu =5$. In the case of a single skyrmion defect in the magnetic layer, a corresponding defect in the vison configuration can be realized. These defects support localized states when the spin liquid is gapped. Similar to skyrmion crystals, spiral spin textures also give rise to a diverse range of flux crystals. However, in this case, most of these phases are gapless, with only a few being trivially-gapped. Our results highlight the rich physics emerging from the interplay between topological spin textures and fractionalized quasiparticles in quantum spin liquids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toshihiro Yada, Ryotaro Suzuki, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Nobuyuki Yoshioka</p>
            <p>The unitary design formation in random circuits has attracted considerable attention due to its wide range of practical applications and relevance to fundamental physics. While the formation rates in Haar random circuits have been extensively studied in previous works, it remains an open question how these rates are affected by the choice of local randomizers. In this work, we prove that the circuit depths required for general non-Haar random circuits to form unitary designs are upper bounded by those for the corresponding Haar random circuits, up to a constant factor independent of the system size. This result is derived in a broad range of circuit structures, including one- and higher-dimensional lattices, geometrically non-local configurations, and even extremely shallow circuits with patchwork architectures. We provide specific applications of these results in randomized benchmarking and random circuit sampling, and also discuss their implications for quantum many-body physics. Our work lays the foundation for flexible and robust randomness generation in real-world experiments, and offers new insights into chaotic dynamics in complex quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Adiabatic optimal control schemes are essential for advancing the practical implementation of quantum technologies. However, the vast array of possible adiabatic protocols, combined with their dependence on the particular quantum system and function-specific parameter ranges, complicates the task of discerning their respective strengths and limitations in arbitrary operations. In this work, we provide a unifying framework, called $(\alpha,\beta)$-hypergeometries, that allows for flexible, noise-resistant, and easy-to-use implementation of enforced adiabatic dynamics for any multi-level quantum system. Moreover, this framework provides a comprehensive mapping of all adiabatic protocols through a universal cost function and offers an exact analytical characterization of the adiabatic dynamics. In particular, we derive precise expressions for infidelity resonances and establish performance guarantees in the adiabatic limit for any choice of $(\alpha,\beta)$. We also discuss in detail the experimental feasibility of the resulting pulse shapes through analytical and numerical methods. Finally, we test our method for the optimal control of coherent information transfer through spin shuttling in silicon quantum dots with small valley splittings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago V. Fernandes, Francisco J. Gandum, Jos√© P. S. Lemos</p>
            <p>We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.</p>

            <p>Surface plasmons or phonons propagating on a two-dimensional (2D) material can exhibit coupling with resonant excitations in its substrate, and the resulting coupled modes were extensively studied. Similar coupling of edge modes propagating along a boundary of 2D material with the substrate excitations remains unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the edge-substrate hybrid modes using the exact Wiener-Hopf analytical approach. We analyze dispersions, decay rate, and confinement of such hybrid modes both without magnetic field (plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon hybrid modes) and in quantizing magnetic field where edge magnetoplasmons hybridize with substrate phonons. The hybrid modes are predicted to occur in THz and far-IR ranges for several combinations of quasi-2D materials (single- and bilayer graphene, quantum wells, thin-film semiconductors) and substrates with polar-phonon resonances.</p>

            <p>Atomistic materials modeling is a critical task with wide-ranging applications, from drug discovery to materials science, where accurate predictions of the target material property can lead to significant advancements in scientific discovery. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent the state-of-the-art approach for modeling atomistic material data thanks to their capacity to capture complex relational structures. While machine learning performance has historically improved with larger models and datasets, GNNs for atomistic materials modeling remain relatively small compared to large language models (LLMs), which leverage billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets to achieve remarkable performance in their respective domains. To address this gap, we explore the scaling limits of GNNs for atomistic materials modeling by developing a foundational model with billions of parameters, trained on extensive datasets in terabyte-scale. Our approach incorporates techniques from LLM libraries to efficiently manage large-scale data and models, enabling both effective training and deployment of these large-scale GNN models. This work addresses three fundamental questions in scaling GNNs: the potential for scaling GNN model architectures, the effect of dataset size on model accuracy, and the applicability of LLM-inspired techniques to GNN architectures. Specifically, the outcomes of this study include (1) insights into the scaling laws for GNNs, highlighting the relationship between model size, dataset volume, and accuracy, (2) a foundational GNN model optimized for atomistic materials modeling, and (3) a GNN codebase enhanced with advanced LLM-based training techniques. Our findings lay the groundwork for large-scale GNNs with billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets, establishing a scalable pathway for future advancements in atomistic materials modeling.</p>

            <p>Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a thermochromic material that undergoes a phase transition from a monoclinic semiconducting state to a rutile metallic state at 68 degrees C, a temperature close to room temperature. This property makes VO2 particularly valuable in applications such as optical and electrical switches, data storage, neuromorphic computing, and remarkably dynamic smart windows for solar radiation control. VO2 typically needs to be synthesized for these applications as nanostructured thin films. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have been made to control the thermochromic properties of VO2 through crystal structure tuning, doping, and the development of VO2 nanocomposites. Additionally, introducing nano- and mesoporosity has been shown to enhance the optical properties of thermochromic VO2 films. This study presents a methodology for producing highly porous, aerogel-like V2O5 films, which can be thermally processed to form aerogel-like VO2 films. This process is based on sequential plasma polymerization and plasma etching to produce aerogel-like V2O5 films that are annealed to yield ultraporous nanocrystalline VO2 films. The sacrificial vanadium-containing plasma polymers are obtained by remote plasma-assisted vacuum deposition (RPAVD) using vanadyl porphyrin as a precursor and Ar as plasma gas. The aerogel-like VO2 films show exceptional thermochromic performance with luminous transmittances higher than 54%, solar modulation up to 18.8%, and IR modulation up to 35.5%. The presented plasma methodology is versatile, allowing both the synthesis of VO2 plasmonic structures to enhance the thermochromic response and the encapsulation of films to improve their stability in air dramatically. Additionally, this solvent-free synthetic method is fully compatible with doping procedures, scalable, and holds great potential for designing and optimizing smart window coatings.</p>

            <h2>Replica manifolds, pole skipping, and the butterfly effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wan Zhen Chua, Thomas Hartman, Wayne W. Weng</p>
            <p>The black hole butterfly effect is a signal of quantum chaos in holographic theories that can be probed in different ways, including out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), pole skipping (PS), and entanglement wedge (EW) reconstruction. Each of these three phenomena can be used to define a butterfly velocity that measures the speed at which chaos spreads. In a general quantum system the three velocities $v_B^{\text{OTOC}}$, $v_B^{\text{PS}}$, and $v_B^{\text{EW}}$ can be different, but it is known from explicit calculations that they are all equal in certain holographic theories dual to Einstein gravity plus higher-curvature corrections. A conceptual explanation for this apparent coincidence is lacking. We show that it follows from a deeper relationship: The pole-skipping mode, added to the black hole background, can be reinterpreted as the gravitational replica manifold for the late-time entanglement wedge, and its imaginary part is the shockwave that computes the OTOC. Thus pole skipping is directly related to entanglement dynamics in holographic theories, and the origin of the pole-skipping mode is an extremal surface on the horizon. This explains the coincidence $v_B^{\text{OTOC}} = v_B^{\text{PS}} = v_B^{\text{EW}}$ in known cases, and extends it to general theories of gravity with a pole-skipping mode having the usual behavior.</p>

            <p>Reliable trajectory-based nonadiabatic quantum dynamics methods at the atomic level are critical for understanding many important processes in real systems. The paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually novel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories. Substantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and surface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic force arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic states, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic electronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between electronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the relevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is derived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with coordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed for discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient integrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic representations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF can in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the time correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are applied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark models where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is shown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of the electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable simulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear dynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Cristina Rodriguez, Analia Zwick, Gonzalo A. Alvarez</p>
            <p>Quantum probes offer a powerful platform for exploring environmental dynamics, particularly through their sensitivity to decoherence processes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of critical behavior in the estimation of the environmental memory time $\tau_c$, modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process characterized by a Lorentzian spectral density. Using dynamically controlled qubit-based sensors -- realized experimentally via solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and supported by numerical simulations -- we implement tailored filter functions to interrogate the environmental noise spectrum and extract $\tau_c$ from its spectral width. Our results reveal a sharp transition in estimation performance between short-memory (SM) and long-memory (LM) regimes, reflected in a non-monotonic estimation error that resembles a phase transition. This behavior is accompanied by an avoided-crossing-like structure in the estimated parameter space, indicative of two competing solutions near the critical point. These features underscore the interplay between control, decoherence, and inference in open quantum systems. Beyond their fundamental significance, these critical phenomena offer a practical diagnostic tool for identifying dynamical regimes and optimizing quantum sensing protocols. By exploiting this criticality, our findings pave the way for adaptive control strategies aimed at enhancing precision in quantum parameter estimation -- particularly in complex or structured environments such as spin networks, diffusive media, and quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soichiro Shimamori, Satoshi Yamaguchi</p>
            <p>Recent studies by Copetti, C√≥rdova and Komatsu have revealed that when non-invertible symmetries are spontaneously broken, the conventional crossing relation of the S-matrix is modified by the effects of the corresponding topological quantum field theory (TQFT). In this paper, we extend these considerations to $(1+1)$-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries. In the presence of a boundary, one can define not only the bulk S-matrix but also the boundary S-matrix, which is subject to a consistency condition known as the boundary crossing relation. We show that when the boundary is weakly-symmetric under the non-invertible symmetry, the conventional boundary crossing relation also receives a modification due to the TQFT effects. As a concrete example of the boundary scattering, we analyze kink scattering in the gapped theory obtained from the $\Phi_{(1,3)}$-deformation of a minimal model. We explicitly construct the boundary S-matrix that satisfies the Ward-Takahashi identities associated with non-invertible symmetries.</p>

            <p>Sensing and discriminating between enantiomers of chiral molecules remains a significant challenge in the design of sensor platforms. In the case of chemoresistive sensors, where detection relies on changes in electrical response upon analyte adsorption, the sensor substrate is typically functionalized with chirality sensitive molecular receptors. In this computational study, we investigate whether a chirality-blind substrate, such as a graphene nanoribbon, is still capable of discriminating between enantiomers. To this end, we employ a density-functional parametrized tight-binding method combined with nonequilibrium Green functions. For a small set of chiral amino acids, we demonstrate that accounting for the nonequilibrium response of the device leads to significant differences in the electrical currents of enantiomeric pairs of the order tens of nanoamperes. This effect is further amplified when structural fluctuations of the device's active region are considered (1-2 microAmp). Moreover, we propose new quantum-mechanical quantities for enantioselective discrimination in molecular sensors, with an emphasis on binding features and property-property correlations. Therefore, our work demonstrates the significance of nonequilibrium effects in chiral discrimination, laying the foundation for future investigations addressing the design of chiral molecular sensors.</p>

            <p>A relevant problem in statistics is defining the correlation of two rankings of a list of items. Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are two well established correlation coefficients, characterized by a symmetric form that ensures zero expected value between two pairs of rankings randomly chosen with uniform probability. However, in recent years, several weighted versions of the original Spearman and Kendall coefficients have emerged that take into account the greater importance of top ranks compared to low ranks, which is common in many contexts. The weighting schemes break the symmetry, causing a non-zero expected value between two random rankings. This issue is very relevant, as it undermines the concept of uncorrelation between rankings. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a standardization function $g(x)$ that maps a correlation ranking coefficient $\Gamma$ in a standard form $g(\Gamma)$ that has zero expected value, while maintaining the relevant statistical properties of $\Gamma$.</p>

            <p>Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. We consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated with harsh and mild environmental conditions. When the rate of switching is neither too slow nor too fast, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks and the population is prone to fluctuations or extinction. We analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak, and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to what happens in static environments, the fixation probability depends on the migration rate. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</p>

            <h2>Intracellular phagosome shell is rigid enough to transfer outside torque to the inner spherical particle</h2>

            <p>Intracellular phagosomes have a lipid bilayer encapsulated fluidic shell outside the particle, on the outer side of which, molecular motors are attached. An optically trapped spherical birefringent particle phagosome provides an ideal platform to probe fluidity of the shell, as the inner particle is optically confined both in translation and in rotation. Using a recently reported method to calibrate the translation and pitch rotations - yielding a spatial resolution of about 2 nm and angular resolution of 0.1 degrees - we report novel roto-translational coupled dynamics. We also suggest a new technique where we explore the correlation between the translation and pitch rotation to study extent of activity. Given that a spherical birefringent particle phagosome is almost a sphere, the fact that it turns due to the activity of the motors is not obvious, even implying high rigidity of shell. Applying a minimal model for the roto-translational coupling, we further show that this coupling manifests itself as sustained fluxes in phase space, a signature of broken detailed balance.</p>

            <h2>Fragmentation; polyhedron reconstruction; 3d scanning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janos Torok, Gabor Domokos</p>
            <p>Not only is the geometry of rock fragments often well approximated by ideal convex polyhedra having few faces and vertices, but these numbers carry vital geophysical information on the fragmentation process. Despite their significance, the identification of the ideal polyhedron has so far been carried out through visual inspection. Here, we present an algorithm capable of performing this task in a reliable manner. The input is a 3D scan of the fragment which is essentially a triangulated polyhedron, which however has often large number of faces and vertices. Our algorithm performs a systematic simplification using the following steps: - Gaussian smoothing is performed on the spherical histogram of the 3D scans faces to identify the most important face orientations. - Planes carrying the faces of the ideal polyhedron are identified as maxima of the smoothed histogram - Polygon is reconstructed using the identified planes - Small faces are removed in a systematic manner We present two versions of the algorithm that we benchmarked the algorithm against a dataset of human measurements on 132 fragments. Beyond identifying the ideal polyhedral approximation for fragments, our method is also capable of tracing backward the shape evolution of rounded pebbles to their origins.</p>

            <h2>New Insights into Refractive Indices and Birefringence of Undoped and MgO-Doped Lithium Niobate Crystals at High Temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nina Hong, Jiarong R. Cui, Hyun Jung Kim, Ross G. Shaffer, Nguyen Q. Vinh</p>
            <p>The lithium niobate single crystal is a well-known optical material that has been employed in a wide range of photonic applications. To realize further applications of the crystal, the birefringence properties need to be determined over a large range of temperatures. We report refractive indices and birefringence properties of undoped and MgO-doped lithium niobate crystals with high accuracy using spectroscopic ellipsometry in the spectral range from 450 to 1700 nm and a temperature range from ambient temperature to 1000 ¬∞C. The birefringence results indicate a transition temperature, where the crystal transforms from an anisotropic to isotropic property, and the advance of MgO doping in the crystal, which is related to the optical damage threshold of the materials. In addition, the lattice dynamics of the crystals have been analyzed by revisiting the Raman spectroscopy. The results establish the foundation of optical properties of lithium niobate crystals, providing pathways for their photonic applications.</p>

            <h2>Ising machine by dimensional collapse of nonlinear polarization oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvatore Chiavazzo, Marcello Calvanese Strinati, Claudio Conti, Davide Pierangeli</p>
            <p>Ising machines show promise as ultrafast hardware for optimizations encoded in Ising Hamiltonians but fall short in terms of success rate and performance scaling. Here, we propose a novel Ising machine that exploits the three-dimensional nature of nonlinear polarization oscillators to counteract these limitations. Based on the evolution of the optical polarization in third-order nonlinear media, the high-dimensional machine reaches the Ising ground state by the mechanism of dimensional collapse: the dynamics on the Poincar√© sphere undergoes a self-induced collapse into polarization fixed points mapping Ising spins. The photonic setup consists of polarization-modulated pulses in a $\chi^{(3)}$ crystal subject to iterative feedback. We numerically demonstrate that its high-dimensional operation leads to an enhanced success probability on benchmark graphs and an exponential improvement in performance scaling with respect to coherent Ising machines. The proposed polarization Ising machine paves the way for a new class of Ising solvers with enhanced computing capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Autophoretic skating along permeable surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G√ºnther Turk, Rajesh Singh, Howard A. Stone</p>
            <p>The dynamics of self-propelled colloidal particles are strongly influenced by their environment through hydrodynamic and, in many cases, chemical interactions. We develop a theoretical framework to describe the motion of confined active particles by combining the Lorentz reciprocal theorem with a Galerkin discretisation of surface fields, yielding an equation of motion that efficiently captures self-propulsion without requiring an explicit solution for the bulk fluid flow. Applying this framework, we identify and characterise the long-time behaviours of a Janus particle near rigid, permeable, and fluid-fluid interfaces, revealing distinct motility regimes, including surface-bound skating, stable hovering, and chemo-hydrodynamic reflection. Our results demonstrate how the solute permeability and the viscosity contrast of the surface influence a particle's dynamics, providing valuable insights into experimentally relevant guidance mechanisms for autophoretic particles. The computational efficiency of our method makes it particularly well-suited for systematic parameter sweeps, offering a powerful tool for mapping the phase space of confined active particles and informing high-fidelity numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>The cell-centered Finite-Volume self-consistent approach for heterostructures: 1D electron gas at the Si-SiO2 interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vahid Mosallanejad, Haiou Li, Gang Cao, Kuei-Lin Chiu, Wenjie Dou, Guo-ping Guo</p>
            <p>Achieving self-consistent convergence with the conventional effective-mass approach at ultra-low temperatures (below $4.2~K$) is a challenging task, which mostly lies in the discontinuities in material properties (e.g., effective-mass, electron affinity, dielectric constant). In this article, we develop a novel self-consistent approach based on cell-centered Finite-Volume discretization of the Sturm-Liouville form of the effective-mass Schr{√∂}dinger equation and generalized Poisson's equation (FV-SP). We apply this approach to simulate the one-dimensional electron gas (1DEG) formed at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface via a top gate. We find excellent self-consistent convergence from high to extremely low (as low as $50~mK$) temperatures. We further examine the solidity of FV-SP method by changing external variables such as the electrochemical potential and the accumulative top gate voltage. Our approach allows for counting electron-electron interactions. Our results demonstrate that FV-SP approach is a powerful tool to solve effective-mass Hamiltonians.</p>

            <h2>Effect of substrate spin-orbit coupling on the topological gap size of Shiba chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Beck, Lucas Schneider, Roland Wiesendanger, Jens Wiebe</p>
            <p>Realizing Majorana bound states in chains of magnetic impurities on $s$-wave superconducting substrates relies on a fine tuning of the energy and hybridization of the single magnetic impurity bound states and of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). While recent experiments investigate the influence of the former two parameters, the effect of SOC remained experimentally largely unexplored. Here, we present a scanning tunneling spectroscopy study of close-packed Mn chains along the [001]-direction on Ta(110) which has almost identical atomic and surface electronic structure compared to the previously studied Nb(110) system, but a three times larger SOC. The dominant Shiba band has a very similar dispersion, but its minigap, taken relative to $\varDelta$, is increased by a factor of 1.9 with respect to the Nb case, which can be ascribed to the stronger SOC.</p>

            <h2>Sociohydrodynamics: data-driven modelling of social behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel S. Seara, Jonathan Colen, Michel Fruchart, Yael Avni, David Martin, Vincenzo Vitelli</p>
            <p>Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially-generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data is available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our simple hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation-integration transition even with memory-less agents. This suggests an explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood's population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract genomic spaces.</p>

            <h2>Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Ghosh, Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups, which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $ \mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin, and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1) change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on $\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.</p>
