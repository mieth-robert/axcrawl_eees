            <h2>Towards $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics on a cold-atom quantum simulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Majcen, Jesse J. Osborne, Philipp Hauke, Bing Yang, Simone Montangero, Jad C. Halimeh</p>
            <p>Cold atoms have become a powerful platform for quantum-simulating lattice gauge theories in higher spatial dimensions. However, such realizations have been restricted to the lowest possible truncations of the gauge field, which limit the connections one can make to lattice quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a feasible cold-atom quantum simulator of a $(2+1)$-dimensional U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory in a spin $S=1$ truncation, featuring dynamical matter and gauge fields. We derive a mapping of this theory onto a bosonic computational basis, stabilized by an emergent gauge-protection mechanism through quantum Zeno dynamics. The implementation is based on a single-species Bose--Hubbard model realized in a tilted optical superlattice. This approach requires only moderate experimental resources already available in current ultracold-atom platforms. Using infinite matrix product state simulations, we benchmark real-time dynamics under global quenches. The results demonstrate faithful evolution of the target gauge theory and robust preservation of the gauge constraints. Our work significantly advances the experimental prospects for simulating higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories using larger gauge-field truncations.</p>

            <h2>Ferron-Polaritons in Superconductor/Ferroelectric/Superconductor Heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Nursagatov, Xiyin Ye, G. A. Bobkov, Tao Yu, I. V. Bobkova</p>
            <p>We predict the formation of ferron-polariton - a hybrid light-matter quasiparticle arising from the coupling between collective ferroelectric excitations (ferrons) and Swihart photons in a superconductor/ferroelectric/superconductor heterostructure. The coupling provides direct evidence for ferrons and reaches the ultrastrong-coupling regime, with a spectral gap in the terahertz range, orders of magnitude larger than those in magnetic analogues, reflecting the superior strength of electric dipole interactions. Our work establishes superconductor-ferroelectric heterostructures as a novel platform for exploring extreme light-matter coupling and for developing high-speed, ferroelectric-based quantum technologies at terahertz frequencies.</p>

            <h2>Impact of light-matter coupling strength on the efficiency of microcavity OLEDs: A unified quantum master equation approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olli Siltanen, Kimmo Luoma, Konstantinos S. Daskalakis</p>
            <p>Controlling light-matter interactions is emerging as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By embedding the emissive layer in planar microcavities or other modified optical environments, excitons can couple to photonic modes, enabling new regimes of device operation. In the weak-coupling regime, the Purcell effect can accelerate radiative decay, while in the strong-coupling regime, excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates with altered dynamics. These effects offer potential solutions to key challenges in OLEDs, such as triplet accumulation and efficiency roll-off, yet demonstrations in the strong-coupling case remain sparse and modest. To systematically understand and optimize photodynamics across the different coupling regimes, we develop a unified quantum master equation model for microcavity OLEDs. The model is then applied to estimate device performance in the different coupling regimes to determine which one is the best.</p>

            <h2>Realization of a Wigner-Mott insulator in 6R-TaS$_2$ superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongqin Xiao, Geng Li, Yuxuan He, Ke Zhu, Yuhan Ye, Yumeng Li, Lijing Huang, Pucen Xiong, Haitao Yang, Ziqiang Wang, Hong-Jun Gao</p>
            <p>Wigner-Mott insulating states represent a paradigmatic manifestation of strong electronic correlations, in which long-range Coulomb interactions drive spontaneous charge ordering and enable Mott localization at fractional electronic fillings. Such states have been theoretically proposed to arise from the cooperative interplay between onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. However, experimental realizations of the simultaneous microscopic observation of interaction-driven charge order and genuine Mott localization, which are the defining hallmarks of a Wigner-Mott insulator, have remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a Wigner-Mott insulating state in 6R-TaS$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy. By locally injecting electrons into the depleted 1T layer, we induce distinct Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and realize a cascade of insulating phases. In particular, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ charge-ordered superstructure at one-third filling hosts a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. The spontaneous relaxation from excited states back to the ground state demonstrates that this Wigner-Mott phase is stabilized by the cooperative effects of onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. Our results provide direct microscopic evidence for a Wigner-Mott mechanism and establish 6R-TaS$_2$ as a platform for the controlled realization and investigation of Wigner-Mott insulating states.</p>

            <h2>Simultaneous measurement of Raman and nonlinear optical tensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Volodymyr Multian, Luigi Bonacina, Jérémie Teyssier</p>
            <p>Raman spectroscopy and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) are complementary, non-destructive techniques that provide rich and distinct insights into the structural and electronic properties of materials. Raman spectroscopy offers detailed information on vibrational modes, phase transitions, temperature, and local stress, while SHG is highly sensitive to symmetry and orientation, particularly in non-centrosymmetric structures. In this work, in addition to combining both techniques, we propose a novel approach to determine the nonlinear optical tensor, leveraging the spatial and ultra-fast temporal offset of a Bessel-Gaussian laser beam at the microscope's focal point.</p>

            <h2>Optical detection of the quantum Hall effect in silicon nanostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N.T. Bagraev, L.E. Klyachkin, A.N. Malyarenko, N.I. Rul'</p>
            <p>Electroluminescence spectra of a silicon nanostructure with edge channels covered by chains of dipole centers with negative correlation energy are demonstrated. The presence of such chains provides conditions for nondissipative transport of single charge carriers at high temperatures up to room temperature. Due to the suppression of the electron-electron interactions, the macroscopic quantum phenomena such as Shubnikov - de Haas oscillations and the quantum staircase of Hall resistance are consistent with the positions of the spectral peaks of the detected electroluminescence. The obtained results are considered in the framework of Faraday electromagnetic induction, which indicates that Landau quantization leads to the emergence of induced irradiation similar to Josephson and Andreev generation. Moreover, the detected maxima in the spectral characteristics correspond to odd fractional values of the resistance quantum staircases, while the dips in the electroluminescence spectra are observed at even fractional values of the resistance quantum ladder, which is due to the increased formation of composite bosons and fermions, respectively.</p>

            <h2>First-Principles AI finds crystallization of fractional quantum Hall liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Abouelkomsan, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>When does a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid crystallize? Addressing this question requires a framework that treats fractionalization and crystallization on equal footing, especially in strong Landau-level mixing regime. Here, we introduce MagNet, a self-attention neural-network variational wavefunction designed for quantum systems in magnetic fields on the torus geometry. We show that MagNet provides a unifying and expressive ansatz capable of describing both FQH states and electron crystals within the same architecture. Trained solely by energy minimization of the microscopic Hamiltonian, MagNet discovers topological liquid and electron crystal ground states across a broad range of Landau-level mixing. Our results highlight the power of first-principles AI for solving strongly interacting many-body problems and finding competing phases without external training data or physics pre-knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Tuning Terahertz Optomechanics of MoS2 Bilayers with Homogeneous In-plane Strain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Patel, Jose D. Mella, S. Puri, Salvador Barraza-Lopez, H. Nakamura</p>
            <p>Homogeneous in-plane biaxial tensile strain strengthens the out-of-plane van der Waals interaction in \MoS\ bilayers (BLs) and can be used to fine-tune their terahertz (THz) oscillations. Using ultralow-frequency Raman spectroscopy on hexagonal (2H) and rhombohedral (2R) stacked BLs, we observe a hardening of the interlayer breathing modes originating from a strain-induced Poisson contraction of the vdW separation between the layers, and characterized by an effective out-of-plane Poisson's ratio of $\nu_\mathrm{eff} \approx 0.19\text{--}0.24$. Strikingly, this geometric contraction drives the system into a highly repulsive regime of the intermolecular potential, corresponding to a Grüneisen parameter of $\gamma \approx 10\text{--}14$. This value surpasses even the `giant' one reported for phosphorene, establishing these van der Waals BLs as highly tunable nonlinear mechanical platforms that can be addressed at the THz regime, couple strongly with light, and do not need external pressure knobs.</p>

            <h2>Boundary and Symmetry Breaking in a Deformed Toric Code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo Corso</p>
            <p>This work explores a deformation of the Kitaev toric code that induces a phase transition out of the topologically ordered phase. By placing the model on a cylinder, the bulk global 1-form symmetries separate into distinct boundary operators, allowing us to show that the transition is accompanied by the breaking of one higher-form symmetry. Using a holographic $(1+1)$-dimensional boundary Hamiltonian, we extract an effective central charge and find a pronounced suppression near $\beta_c$, followed by its restoration at strong coupling, indicating sensitivity to bulk criticality rather than topological order.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic assessment of machine learning models for solid-state synthesis prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jane Schlesinger, Simon Hjaltason, Nathan J. Szymanski, Christopher J. Bartel</p>
            <p>Machine learning models have recently emerged to predict whether hypothetical solid-state materials can be synthesized. These models aim to circumvent direct first-principles modeling of solid-state phase transformations, instead learning from large databases of successfully synthesized materials. Here, we assess the alignment of several recently introduced synthesis prediction models with material and reaction thermodynamics, quantified by the energy with respect to the convex hull and a metric accounting for thermodynamic selectivity of enumerated synthesis reactions. A dataset of successful synthesis recipes was used to determine the likely bounds on both quantities beyond which materials can be deemed unlikely to be synthesized. With these bounds as context, thermodynamic quantities were computed using the CHGNet foundation potential for thousands of new hypothetical materials generated using the Chemeleon generative model. Four recently published machine learning models for synthesizability prediction were applied to this same dataset, and the resultant predictions were considered against computed thermodynamics. We find these models generally overpredict the likelihood of synthesis, but some model scores do trend with thermodynamic heuristics, assigning lower scores to materials that are less stable or do not have an available synthesis recipe that is calculated to be thermodynamically selective. In total, this work identifies existing gaps in machine learning models for materials synthesis and introduces a new approach to assess their quality in the absence of extensive negative examples (failed syntheses).</p>

            <h2>Universal Quantized Berry-Dipole Flat Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingyang Mo, Shuang Zhang</p>
            <p>Perfectly flat bands with nontrivial quantum geometry have emerged as a frontier for exotic topological phenomena and superconductors. Here, we unveil a universal family of quantized Berry-dipole flat bands in chiral-symmetric (2n+1)-band systems, where the central perfectly flat band carries a Berry-dipole moment d=n, with n an arbitrary integer, while preserving zero Chern number. We construct explicit lattice models to showcase three topological phenomena characterized by the Berry-dipole moment: a flat-band returning pump featuring bidirectional, soliton-like displacement of Wannier centers by exactly n unit cells per half cycle, a dipolar Haldane phase diagram arising from the competition between time-reversal and parity symmetries, and n pairs of bulk helical zero modes whose existence depends on the orientation of pseudomagnetic field. Our findings establish a universal framework for the topology beyond Chern class in perfectly flat bands and provide a tunable platform for exploring quantum geometry and interaction-driven phases.</p>

            <h2>High-Throughput Discovery of Two-Dimensional Materials Exhibiting Strong Rashba-Edelstein effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Binchang Zhou, Baoru Pan, Pan Zhou, Yuzhong Hu, Songmin Liu, Lizhong Sun</p>
            <p>The Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE), which generates spin accumulation under an applied electric current, quantifies charge-to-spin conversion (CSC) efficiency in non-centrosymmetric systems. However, systematic investigations of REE in two-dimensional (2D) materials remain scarce. To address this gap, we perform a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on the 80 crystallographic layer groups, elucidating the relationship between materials' symmetries and the geometric characteristics of the REE response tensor. Our analysis identifies 13 distinct symmetry classes for the tensor and reveals all potential material candidates. Considering the requirement of strong spin-orbit coupling for a large REE response, we screen the C2DB database and identify 54 promising 2D materials. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the largest REE response coefficients in these materials exceed those reported for other 2D systems by an order of magnitude, indicating exceptionally high CSC efficiency. Focusing on three representative materials, including HgI2, AgTlP2Se6 and BrGaTe, we show that their large response coefficients can be well explained by effective kp models and the characteristic spin textures around high-symmetry points in momentum space. This work provides a systematic framework and identifies high-performance candidates, paving the way for future exploration of REE-driven CSC in 2D materials.</p>

The dynamics of the generated wavepacket is characterized in the time domain using a degenerate pump-probe technique with mid-infrared femtosecond pulses via transient polarization anisotropy of the probe pulse. In addition, we study the role of resonantly excited carriers, and we show that the amplitude and coherence time of the electronic wavepacket depend on the pre-excited carrier density. Further, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, the Raman-type excitation changes to displacive impulsive excitation, which allows us to address the Raman-forbidden transition between $1s\left(A_1\right)$ and $1s\left(T_1\right)$.</p>

            <h2>Optical signatures of -1/3 fractional quantum anomalous Hall state in twisted MoTe2</h2>

            <p>The discovery of fractional charge excitations in new platforms offers crucial insights into strongly correlated quantum phases. While a range of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states have recently been observed in two-dimensional twisted moire systems, the theoretically anticipated filling factor v = -1/3 FQAH state has remained elusive, with debates centering on its nature of charge density wave or a topological Chern insulator. Here, we report the optical detection of a v = -1/3 FQAH state in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. Using photoluminescence (PL) and reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) techniques, we identify ferromagnetic states at filling factors v = -1, -2/3, and -1/3, all tunable by a vertical electric field. The corresponding Curie temperatures are approximately 11 K, 3.5 K, and 2.4 K, respectively. The -1/3 state emerges over a narrower electric field range and a lower temperature compared to the integer and other fractional states, indicating its fragile nature that may lead to its absence in previous reports. Notably, the PL spectra at v = -1/3 disperse as the out-of-plane magnetic field increases, consistent with a nontrivial topological origin. Theoretical calculations based on the exact diagonalization method further support the interpretation of this topologically non-trivial state.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Quantum Droplets in Binary Bose-Einstein Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongshuai Liu, Boris A. Malomed, Wen Zhang</p>
            <p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which integrate deep learning with physical prior knowledge, have proven to be a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of high-dimensional nonlinear systems. The present work utilizes PINNs to analyze the existence and evolution of quantum droplets (QDs) in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), revealing the ability of this technique to accurately predict structural features of the QDs, their multipeak profiles, and dynamical behavior. The stable evolution of multipole QDs is thus demonstrated. Comparing different network architectures, including the training time, loss values, and $\mathbb{L_{2}}$ error, PINNs accurately predict specific dynamical characteristics of QDs. Furthermore, the PINN robustness is evaluated by the application of PINN to parameter-discovery tasks, considering both clean training data and data contaminated by $1\%$ random noise. The results highlight the efficiency of PINNs in modeling complex quantum systems and extracting reliable parameters under the noisy conditions.</p>

            <h2>Spin-momentum Locking and Topological Vector Charge Response with Conserved Spin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoonseok Hwang, Penghao Zhu, Taylor L. Hughes</p>
            <p>Spin-momentum locking plays a fundamental role in spintronics and, more broadly, is an important concept in condensed matter physics. In 2D and 3D, spin-momentum locking typically does not allow spin-conservation because the spin-1/2 operators of electrons anticommute. Instead, here we study spin-momentum locking terms with conserved, commuting pseudospins built from a combination of spin and orbitals. We find that 2D spin-momentum locking terms with conserved pseudospins generally lead to linearly dispersing modes at low-energy with anomalous charge and pseudospin currents. To cure the anomaly we show that such anomalous modes can be realized on the surface of a 3D Weyl semimetal (or an associated weak topological insulator) with a nonzero mixed spin-momentum quadrupole moment, which is determined by the momentum location and pseudospin eigenvalues of Weyl points at the Fermi level. Crucially, this mixed quadrupole moment captures a mixed pseudospin-charge bulk response that cancels the anomaly of surface modes, and can generate a giant 3D spin Hall effect, among other phenomena.</p>

            <h2>High spin, low spin or gapped spins: magnetism in the bilayer nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanbit Oh, Yi-Ming Wu, Julian May-Mann, Yijun Yu, Harold Y. Hwang, Ya-Hui Zhang, S. Raghu</p>
            <p>Inspired by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, we investigate the role of magnetism emerging from a hypothetical insulating $d^8$ parent state. We demonstrate that due to the interplay of superexchange and Hund's coupling, the system can be in a high-spin, low-spin or spin-gapped state. The low-spin state has singlets across the bilayer in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, with charge carriers in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Thus, at low energy scales, it behaves as an effective one band system when hole doped. By contrast, the high-spin state is a more robust, spin-1 antiferromagnet. Using Hartree-Fock methods, we find that for fixed interaction strength and doping, high-spin magnetism remains more robust than the low-spin counterpart. Whether this implies that the high spin state provides a stronger pairing glue, or more strongly competes with superconductivity remains an open question. Our analysis therefore underscores the importance of identifying the spin state for understanding superconductivity in nickelates.</p>

            <h2>Revealing THz optical signatures of Shiba-state-induced gapped and gapless superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Yang, R. Y. Fang, S. L. Zhang, L. Q. Chen</p>
            <p>We report a fully self-consistent calculation of the complex renormalization by exchange interactions and hence the complete phase diagram of conventional $s$-wave superconductors with magnetic impurities as well as the related physical properties including the optical response. We show that a small amount of magnetic disorder can drive the system into a gapless superconducting state, where the single-particle excitation gap vanishes whereas the superconducting order parameter $\Delta_0$ remains finite. In this phase, the linear optical conductivity exhibits a finite absorption over the low-frequency regime, particularly for photon energies below the conventional threshold $2|\Delta_0|$, even at low temperatures, in sharp contrast to the gapped state. The nonlinear response, however, remains coherent and is dominated by the Higgs-mode dynamics rather than gapless quasiparticle background. These findings reveal a fundamental distinction between dissipative single-particle excitations and coherent collective dynamics of the condensate, a feature likely general to other gapless superconductors, and introduces a fundamentally different detection scheme, using THz spectroscopy to probe the signatures of Shiba states.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation induced Majarona $0$- and $π$-modes in a driven Rashba nanowire</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustabh Gogoi, Tanay Nag, Arnob Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and $\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes (TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We show that both the topological (MZMs and MPMs) and trivial (TZMs and TPMs) edge modes are robust against onsite disorder. We study the topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.</p>

            <p>Dimension in physical systems determines universal properties at criticality. Yet, the impact of structural perturbations on dimensionality remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the attraction basins of structural fixed points in scale-invariant networks from a renormalization group perspective, demonstrating that basin stability connects to a structural phase transition. This topology-dependent effect, which we term geometric criticality, triggers a geometric breakdown hitherto unknown, which induces non-trivial fractal dimensions and unveils hidden LRG flows toward unstable structural fixed points. Our systematic study of how networks and lattices respond to disorder paves the way for future analysis of non-ergodic behavior induced by quenched disorder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vic Vander Linden, Boris De Vos, Kevin Vervoort, Frank Verstraete, Atsushi Ueda</p>
            <p>The quantum $5$-state Potts model is known to possess a perturbative description using complex conformal field theory (CCFT), the analytic continuation of ``theory space" to a complex plane. To study the corresponding complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $\lambda$. Although the variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover, we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state. Our work demonstrates how tensor networks are the correct approach to capturing the approximate conformal invariance of weakly first-order phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Characterization of the dynamics of an impurity immersed in a quantum medium is vital for fundamental understanding of matter as well as applications in modern day quantum technologies. The case of strong and long-ranged interactions is of particular importance here, as it opens the possibility to leverage quantum correlations in controlling the system properties. Here, we consider a charged impurity moving in a bosonic gas and study its properties out of equilibrium. We extract the stationary momentum of the ion at long times, which is nonzero due to the superfluid nature of the medium, and the effective mass which stems from dressing the impurity with the host atoms. The nonlinear evolution leads not only to emission of density waves, but also momentum transfer back to the ion, resulting in the possibility of oscillatory dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhojit Roy, Andreas Kreisel, Brian M. Andersen, Shantanu Mukherjee</p>
            <p>A variety of experimental observations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors with Ising spin-orbit coupling suggest the presence of an unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism. Some of these experiments include observation of Leggett modes and a nodal superconducting gap in STM experiments, a large in-plane upper critical field compared to the Pauli limit, and the observation of a two-fold gap anisotropy in magnetoresistance measurements. Here, we propose a superconducting pairing mechanism mediated by spin and charge fluctuations and identify the dominant superconducting instability relevant to monolayer TaS$_2$. We then explore the effect of an additional electron-phonon pairing contribution, and compare our results with recent experimental findings. In particular, our theory stabilizes a superconducting ground state with nodal-like density of states that agrees with STM experiments. The theory obtains a large in-plane upper critical field due to a combination of Ising spin-orbit coupling and even-odd parity mixing in the superconducting state. Further, we find that an in-plane magnetic field splits the degeneracy of the superconducting ground state, and the resulting two-fold symmetric superconducting order parameter could explain the gap anisotropy observed in magnetoresistance experiments. Overall, the proposed theoretical pairing model can reconcile diverse experimental observations and remains consistent with observations on other dichalcogenide superconductors such as monolayer NbSe$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Advection selects pattern in multistable emulsions of active droplets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Köstler, Yicheng Qiang, Guido Kusters, David Zwicker</p>
            <p>Controlling the size of droplets, for example in biological cells, is challenging because large droplets typically outcompete smaller droplets due to surface tension. This coarsening is generally accelerated by hydrodynamic effects, but active chemical reactions can suppress it. We show that the interplay of these processes leads to three different dynamical regimes: (1) Advection dominates the coalescence of small droplets, (2) diffusion leads to Ostwald ripening for intermediate sizes, and (3) reactions finally suppress coarsening. Interestingly, a range of final droplet sizes is stable, of which one is selected depending on initial conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic effects control initial droplet sizes, but they do not affect the later dynamics, in contrast to passive emulsions.</p>

            <h2>Fate of entanglement in open quantum spin liquid: Time evolution of its genuine multipartite negativity upon sudden coupling to a dissipative bosonic environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Many-body entanglement properties of quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate both the {\em stability} and {\em spatial distribution} of entanglement for the Kitaev model of QSL, which is made {\em open} by its sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and then time-evolved in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. From the time-dependent density matrix of QSL subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and the expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: ({\em i}) in the Markovian regime, it remains nonzero only in hexagonal loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs), eventually vanishing on the same timescale on which the EV of the Wilson loop operator vanishes; ({\em ii}) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, surprisingly, GMN remains nonzero up to much higher temperatures while also remaining zero in non-loopy subregions. In addition, the non-Markovian dynamics generates emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via engineering of dissipation.</p>

            <h2>Crossed surface flat bands in three-dimensional superconducting altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuri Fukaya, Bo Lu, Keiji Yada, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena, but their study has involved two-dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with spin-singlet chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the interplay between superconducting and altermagnetic symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands are topologically protected, appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, and their number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed flat bands or surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to the coexistence of three distinct dependences of the charge conductance on the normal transparency, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher-dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</p>

            <p>The Discrete Non Linear Schrödinger (DNLS) model, due to the existence of two conserved quantities, displays an equilibrium transition between a homogeneous phase at positive absolute temperature and a localized phase at negative absolute temperature. Here, we provide a mean-field theory of DNLS through a suitable approximation of the grandcanonical partition function which makes it factorizable. By comparing our mean-field results with numerically exact ones, we show that this approximation is semi-quantitatively correct in the whole grandcanonical phase diagram, becoming increasingly accurate in proximity of the transition line and exact along the line itself. Our mean-field theory suggests that the passage from stable positive-temperature to metastable negative-temperature states is smooth and allows for a more accurate description of the metastable region.</p>

            <p>Point defects give rise to sharp modifications in the structures and electronic properties of two-dimensional metals, offering an atomic-level platform for fundamental studies and potential applications. In this work, we investigate atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated between epitaxial graphene and SiC using scanning tunneling microscopy. Dark and bright defects are identified as vacancies or substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state. Remarkably, under tunneling electron excitation at negative bias, the bright defects exhibit dynamic behaviors characterized by inelastic switching between two states. The switching can be reversibly controlled by the microscope tip, enabling the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Analysis of defect switching reveals possible defect origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species. Our findings establish a pathway to precise manipulation of defects in two-dimensional metals and uncover previously unexplored dynamics with potential use in nanoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>Routes to the density profile and structural inconsistency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. M. Tschopp, H. Vahid, J. M. Brader</p>
            <p>Classical density functional theory (DFT) is the primary method for investigations of inhomogeneous fluids in external fields. It requires the excess Helmholtz free energy functional as input to an Euler-Lagrange equation for the one-body density. A variant of this methodology, the force-DFT, uses instead the Yvon-Born-Green equation to generate density profiles. It is known that the latter are consistent with the virial route to the thermodynamics, while DFT is consistent with the compressibility route. In this work we will show an alternative DFT scheme using the Lovett-Mou-Buff-Wertheim (LMBW) equation to obtain density profiles, that are shown to be also consistent with the compressibility route. However, force-DFT and LMBW DFT can both be implemented using a closure relation on the level of the two-body correlation functions. This is proven to be an advantageous feature, opening the possibility of an optimisation scheme in which the structural inconsistency between different routes to the density profile is minimized. (Structural inconsistency is a generalization of the notion of thermodynamic inconsistency, familiar from bulk integral equation studies.) Numerical results are given for the density profiles of two-dimensional systems of hard-core Yukawa particles with a repulsive or an attractive tail, in planar geometry.</p>

            <p>We report the experimental discovery of bulk superconductivity in two kagome lattice compounds, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$, which were predicted through machine learning-accelerated high-throughput screening combined with first principles calculations. These materials crystallize in the hexagonal CeCo$_3$B$_2$-type structure with planar kagome networks formed by Ru atoms. We observe superconducting critical temperatures of $T_{c} = 0.81$~K for YRu$_3$B$_2$ and $T_{c} = 0.95$~K for LuRu$_3$B$_2$, confirmed through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Both compounds exhibit nearly 100\% superconducting volume fractions, demonstrating bulk superconductivity. Compared with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$ show a more dispersive Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ quasi-flat band (and thus a reduced DOS at $E_F$) together with an overall hardening of the phonon spectrum, both of which lower the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $\lambda$. Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $\lambda$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening. Superfluid weight calculations show that conventional contributions dominate over quantum geometric effects due to the dispersive nature of bands near the Fermi level. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning screening, first principles theory, and experimental synthesis for accelerating the discovery of new superconducting materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masoud Bahari, Kristian Mæland, Carsten Timm, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>We develop a symmetry-adapted multipolar $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory close to the bulk $\Gamma$ point for time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric $C_{3v}$ crystals in the strong atomic spin-orbit-coupling ($jj$-coupling) limit. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j>1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.</p>

            <p>Charge-$4e$ superconductors are phases where quartets of electrons condense in the absence of Cooper pairing condensation. They exhibit distinctive signatures including fractional flux quantization and anomalous Josephson effects, and are actively being explored in strongly correlated systems, such as moiré materials. In this work we develop a general framework for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors based on both wavefunction and field theory approaches. In particular, we generate topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors from charge-$2e$ ingredients, and by breaking the charge $U(1)$ symmetry in certain classes of quantum Hall states, in both spinless and spinful systems. Via bulk-edge correspondence, we further construct the corresponding edge conformal field theory and bulk topological quantum field theory for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors that suggests fermionic nonabelian topological orders. Our results provide a unified low-energy description of the topological charge-$2ne$ superconductivity, offer a concrete platform for studying symmetry breaking and enrichment in interacting topological phases of matter, and have direct implications for experimental probes such as quasiparticle interferometry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rao Uzair Ahmad, Nasir Javed</p>
            <p>Zinc sulphide (ZnS) is a non-toxic, wide-bandgap II-VI semiconductor with well-established optoelectronic properties. In this work, ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized using polymer-assisted wet-chemical routes, namely hydrothermal processing and room-temperature co-precipitation. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were employed as capping agents to investigate their influence on particle growth, dispersion, and optical behaviour. Room-temperature co-precipitation produced ZnS QDs with crystallite sizes as small as 2.03 nm, whereas hydrothermal synthesis at elevated temperature resulted in larger crystallites exceeding approximately 6 nm. X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of cubic zinc-blende ZnS in all samples, with peak broadening and minor lattice parameter variations associated with nanoscale dimensions. UV-visible absorption spectra exhibited systematic shifts in the absorption edge, with optical bandgap values ranging from 3.60 eV to 3.80 eV, consistent with size-dependent quantum confinement effects. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements verified effective polymer capping and particle size distribution, with PVP providing stronger growth suppression and improved dispersion compared to PEG. These results provide insight into the role of polymer-nanocrystal interactions in wet-chemical synthesis and demonstrate how synthesis route and polymer chemistry influence the structural and optical properties of ZnS nanoparticles.</p>

            <p>We develop an efficient package for the simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance spin echo experiments to study the effects of strong electronic spin correlations on the dynamics of the nuclear spin ensemble. A mean-field model is used to study correlated electronic phases through their hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins. We explore the dynamics of the interacting nuclear ensemble and discuss the key behaviors of the system. In particular, we classify the types of temporal asymmetry that the interaction induces in the system as well as a pulse-dependent shift in the spectral domain. Using these results, we discuss how careful measurement of the pulse-dependent shift can be used to extract information about the anisotropy of the electronic interaction and how these results represent a novel tool for the examination of exotic NMR signatures in strongly correlated materials. Finally, we review specific aspects of the simulation package developed for our exploration and give explicit examples where package can be used to infer range and anisotropy of electronic correlations. In particular, we discuss its structure, accuracy, and the technical merits of the various approximations used to model the nuclear spin ensemble.</p>

            <h2>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Zaccone</p>
            <p>Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</p>

            <p>The emergence of states with long-range correlations in a disordered landscape is rare, as disorder typically suppresses the particle mobility required for long-range coherence. But when more than two energy levels are available per site, disorder can induce resonances that locally enhance mobility. Here we explore phases arising from the interplay between disorder, kinetic energy, and interactions on a superconducting processor with qutrit readout and control. Compressibility measurements distinguish an incompressible Mott insulator from surrounding compressible phases and reveal signatures of glassiness, reflected in non-ergodic behavior. Spatially-resolved two-point correlator measurements identify regions of the phase diagram with a non-vanishing condensate fraction. We also visualize the spectrum by measuring the dynamical structure factor. A linearly-dispersing phonon mode materializes in the superfluid, appearing even when disorder is introduced to the clean Mott insulator. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for disorder-induced superfluidity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa Bakr, Robin Wopalenski</p>
            <p>Accurate extraction of linearized quantum circuit models from electromagnetic simulations is essential for the design of superconducting circuits. We present a quantization framework based on the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ seen by a Josephson junction embedded in an arbitrary passive linear environment. By taking the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, we show that the linearized coupled system obeys an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition, $s Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$, whose roots determine the dressed linear mode frequencies. This boundary condition admits an exact continued fraction representation: any positive-real admittance can be realized as a canonical Cauer ladder, yielding a tridiagonal (Jacobi) structure that enables certified convergence bounds via interlacing this http URL the full nonlinear Hamiltonian, we treat Josephson junctions in the charge basis, where each cosine potential is exactly tridiagonal, and couple them to cavity modes in the Fock basis; in the general multi-junction case this yields a block-tridiagonal structure solvable by matrix continued fractions, enabling systematic diagonalization across all coupling regimes from dispersive through ultrastrong and deep strong coupling. The resulting quantization procedure is: (i)~compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii)~solve the boundary condition to obtain dressed eigenfrequencies, (iii)~synthesize an equivalent passive network, and (iv)~quantize while retaining the full cosine nonlinearity of the Josephson junction. We prove that junction participation decays as $\mathcal{O}(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies for any circuit with finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative corrections without imposed cutoffs.</p>

            <p>Distinguishing an exciton condensate from an excitonic gas or insulator remains a fundamental challenge, as both phases feature bound electron-hole pairs but differ only by the emergence of macroscopic phase coherence. Here, we theoretically propose that a spin-orbit-coupled bilayer system can host a finite-momentum exciton condensate exhibiting a nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag -- the coherent-exciton diode effect. This effect arises from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries in the exciton condensate, resulting in direction-dependent critical counterflow currents. The resulting nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag provides a clear and unambiguous transport signature of phase-coherent exciton condensation, offering a powerful and experimentally accessible approach to identify, probe, and control exciton superfluidity in solid-state platforms.</p>

            <p>Measurement of light polarization has long been based on complex, bulk, and slow optical instruments. The advent of materials with in-situ variable polarization photoresponse has led to the concept of reconstructive polarimetry, where the detector itself plays the role of tunable polarizer. Materials enabling such functionality have been limited to complex van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate the reconstructive polarimetry with infrared (IR) detectors based on simple gated graphene-metal junctions. The reconstruction exploits the gate tuning of polarization contrast, which enables the evaluation of both infrared power and polarization angle from photovoltage measurements at two sequential gate voltages. The physics enabling the polarimetry lies in polarization-dependent shift of the electron hot spot near the contact, and the gate tuning of the of light-sensitive barrier width. We further show the universality of polarization reconstruction, i.e. its feasibility with different geometries of the junction, and with graphene of different quality, from hBN-encapsulated to the scalable vapor-deposited wet-transferred samples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Liu, Robert Dawson, Nathaniel Gabor, Vivek Aji</p>
            <p>The coupling of atomic vibrations to electronic excitations - traditionally understood to be a source of energy loss in semiconductors - has recently been explored in photosynthetic light harvesting as a means to circumvent dissipation by harnessing quantum vibronic coherence. Motivated by recent photocurrent measurements of vibronic sidebands in WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ optoelectronic devices, we present a nonperturbative theoretical framework for phonon-assisted absorption in van der Waals heterostructures. Using a polaron transformation, a closed-form expression for the optical absorption spectrum at arbitrary temperatures is presented. Our model includes both intraband and interband electron--phonon coupling. Detailed analysis shows that the observed periodic sidebands originate from the strong coupling between interlayer excitons and nearly dispersionless optical phonon modes. Comparing two limiting cases - one involving only intraband couplings, and another incorporating coherent interband processes - we show that interband phonon-assisted transitions are needed to account for the observed data. Beyond enabling the direct estimation of vibronic coupling strengths from spectroscopic data, these findings have profound consequences for our understanding of optical and optoelectronic responses: coherent interband coupling of atomic vibrations to excitons is essential to quantifying photoresponse in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We report robust room temperature interlayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures engineered via precise stacking orientation and twist-angle control. We integrate 2H-stacked MoSe$_{2}$/$^{1}$WSe$_{2}$/$^{2}$WSe$_{2}$ heterotrilayer onto a chirped distributed Bragg reflector that acts as a backside mirror. This way, we fabricate a platform that hosts distinct heterotrilayer, heterobilayer, and homobilayer regions with enhanced excitonic features at elevated temperatures. Although the heterobilayer supports temperature-tunable singlet and triplet interlayer excitons, it exhibits low emission yield at 4 K. In comparison, the heterotrilayer shows remarkable excitonic properties, including pronounced band modulation, intervalley interlayer exciton transitions, and a tenfold photoluminescence enhancement along with a sevenfold increase in exciton decay time at cryogenic temperatures compared to the heterobilayer system. Temperature-dependent studies reveal intriguing interlayer exciton dynamics in the heterotrilayer, including the emergence of valley-polarized interlayer excitons, and the ability to maintain optical stability up to room temperature. Our results establish a clear strategy for engineering excitonic states across multilayer van der Waals heterostructures from 4 K to room temperature, providing a versatile platform for excitonic optoelectronics, quantum photonics, and tunable long-lived interlayer exciton states in scalable TMD heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Topology and energy dependence of Majorana bound states in a photonic cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aksel Kobiałka, Arnob Kumar Ghosh, Rodrigo Arouca, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</p>
            <p>Light-matter interaction plays a crucial role in modifying the properties of quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the effect of cavity induced photon fields on a topological superconductor hosting Majorana bound states (MBS). We model the system using a Peierls substitution of the photonic operator in the kinetic and spin-orbit terms, and utilize an exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian for a finite number of photons to investigate the coupled system. We find that the MBS persist even in the presence of a cavity field and notably appear at finite and tunable energy, in contrast to a usual 1D topological superconductor. The MBS energy is shifted by two processes: the cavity photon energy adds a constant energy shift, while the light-matter interaction induces additional parameter dependencies, such that the MBS experience a pseudo-dispersion as a function of both light-matter interaction and magnetic field. Additionally, we find that the MBS energy oscillations are suppressed with increasing light-matter interaction and that disorder stability is not impacted by the light-matter interaction. Combined, these offer additional tunability and stability of the MBS. As a second result, we establish a modified spectral localizer formalism as an essential tool for topological characterization of quantum matter in a cavity. The spectral localizer allows characterization at arbitrary energies, which is needed for probing different photon sectors. However, hybridization between different photon sectors in the low-frequency regime limits a straightforward application of a standard spectral localizer. We fully resolve this issue by judiciously applying an energy shift to the spectral localizer. Our work thus introduces a new avenue for controlling MBS via light-matter coupling and provides a framework for exploring cavity-modified topologies.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast giant enhancement of second harmonic generation in a strongly correlated cobaltite</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Cui, Qiaomei Liu, Qiong Wu, Shuxiang Xu, Junhan Huang, Hao Wang, Rongsheng Li, Shanshan Han, Wei Xu, Li Du, Ming Lu, Chunmei Zhang, Shangfei Wu, Xinbo Wang, Tao Dong, Li Yue, Dong Wu, Nanlin Wang</p>
            <p>We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7. Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60 % higher than the initial value, then decays into a long-lived excited state maintaining the enhancement. The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification of electron correlations. Our findings open a new avenue for ultrafast optical control of nonlinear properties in strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <h2>Evolution of electronic and magnetic properties in Mn- and Co-alloyed ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2</h2>

            <p>Kagome metals are an intriguing class of quantum materials as the presence of both flat bands and Dirac points provides access to functional properties present in strongly correlated and topological materials. To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emilio N.M. Cirillo, Matteo Colangeli, Claudio Giberti, Lamberto Rondoni</p>
            <p>Inspired by recent studies on deterministic oscillator models, we introduce a stochastic one-dimensional model for a chain of interacting particles. The model consists of $N$ oscillators performing continuous-time random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with exponentially distributed waiting times. The oscillators are bound by confining forces to two particles that do not move, placed at positions $x_0$ and $x_{N+1}$, respectively, and they feel the presence of baths with given inverse temperatures: $\beta_L$ to the left, $\beta_B$ in the middle, and $\beta_R$ to the right. Each particle has an index and interacts with its nearest neighbors in index space through either a quadratic potential or a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type coupling. This local interaction in index space can give rise to effective long-range interactions on the spatial lattice, depending on the instantaneous configuration. Particle hopping rates are governed either by the Metropolis rule or by a modified version that breaks detailed balance at the interfaces between regions with different baths.</p>

            <h2>Opposite impact of thermal expansion and phonon anharmonicity on the phonon-limited resistivity of elemental metals from first principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ao Wang, Junwen Yin, Félix Antoine Goudreault, Michel Côté, Olle Hellman, Samuel Poncé</p>
            <p>Understanding electrical resistivity in metals remains a central challenge in quantifying charge transport at finite temperature. Current first-principles calculations based on the Boltzmann transport equation often match experiments, yet they almost always neglect the effect of thermal expansion and phonon anharmonicity. We show that both effects exert an opposite impact on electron-phonon coupling and on electrical resistivity. Thermal expansion enhances the coupling and leads to overestimation of resistivity, whereas anharmonic effects reduce it. By explicitly incorporating both effects, we establish a more complete description of resistivity in elemental metals, demonstrated here for Pb, Nb, and Al.</p>

            <h2>Efficient and tunable narrowband second-harmonic generation by a large-area etchless lithium niobate metasurface</h2>

            <p>Optical resonances in nanostructures enable strong enhancement of nonlinear processes at the nanoscale, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), with high-$Q$ modes providing intensified light--matter interactions and sharp spectral selectivity for applications in filtering, sensing, and nonlinear spectroscopy. Thanks to the recent advances in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology, these key features can be now translated to lithium niobate for realizing novel nanoscale nonlinear optical platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large-area metasurface, realized by scalable nanoimprint lithography, comprising a slanted titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) nanograting on etchless TFLN for efficient narrowband SHG. This is enabled by the optimal coupling of quasi-bound state in the continuum (q-BIC) modes with a narrowband pulsed laser pump. The demonstrated normalized SHG efficiency is $0.15\%\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{GW}$, which is among the largest reported for LN metasurfaces. The low pump peak intensity ($3.64~\mathrm{kW}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) employed, which enables SHG even by continuous-wave pumping, allows envisioning integrated and portable photonic applications. SHG wavelength tuning from $870$ to $920~\mathrm{nm}$ with stable output power as well as polarization control is also achieved by off-normal pump illumination. This versatile platform opens new opportunities for sensing, THz generation and detection, and ultrafast electro-optic modulation of nonlinear optical signals.</p>

            <h2>Topological Defects from Quantum Reset Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Jafari, Henrik Johannesson, Sebastian Eggert</p>
            <p>We analyze mechanisms for universal out-of-equilibrium dynamics near criticality by exploring the effect of randomized quantum resetting (QR) under a finite-time quench across a quantum phase transition. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a generic model and exploiting its exact solution, QR is found to cause a crossover of the scaling of the topological defect density with the time scale $\tau$ of the quench, from Kibble-Zurek to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling as $\tau$ increases. This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise.</p>

            <p>Polarization analysis in x-ray spectroscopy provides an orientation dependent sensitivity to local bonding environments. For a cluster of atoms, polarization sensitivity is most often discussed through the lens of point group symmetries. However, this is a discrete, qualitative method of classifying clusters, and it does little to indicate the degree of spectral anisotropy. Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF. We find that the model can strongly predict the degree of spectral anisotropy, with the primary factors being derived from the spatial moments of ligands in a cluster.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced detection of circularly polarized photons with topological materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamideh Sharifpour, George J. de Coster, Avik W. Ghosh</p>
            <p>Topological insulators (TI) are highly attractive platforms for next-generation optoelectronic and photonic devices. Spin-momentum locking of topological surface states enhance their nonlinear optical responses and sensitivities, especially to circularly polarized light. Until now, theoretical investigations of nonlinear responses in TIs have been limited to microscopic calculations on analytical continuum models, or leveraging density functional theory based Hamiltonians. In this work, we expand beyond these two approaches by employing a nonlinear Kubo formalism to calculate second-order nonlinear optical conductivity in a slab geometry using symmetry informed tight binding models that accurately reproduce the conduction, valence and topological surface bands in Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Our methodology enables us to study the layer resolved contribution to injection-currents coupled to the incident electric field. We demonstrate that our technique can reveal how device engineering modifies elements of the nonlinear optical response such as the circular photogalvanic effect by breaking inversion and time-reversal symmetry. We find, in line with experiments, that the photogalvanic current is sensitive to field effects, Fermi level energy, gate voltage and the energy of incident light. Our computed midwavelength infrared (mid-IR) responsivity $R \approx 0.169~\mathrm{\mu A/W}$ is comparable to reported TI and intrinsic 2D-material photodetectors. We further simulate experimentally unexplored methods to modify the circular photogalvanic effect such as proximitizing a magnetic field to one of the TI surface materials, suggesting a mechanism for optoelectronic tuning.</p>

            <p>The geometry and binding energy of excitons, set by electron-hole wavefunction distributions, are fundamental factors that underpin their many-body interactions and determine optoelectronic properties of semiconductors. However, in typical solid-state systems, these quantities are fixed by material composition and structure. Here we introduce a polarizable interlayer exciton hosted in a two-dimensional tetralayer heterostructure whose dipole length, in-plane radius, and binding energy can be continuously programmed in situ over a wide range, enabling direct control over the nature of excitonic many-body phase transitions. An out-of-plane electric field redistributes layer-hybridized electron-hole wavefunctions, realizing in situ control of exciton geometry through a strong quadratic Stark response. This tunability further regulates the nature of interaction-driven Mott transition, transforming it from gradual to abrupt. Our results establish exciton geometry as a continuously tunable materials parameter, opening routes to exciton-based quantum phase-transition simulators and guiding the design of emergent optoelectronic functionalities from programmable excitonic materials.</p>

            <p>Bimetallic catalysts provide new routes toward sustainable ammonia synthesis, but the structural dynamics controlling their performance under real-world conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine in situ gas-cell and multimodal electron microscopy to disentangle the temperature-, pressure-, and chemistry-dependent restructuring of AuRu catalysts, revealing pathways accessible only at atmospheric pressure. As synthesized, AuRu nanocatalysts are polycrystalline face-centered-cubic alloys with Au/Ru intermixing that phase-segregate into Au- and Ru-rich domains with elevated temperature (>450 °C). Increased pressure (~1 atm in 3:1, hydrogen:nitrogen) unlocks pronounced faceting and internal nanovoid formation, which systematic gas-chemistry variation identifies as hydrogen-driven. Density functional theory-based interatomic potentials show that hydrogen can amplify Au/Ru diffusion asymmetry, promoting nanovoid formation via a gas-mediated Kirkendall mechanism. Together, these results bridge the pressure gap between traditional in situ electron microscopy and benchtop ammonia reactors, enabling resolution of distinct restructuring stimuli in multicomponent systems.</p>

This particular superposition of field and strain, modeled in the continuum approximation by an effective gauge field, leads to an asymmetric pseudo-magnetic field at each Weyl node of opposite chirality. Therefore, we also studied the role of nodal asymmetry in the properties of the system by means of the Kadanoff-Wilson renormalization group and the corresponding flow equations. By solving those, we discuss the evolution of the coupling parameters of the theory, and analyze possible fixed points and lattice (Peierls) instabilities emerging from interactions between phonons with the chiral Landau level in the very strong pseudo-magnetic field regime.</p>

            <p>We propose a general class of open fermionic models where quadratic Liouvillians governing the dissipative dynamics feature exactly solvable higher-order exceptional points (EPs). Invoking the formalism of third quantization, we show that, among the multiple EPs of Liouvillian, an EP with its order approaching the system size arises as the quasisteady state of the system, leading to a gapless Liouvillian spectrum. By introducing perturbations, in the form of many-body quantum-jump processes, these higher-order EPs break down, leading to finite Liouvillian gaps with fractional power-law scalings. While the power-law scaling is a signature of the higher-order EP, its explicit form is sensitively dependent on the many-body perturbation. Finally, we discuss the steady-state approaching dynamic which can serve as detectable signals for the higher-order Liouvillian EPs.</p>

            <h2>Robust Machine Learning Framework for Reliable Discovery of High-Performance Half-Heusler Thermoelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoeb Athar, Adrien Mecibah, Philippe Jund</p>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) can facilitate efficient thermoelectric (TE) material discovery essential to address the environmental crisis. However, ML models often suffer from poor experimental generalizability despite high metrics. This study presents a robust workflow, applied to the half-Heusler (hH) structural prototype, for figure of merit (zT) prediction, to improve the generalizability of ML models. To resolve challenges in dataset handling and feature filtering, we first introduce a rigorous PCA-based splitting method that ensures training and test sets are unbiased and representative of the full chemical space. We then integrate Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with k-best feature filtering across three architectures-Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks - while employing SISSO symbolic regression for physical insight and comparison. Using SHAP and SISSO analysis, we identify A-site dopant concentration (xA'), and A-site Heat of Vaporization (HVA) as the primary drivers of zT besides Temperature (T). Finally, a high-throughput screening of approximately 6.6x10^8 potential compositions, filtered by stability constraints, yielded several novel high-zT candidates. Breaking from the traditional focus of improving test RMSE/R^2 values of the models, this work shifts the attention on establishing the test set a true proxy for model generalizability and strengthening the often neglected modules of the existing ML workflows for the data-driven design of next-generation thermoelectric materials.</p>

            <p>Engineering optical properties, such as luminescence purity and charge transfer, is crucial for harnessing the application potential of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). While electrostatic gating is widely applied to gain charge control in TMDC monolayers, charge transfer can also be engineered via coupling of TMDC monolayers at semiconductor III/V, organic, or van der Waals interfaces. This confers great advantages, such as ease in implementation and compatibility in device integration. Here, we shed light on the optical properties of many-particle complexes emerging at the GaInP/MoSe2 interface as a highly relevant material combination to manipulate the optical properties of TMDCs in integrated photonic devices. Our study verifies its nature as a type II hetero-interface, which bears the feasibility to display disorder-free photoluminescence. Through optical absorption measurements, we verify that the charged complexes acquire substantial oscillator strength. Furthermore, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, supported by a microscopic theory framework, evidences the suppression of the characteristic carrier recoil effect that was previously observed in the photoluminescence of trions in TMDCs. These phenomena allow us to identify the optical signatures at the TMDC-GaInP interface as Fermi polaron quasiparticle resonances, which are of high importance in researching Bose-Fermi mixtures in condensed matter systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yilun Gao, Alberto Rodríguez, Rudolf A. Römer</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body systems pose a formidable computational challenge due to the exponential growth of their Hilbert space. While machine learning (ML) has shown promise as an alternative paradigm, most applications remain at the proof-of-concept stage, focusing narrowly on energy estimation at the lower end of the spectrum. Here, we push ML beyond this frontier by extensively testing HubbardNet, a deep neural network architecture for the Bose-Hubbard model. Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes. Together, these results suggest ML as a viable qualitative predictor of many-body structure, complementing the quantitative strengths of exact diagonalization and tensor-network methods.</p>

            <p>Quantum geometry, encoded in the Berry curvature and quantum metric, has unified diverse anomalous transport phenomena in solids, yet a microscopic quantum-geometric theory of entropy transport for Bloch electrons is still lacking. We formulate an entropy continuity equation for noninteracting fermions driven by an electric field, starting from the von Neumann entropy, and obtain quantum-mechanical expressions for the entropy current density and entropy production rate. Introducing relaxation through a relaxation-time dissipator, we identify the quantum metric as the origin of the leading entropy production, providing a direct microscopic diagnostic of dissipation in both the extrinsic Drude response and an intrinsic nonlinear Ohmic contribution controlled by quantum metric. We further predict an entropy Hall effect arising from the Berry curvature and show that it obeys an Onsager reciprocal relation with the anomalous Nernst effect under a temperature gradient. Finally, we establish universal relations connecting entropy and charge currents under DC and AC driving, offering experimentally accessible probes of quantum geometry through nonequilibrium entropy flow.</p>

            <p>We introduce a one-dimensional non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with staggered imbalance in the $p$-wave superconducting pairing. By tuning the chemical potential and the pairing imbalance, we find that the eigenenergy spectrum undergoes real-to-complex transitions, and the spectral gap can change from a real to an imaginary line gap. The pairing imbalance significantly enlarges the parameter region supporting a topological superconducting phase. Remarkably, we show that a topologically nontrivial phase hosting Majorana zero modes can be induced by varying the pairing imbalance, even in the regime of strong chemical potential. The gap-closing points and phase boundaries are determined analytically, and the resulting phase diagrams are characterized by a nonzero topological invariant. Furthermore, we identify the existence of Majorana zero modes and finite-energy Majorana edge modes in this system. Our results reveal exotic phenomena arising from imbalanced pairing and establish a new platform for exploring topological superconductivity in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We present a fully atomistic approach to exciton-phonon coupling in semiconductor quantum dots that bridges microscopic electronic-structure calculations with non-Markovian open-quantum-system dynamics. On the example of an InAsP quantum dot embedded in an InP matrix, we compute single-particle states using an ab initio-parametrized tight-binding model, then obtain correlated many-body wave functions of neutral excitons, biexcitons, and charged trions via the configuration-interaction method. Using these correlated states, we compute the exciton-phonon coupling matrix elements. The resulting phonon spectral densities for different excitonic complexes are compared with the widely used analytical super-Ohmic form and reveal deviations at higher energies originating from the realistic dot geometry and atomistic wave functions, whereas configuration mixing is found to play only a minor role. Furthermore, we extract radiative lifetimes comparable to values experimentally measured. As a direct application, we simulate the emission brightness of a pulsed-driven quantum dot and demonstrate that the atomistically derived spectral density substantially broadens the region of efficient off-resonant excitation compared to the analytical model. The presented framework provides a nearly parameter-free route to simulate the non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

            <p>This text revisits the origins of econophysics through the figure of Benoît Mandelbrot, not as the father of fractals, but as the instigator of a distinctive scientific posture. The guiding thread is methodological: accept the stubborn features of the data and use models as instruments for intuition rather than as axiomatic certificates of truth. In this perspective, scaling, intermittency and extremes are not peripheral imperfections around a well-behaved equilibrium; they are the very texture of economic and financial fluctuations. This naturally shifts attention from exogenous narratives to endogenous dynamics: interactions, feedback loops, and collective amplification mechanisms that can make systems intrinsically {\it fragile}. We argue that the importation of concepts from statistical physics -- criticality, disorder, emergence, multiplicative cascades -- should be read not as an artificial transposition but as a candid attempt to look for generic mechanisms compatible with empirical regularities observed across scales, from markets to macroeconomic aggregates.</p>

In this work, we are motivated to investigate the nonlinear Thouless pumping in a non-Hermitian and nonlinear Rice-Mele model. In particular, we uncover how non-Hermiticity parameters can induce fractional topological phases--even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the framework of the equation of auxiliary eigenvalues, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K.K. Grigoryan, M.M. Glazov</p>
            <p>The theory of inter-spin-subband electric dipole spin resonance in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers is proposed. Our symmetry analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to monolayers, the reduced symmetry of heterobilayers enables coupling between conduction band spin subbands by an electric field. We establish the optical selection rules for all six high-symmetry stacking configurations. The microscopic mechanism of the effect is identified as the spin-orbit coupling induced mixing of Bloch states from different conduction bands, which generates a non-zero momentum matrix element between the spin-split states. It also leads to the linear-in-wavevector spin-dependent terms in the effective Hamiltonian, i.e., the Rashba effect. Our estimates show that the rate of electric-dipole spin-flip transitions exceeds by far that of the magnetic-dipole transitions in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers.</p>

            <h2>Machine-Learned Hamiltonians for Quantum Transport Simulation of Valence Change Memories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Hao Xia, Manasa Kaniselvan, Marko Mladenoivić, Mathieu Luisier</p>
            <p>The construction of the Hamiltonian matrix \textbf{H} is an essential, yet computationally expensive step in \textit{ab-initio} device simulations based on density-functional theory (DFT). In homogeneous structures, the fact that a unit cell repeats itself along at least one direction can be leveraged to minimize the number of atoms considered and the calculation time. However, such an approach does not lend itself to amorphous or defective materials for which no periodicity exists. In these cases, (much) larger domains containing thousands of atoms might be needed to accurately describe the physics at play, pushing DFT tools to their limit. Here we address this issue by learning and directly predicting the Hamiltonian matrix of large structures through equivariant graph neural networks and so-called augmented partitioning training. We demonstrate the strength of our approach by modeling valence change memory (VCM) cells, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.39 to 3.58 meV, as compared to DFT, when predicting the Hamiltonian matrix entries of systems made of $\sim$5,000 atoms. We then replace the DFT-computed Hamiltonian of these VCMs with the predicted one to compute their energy-resolved transmission function with a quantum transport tool. A qualitatively good agreement between both sets of curves is obtained. Our work provides a path forward to overcome the memory and computational limits of DFT, thus enabling the study of large-scale devices beyond current \textit{ab-initio} capabilities</p>

            <p>Unraveling the interplay between density-wave (DW) instabilities and multi-orbital physics is critical for understanding superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, yet intrinsic electronic features have been persistently obscured by material inhomogeneity and thus the multi-domain averaging effect. Here, we employ micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ($\mu$-ARPES) on single-domain Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ to disentangle the complex hierarchy of intrinsic and back-folded bands, explicitly identifying the electronic states driving the DW phase transition. We provide decisive spectroscopic evidence that the low-energy reconstruction is governed by inter-orbital nesting between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands. Specifically, we resolve a orbital-dependent gap of $\sim44$ meV on the $\alpha$ pocket, a value quantitatively consistent with prior measurements, unifying previously conflicting experimental reports regarding the locus and magnitude of the DW gap. Furthermore, we reveal strong orbital-selective mass renormalization in the $d_{z^2}$ states and successfully resolve the long-sought intrinsic trilayer $\beta$-band splitting, establishing a critical lower bound for the outer-layer hopping. These results define a coherent microscopic fingerprint for the trilayer nickelates, identifying the specific nesting channels and correlation effects that underpin the phase diagram.</p>

            <p>We examine nonlinear transport in a viscous two-dimensional electron fluid within narrow GaAs channels. The differential magnetoresistance shows nonmonotonic behavior, a signature of electron pairing in the hydrodynamic regime. Theoretical models that account for both the influence of these interactions on shear stress relaxation and viscosity changes from electron heating show good agreement with the data. The nonlinear regime thus reveals how such correlated states govern the hydrodynamic behavior of the electron fluid. Our findings establish the nonlinear transport regime as a powerful probe for dissecting the complex interplay of correlated electron states and momentum relaxation in the hydrodynamic flow of an electron fluid.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sylvia J. Bintrim, Ella R. Ransford, Kevin Carter-Fenk</p>
            <p>"Addition-by-subtraction" coupled cluster (CC) approaches provide a promising approach to treating the difficult strong correlation problem by simplifying the standard CC equations. In a separate vein, linearized CC methods have drawn interest for their lower computational cost, increased parallelizability, and favorable properties for extension to the excited state--but the inclusion of ring/crossed-ring terms causes singularities even for single bond breaking. A linearized, addition-by-subtraction CC method called linearized ladder CCD (linLCCD) removes these terms to avoid divergences, but linLCCD under-estimates dynamical correlation. Herein we resolve this deficiency of linLCCD by introducing a linearized external coupled cluster perturbation theory that adds a second-order ring/crossed-ring correction back into a linLCCD reference wave function. Our resultant xlinCCD(2) method is regular and yields comparable results to linearized CCD in weakly-correlated regimes.</p>

            <p>Resolving where the density-wave gap opens in momentum space is essential for identifying the microscopic origin of the instability in layered nickelates. Using polarization-resolved electronic Raman scattering, we map the momentum selectivity of the spin-density-wave (SDW) gap in trilayer La4Ni3O10. We observe a SDW-induced redistribution of spectral weight on both the $\alpha$ pocket at the Brillouin-zone centre and a portion of the $\beta$ pocket near the zone boundary, characterized by gap energies of approximately 55~meV. In contrast, no comparable spectral weight suppression is observed along the diagonal region of $\beta$ pockets, implying little or no gap opening. This gap topology contrasts sharply with that in La3Ni2O7, where anisotropic SDW gaps open solely on the $\beta$ pocket. Our results establish a distinct momentum-space gap topology between bilayer and trilayer nickelates, placing new constraints on the ordering wave vector and the mechanism of the density-wave instability relevant to superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan-Hao Yang, Zhihao Xu, Lei Ying, Qizhong Zhu</p>
            <p>We study localization driven solely by interparticle interactions in moiré lattice systems without intrinsic disorder or externally imposed quasiperiodic potentials. We consider a one-dimensional bilayer with incommensurate lattice constants, described by a spin-dependent Fermi-Hubbard-type model with short-range interlayer interactions, where quasiperiodicity emerges only through interactions. Exact diagonalization shows that quenching hopping in one layer generates an interaction-induced mosaic potential with multiple mobility edges. When both layers are dynamical, increasing interlayer interactions drives transitions among ergodic, critical, and many-body localized regimes, with energy-dependent coexistence in certain parameter ranges. An exact mapping to a noninteracting single-particle model on a higher-dimensional structured graph provides a unified interpretation of these results and suggests an experimentally accessible route to interaction-induced moiré physics and localization.</p>

            <h2>Triplet Envelope Functions for increasing machine learning interatomic potential efficiency and stability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emil Annevelink, Varun Shankar</p>
            <p>Central to interatomic potential efficiency is the radial envelope function that enables linear scaling with computational cost by defining a local neighborhood of atoms. This has enabled MLIPs to revolutionize materials science over the past decade by providing DFT accuracy with linear scaling computational cost in molecular dynamics workflows. However, MLIPs still have a relatively high computational cost compared to empirical interatomic potentials, preventing them from transforming molecular dynamics workflows. A central issue is that MLIPs use relatively large cutoff radii, converging to 6A over the last few years. The large cutoffs prioritize accuracy of any material over efficiency in any particular region of phase space, capturing dispersion effects and low density materials at the expense of increased computational cost in higher density materials. Past work has aimed to address this with KNN graph sparsification, which, while significantly reducing cost, has the drawback of breaking energy conservation. In this work, we propose higher-order envelope functions that prune local atomic neighborhoods through physically inspired geometric functions to provide the memory and efficiency benefits of KNN graph sparsification while eliminating non-conservative energy dynamics. Through numerical experiments on solids and liquids with 5-8A cutoffs, we show that triplet envelope functions complement radial envelope functions by doubling training and inference speed, tripling memory efficiency, and increasing simulation stability while not impacting accuracy or data efficiency for the most common 6A cutoff. Moreover, experiments with 8A radial cutoffs show triplet envelope functions create a pathway to larger cutoff radii for efficiently and accurately modeling open structures with large interatomic distances, showing a promising new direction for engineering MLIP efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijith S Parackal, Rickard Armiento, Florian Trybel</p>
            <p>Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a standard method for DFT-level accurate molecular dynamics simulation and large-scale studies of crystal energetics. Increasingly popular are universal pre-trained potentials, also called foundation models, based one, e.g. the MACE, CHGNet, M3GNet, ORB, and SevenNet architectures. While there are many benchmarks of these models using validation errors and materials discovery tasks, their fidelity in reproducing the detailed features of potential energy surfaces (PES) is not understood to the same degree. We evaluate the accuracy of these potentials by systematically probing their predicted energy landscapes. Two-dimensional slices of the potential energy surface are constructed where the atomic positions are varied along selected Wyckoff degrees of freedom within a fixed crystal symmetry. This approach enables a direct, visual comparison of the interatomic potentials and DFT-calculated surfaces which reveals potential artifacts e.g., arising from unique local environments. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of different potentials in capturing local minima, saddle points, and overall PES topology, offering insights into the physical accuracy of current pre-trained IAPs and providing benchmarks for future model development.</p>

            <p>Integrable quantum many-body systems host families of extensive conservation laws, some of which are fragile: even infinitesimal perturbations can qualitatively alter their dynamical constraints. Here we show that this fragility leaves a clear experimental fingerprint in a one-dimensional quantum spin chain of as few as 14 Rydberg atoms. Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observables. In particular, magnetization fluctuations are highly sensitive to the breaking of fragile conservation laws and exhibit anomalous growth, which we observe experimentally; similar signatures appear in a semilocal string observable. Numerical simulations on substantially longer chains and a simplified classical stochastic model reproduce those features. We establish non-local observables as a sensitive probe of fragile conservation laws in quantum spin chains and Rydberg-atom arrays as a platform to test perturbative descriptions of quantum many-body dynamics with weak integrability breaking.</p>

Using scanning SQUID, we image the local susceptibility in a hybrid Josephson junction array. On a square lattice of narrow islands, we simultaneously access both the amplitude and spatial phase structure of sensitive superconducting states. We observe periodic phase patterns at commensurate magnetic fillings. At zero field the long-range phase coherence is strongest. At a finite field, smaller than one percent of flux quantum per unit cell, the system fragments into large regions of constant superconducting phase, as a function of the applied field. Our results provide the first direct measurement of long-range phase coherence in a Josephson junction array.</p>

            <p>Spin defects in two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for quantum information technologies and sensing applications. The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has attracted considerable attention as a quantum sensor due to its demonstrated sensitivity to temperature, magnetic fields, and pressure.1 However, its applications have thus far been limited by inherently dim photoluminescence (PL). By fabricating a van der Waals heterostructure with a sensitizing donor layer, lead iodide (PbI2), we effectively enhance the PL intensity from the VB- by 5-45x, while maintaining compatibility with other heterostructures and vdW optoelectronic platforms. The type-I band alignment at the heterojunction enables efficient exciton migration while suppressing back-electron transfer, and the strong spectral overlap between the PbI2 emission and defect absorption supports efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) predicts a photon-ratcheting mechanism that boosts absorption and emission while maintaining magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast through minimal hybridization. Experimentally, the heterostructure exhibits enhanced continuous-wave ODMR sensitivity and functions as a precise probe of external magnetic fields. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for amplifying weak defect signals in nanomaterials, highlighting a new strategy for engineering their optical and magnetic responses.</p>

            <p>The strange metal remains one of the great unsolved problems for 21st century science. Since the early development of the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology, it has been clear that progress requires detailed knowledge of the momentum- and frequency-dependent charge susceptibility, $\chi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$, particularly at large momenta. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), performed in either reflection or transmission geometry, provides the most direct probe of $\chi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$. However, measurements over the past four decades have yielded conflicting results, with some studies reporting a dispersing RPA-like plasmon and others observing a strongly overdamped, incoherent response. Here we report a transmission EELS study of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) that simultaneously achieves high energy resolution ($\Delta E \approx 30$ meV) and high momentum resolution ($\Delta q \approx 0.01$ Å$^{-1}$). To address issues of reproducibility, measurements were repeated ten times on five different Bi-2212 flakes, benchmarked against aluminum, a well-characterized Fermi liquid, and quantitatively compared with prior studies spanning four decades. At momenta $q < 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, we observe a highly damped plasmon whose linewidth is comparable to its energy. At larger momenta, $q > 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, this excitation does not disperse but instead evolves into an incoherent continuum, with no evidence for the RPA-like dispersion reported in some earlier works. Comparison with recent RIXS measurements on Bi-based cuprates supports the view that Bi-2212 is an incoherent metal with strongly damped charge excitations.</p>

            <h2>Mechanics of incompatible asymmetric grain boundary migration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon Runnels</p>
            <p>Grain boundary (GB) migration governs microstructure evolution and can mediate plastic deformation through sliding or shear coupling. Numerous experimental and numerical studies have reported a wide range of behaviors associated with boundary migration, such as defect emission or mode switching. Notably, recent studies have reported directionally asymmetric migration rates under symmetric loading, attributing this behavior to intrinsically asymmetric mobility; however, a mechanistic mesoscale explanation for this behavior remains lacking. In this work, we introduce a constitutive flow rule for grain-boundary eigendeformation within a multiphase-field framework, in which interfacial shear evolves in response to its mechanically conjugate driving force through the phase field Allen-Cahn equations. The formulation systematically employs regularized grain boundary shear kinematics informed by crystallography, and enables elastic compatibility to modulate boundary motion. Migration thresholds, residual back-stress, and apparent directional asymmetry appear naturally as emergent mechanical behavior. Simulations of symmetric and asymmetric tilt grain boundaries under mechanical, synthetic, and curvature-driven loading reveal persistent defect-like residuals following incompatible migration, transitions from planar motion to lamination at large inclinations, and even "ratcheting" behavior. These results provide a mechanically transparent explanation for behaviors such as effective mobility asymmetry and establish elastic compatibility as a constitutive mechanism in mesoscale models of boundary-mediated plasticity.</p>

            <p>Electrical conductivity is the most fundamental charge transport parameter, and measurements of conductivity are a basic part of materials characterization for nearly all conducting materials. In thin films, conductivity is often measured in four bar architectures in which the current source and voltage measurement are spatially separated to eliminate systematic error due to contact resistance. Despite the apparent simplicity of these measurements, we demonstrate here that the four bar architecture is subject to significant systematic error arising from the finite conductivity of the metal electrodes. Remarkably, these systematic errors can in some cases become unbounded, producing arbitrarily high measured conductivity at modest true film conductivities, within the range relevant to emerging thin film thermoelectric materials such as conducting polymers. These unbounded errors, which can occur even in properly conducted four-point measurements of patterned films, likely explain literature reports of extremely high conductivities in conducting polymers, and can lead to anomalous scaling in temperature dependent studies, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of the relevant charge transport mechanism. We characterize the device geometric factors that control these errors, which stand partially at odds with those required for accurate Seebeck coefficient measurements. Our analyses allow us to identify device architectures that provide small systematic errors for conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while still providing a low measurement resistance, critical to reducing noise in thermal voltage measurements. These findings provide important guidelines for accurate measurements in the growing field of thin-film thermoelectric materials.</p>

While a sharp gapped plasma mode exists deep in the CFL phase, we demonstrate that it is damped near the proposed continuous phase transition between CFL and FL. This plasmon-damping phenomenon originates from emergent gauge fields and a Dirac-fermion-like spectrum. Similar features also occur in other continuous deconfined topological phase transitions, such as the Laughlin to superfluid transition in a bosonic system. In particular, this damping behavior extends over a finite range across the phase boundary, and, hence, we expect it to persist even when the transition is weakly first-order. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haotian Zhou, Yuli Lyanda-Geller</p>
            <p>Experiments suggest that nuclear spins play a significant role in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) near integer and fractional QHE spin transitions, but many of these phenomena still remain to be understood. Here we study theoretically the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in the two-dimensional electron liquid near a quantum point contact (QPC) or a domain wall between spin polarized and unpolarized phases induced by electrostatic gating in the fractional QHE at a filling factor 2/3 and analyze the dependence of the spin transition on temperature and the magnitude of the flowing current. We demonstrate that nearly all nuclear spins in the QPC or in the domain wall can be polarized by the electric current. The Overhauser effective magnetic field from the DNP can be strong enough to induce (or modify) a phase transition between polarized and unpolarized phases. This changes the gate voltages and magnetic fields required for the spin transitions, and leads to the reconstruction of the boundary between two phases and a domain wall and a current path displacement. The spread of nuclear spin polarization and the domain wall displacement are strongly asymmetric with respect to the direction of the current flow. Equilibration due to hyperfine interactions and its role on the nuclear spin polarization, domain wall displacements and spin transitions is studied. Back and forth oscillatory transitions between polarized and unpolarized phases near a source contact are discussed. Hyperfine interactions of nuclear spins provide a route for observation and control of the parafermion zero modes that can be induced when the domain wall between the polarized and unpolarized regions is placed in the proximity of a superconductor</p>

            <h2>Renewal theory for a run-and-tumble particle with stochastic resetting and a sticky boundary</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul C Bressloff, Samantha Linn</p>
            <p>We consider a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) with stochastic resetting confined to the half line $[0,\infty)$ with a sticky boundary at $x=0$. In the bulk the RTP tumbles at a constant rate $\alpha>0$ between velocity states $\pm v$ with $v>0$ and randomly resets to its initial position and orientation $(x_0,k_0)\in(\mathbb{R}^+,\pm)$. When the RTP reaches the target at $x=0$ it attaches to the boundary for a random waiting time before either detaching and continuing to navigate the bulk domain or (permanently) entering the target. These events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption, and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. We use renewal theory to characterize the particle trajectory in terms of successive binding events under two distinct desorption protocols: via resetting to $(x_0,k_0)$ and via continuous movement from $x=0$ with velocity $+v$. First we derive the nonequilibrum stationary state (NESS) in the case of no absorption and characterize the accumulation at the boundary. Second, we compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) statistics. In addition to observing the usual unimodal dependence of the MFPT on bulk resetting, both the NESS and MFPT strongly depend on the initial orientation $k_0$ and the desorption protocol. For instance, if the initial orientation is toward the boundary, we find that the desorption-induced resetting protocol can reduce the MFPT more effectively than the non-resetting desorption protocol. We also show how matching the desorption kinetics with the bulk resetting or tumbling rate introduces a trade-off between minimizing the adsorption and absorption times. In this setting we find that the desorption protocol which minimizes the absorption MFPT for a given set of parameters is almost always the opposite of that favored when desorption and bulk kinetics are not the same.</p>

The method circumvents the exponential complexity (\(4^{N}\)) of the canonical ensemble partition function by iteratively constructing finite magnetic clusters of size \(N_g\), where the effective spin state of a site in generation \(g+1\) is determined by the local magnetization of a cluster from generation \(g\). This approach, which shares conceptual ground with effective field theories, allows the study of systems of effectively very large size \(N = N_0 (N_g)^{g}\). We apply the formalism to the ferromagnetic spin-3/2 Ising model on a honeycomb lattice, modeling the monolayer CrI$_3$, a prototypical two-dimensional Ising magnet. The model, calibrated using the experimental transition temperature (\(T_{c} \simeq 45\) K), successfully reproduces key experimental features: the temperature dependence of the magnetization \(m(T)\), including its inflection point, and the broadened peak in the specific heat \(c_v(T)\). We also compute the entropy \(s(T)\), finding a finite residual value at low temperatures consistent with the system's double degeneracy. Our results demonstrate that this hierarchical cluster method provides a quantitatively accurate and computationally efficient framework for studying complex magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Frequency Stability of Graphene Nonlinear Parametric Oscillator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enise Kartal, Oriel Shoshani, Elena Botnaru, Alberto Martín-Pérez, Tomás Manzaneque, Farbod Alijani</p>
            <p>High-frequency stability is crucial for the performance of graphene resonators in sensing and timekeeping applications. However, the extreme miniaturization and high mechanical compliance that make graphene attractive also render it highly susceptible to nonlinearities, degrading frequency stability. Here, we demonstrate that graphene parametric oscillators provide an alternative nonlinear operating regime, where short-term frequency stability can be enhanced despite strong nonlinearity. By operating graphene resonators in a phase-locked loop (PLL), we experimentally demonstrate that parametric oscillations in the post-bifurcation regime achieve lower Allan deviation at fast integration times than Duffing oscillations at identical amplitudes. This improvement originates from strong nonlinear damping inherent to parametric oscillators, which suppresses amplitude-to-frequency noise conversion at large amplitudes. A minimal theoretical model captures observed phase diffusion and identifies nonlinear damping as the dominant mechanism governing phase noise reduction. These results highlight the role of nonlinear dissipation in enabling precision sensing beyond conventional limits of graphene oscillators.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Magnetization of Interacting Electrons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi Chen, Zhi-Da Song</p>
            <p>We derive an exact expression for the orbital magnetization of electrons with short-range interactions (such as density-density interactions) in terms of exact zero-frequency response functions of the zero-field system. The result applies to weakly and strongly correlated electrons at zero and finite temperature, provided that the local grand potential density only depends on local thermodynamic parameters. We benchmark the formula for non-interacting and weakly-coupled electrons. To zeroth and first orders in the interaction strength, it agrees with the modern theory of orbital magnetization and its recent generalization to self-consistent Hartree-Fock bands. Our work provides an exact framework of interacting orbital magnetization beyond mean-field treatments, and paves the way for quantitative studies of strongly correlated electrons in external magnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Visualizing the Odd-parity Superconducting Order Parameter and its Quasiparticle Surface Band in UTe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuqiu Wang, J.C. Séamus Davis</p>
            <p>A distinctive identifier of nodal intrinsic topological superconductivity (ITS) would the appearance of an Andreev bound state on crystal surfaces parallel to the nodal axis, in the form of a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) appearing only for $T < T_C$. Moreover, theory shows that specific QSB characteristics observable in tunneling to an s-wave superconductor can distinguish between chiral and non-chiral ITS order parameter $\Delta_k$. To search for such phenomena in $\text{UTe}_2$, s-wave superconductive scan-tip scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging was employed. It reveals an intense zero-energy Andreev conductance maximum at the $\text{UTe}_2$ (0-11) crystal termination. Development of the zero-energy Andreev conductance peak into two finite-energy particle-hole symmetric conductance maxima as the tunnel barrier is reduced, then signifies that $\text{UTe}_2$ superconductivity is non-chiral. Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) for an ITS material should be dominated by the QSB for energies within the superconductive energy gap $|E| \le \Delta$, so that bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics of the ITS can only be detected excursively. Again using a superconducting scan-tip, the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of the QSB of $\text{UTe}_2$ were visualized. Specifically, a band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears as a characteristic sextet $q_i$ :$i = 1-6$ of interference wavevectors showing that QSB dispersions $k(E)$ occur only for energies $|E| \le \Delta_{max}$ and only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. In combination, these phenomena are consistent with a bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibiting spin triplet, time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, $B_{3u}$ symmetry in $\text{UTe}_2$.</p>

            <h2>Information Propagation and Encoding in Solids: A Quantitative Approach Towards Mechanical Intelligence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peerasait Prachaseree, Emma Lejeune</p>
            <p>Engineered systems typically separate mechanical function from information processing, whereas biological systems can exploit physical structure as a medium for information processing and computation. Motivated by this contrast, recent work in mechanics has explored embedding information-processing capabilities directly into mechanical structures. However, quantitative frameworks for evaluating such capabilities remain limited. Here we address a foundational question: how does information propagate through a solid body? Using elastic bodies as a model system, we apply information-theoretic tools to treat an elastic domain as an information encoder and quantify how information transmits from applied loads to discrete sensor locations. We further connect these measures to familiar mechanical phenomena, including Saint-Venant's effect and principal stress lines. Moving toward design, we show how geometry and architected materials can tune transmission, enabling elastic domains to either transmit or block information. Overall, this work advances quantifiable metrics and benchmark tasks for mechanical intelligence, supporting comparable designs of mechanically embodied information processing.</p>

            <p>Scaffolds have a key role in the clinical success of tissue engineering for the regeneration of damaged tissues. Their bio-performance is often described as the extent to which they can provide an extracellular matrix-like environment for cells embedded where their function and growth can effectively continue. For this purpose, tissue engineering scaffolds should exhibit biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, delivery, and mechanical performance. The use of polymer coatings, especially poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), on tissue engineering scaffolds has been found to be one of the most effective methods to improve the scaffold properties. This paper reviews the techniques used to coat tissue engineering scaffolds with PLGA and its effects on the mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, biocompatibility, Molecular delivery, and osteointegration of the scaffolds. It is concluded that apart from apatite-formation ability, all bio-functionalities can be tuned through PLGA coatings. This reflects the great potential of this modification approach to be used in tissue regeneration and therapeutic delivery applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranay Nayak, Sreenath K. Manikandan, Tan Van Vu, Supriya Krishnamurthy</p>
            <p>Standard treatments of quantum work using projective energy measurements erase initial coherence and alter the dynamics, thereby failing to capture the thermodynamic effects of coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates in an ensemble of initial states. In this article, we use an operational work definition that is non-intrusive, applying it to the case of a driven dissipative qubit, where the qubit's initial preparation comprises coherent superposition states, while the driving is coherence-less. We derive an evolution equation for the moment generating function for this work, faithfully capturing the thermodynamic signature of coherent superpositions in the initial ensemble. We demonstrate that different initial ensembles that correspond to the same density matrix upon ensemble average, while having the same average work, display different work fluctuations. For monotonic driving, we show that fluctuations are maximum for coherence-less initial ensembles. As an application, we consider quantum bit-erasure in finite time and demonstrate significantly different work statistics for erasing a classical bit of information versus a Haar random initial ensemble. Our results indicate that coherence in the initial ensemble can be utilized as a resource for thermodynamic precision without incurring additional dissipative work costs. We also obtain a generalized fluctuation theorem that establishes a new quantum lower bound on the mean dissipated work. This bound, counterintuitively, is also applicable to a "classical" initial ensemble with the same initial density matrix and is connected to quantum absolute irreversibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Lumia, Emanuele Tirrito, Mario Collura, Fabian H.L. Essler, Rosario Fazio</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems can be described by unraveling Lindblad master equations into ensembles of quantum trajectories. Here we investigate how the complexity of such trajectories is affected by conservation laws and other dynamical constraints of the underlying Lindblad evolution. We characterize this complexity using a data-driven approach based on the intrinsic dimension, defined as the minimal number of variables required to encode the information contained in a data set. Applying this framework to several systems, including dissipative variants of the quantum top and of the XXZ chain, we find that the intrinsic dimension is sensitive to the structure of their dynamics. The Lindblad evolution in these systems is typically chaotic, but additional constraints arise at specific parameter values, where the dynamics becomes integrable, exhibits Hilbert-space fragmentation, or develops a closed BBGKY hierarchy, leading to pronounced minima in the intrinsic dimension. Our approach results in an unsupervised probe of the complexity of dissipative quantum systems that is sensitive to chaos and ergodicity breaking phenomena beyond the initial transient regime.</p>

            <p>Fermionic non-Gaussianity quantifies a quantum state's deviation from a classically tractable free-fermionic description, constituting a necessary resource for computational quantum advantage. Here we use fermionic antiflatness (FAF) to measure this deviation across ergodic and many-body localized (MBL) regimes. We focus on the paradigmatic disordered spin-$1\!/2$ XXZ chain and its impurity variant with local interactions. Across highly excited eigenstates, FAF evolves from typical-state behavior at weak disorder to strongly suppressed values deep in the MBL regime, with volume-law scaling in the XXZ chain and an area-law bound in the impurity setting. Rare long range catlike eigenstates exhibit a pronounced enhancement of FAF, making it a sensitive diagnostic of mechanisms proposed to destabilize MBL. Starting from product states, we find that in the MBL regime FAF grows slowly in time, approaching saturation via a power-law relaxation. Overall, our results show that MBL suppresses fermionic non-Gaussianity, and the associated complexity beyond free fermions, while ergodicity restores it, motivating explorations of fermionic non-Gaussianity in other ergodicity-breaking phenomena.</p>

Specifically, we show that the quantum Feynman measure transforms into the stochastic Wiener measure. Applying this framework to the Wigner function representation, we show that the system follows a stochastic path interpretable via classical probability theory.

            <p>Correlated microwave photon sources are key enablers for technologies in quantum-limited sensing, signal amplification and communication, but the reliance on millikelvin operating temperature limits their scalability for broader applications. Here, at room temperature, we demonstrate strong correlated microwave signals emitted from a hybrid magnon-photon platform. Different from traditional parametrically induced magnons with degenerate frequencies, we achieve non-degenerate excitations by coupling magnon modes simultaneously with two cavity photon modes. Through the magnon-photon interactions in the corresponding linear and nonlinear regimes, one input microwave photon splits into a pair of magnon polaritons that possess distinct frequencies but maintain strong inter-mode correlations. The nonlinear magnon polariton dynamics empowered by this new parametric platform brings both verified true randomness and robust multi-channel correlations, from which we construct a microwave communication experiment for noise resilient signal transmission with added security. This work establishes cavity magnonics as a versatile and compact platform for generating correlated multi-mode microwave signals, opening new avenues for applications in classical and quantum domains.</p>

            <p>We propose a data-driven heuristic for NP-hard Ising and Max-Cut optimization that learns the update rule of an iterative dynamical system. The method learns a shared, node-wise update rule that maps local interaction fields to spin updates, parameterized by a compact multilayer perceptron with a small number of parameters. Training is performed using a zeroth-order optimizer, since backpropagation through long, recurrent Ising-machine dynamics leads to unstable and poorly informative gradients. We call this approach a neural network parameterized Ising machine (NPIM). Despite its low parameter count, the learned dynamics recover effective algorithmic structure, including momentum-like behavior and time-varying schedules, enabling efficient search in highly non-convex energy landscapes. Across standard Ising and neural combinatorial optimization benchmarks, NPIM achieves competitive solution quality and time-to-solution relative to recent learning-based methods and strong classical Ising-machine heuristics.</p>

            <p>Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure-based energy decomposition analysis (EDA) are employed to connect hydrogen bond (H-bond) strength, its asymmetry, and the total delocalization energy at the water/air interface to experimentally measurable observables, such as the reorientation dynamics and the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrum. Using SFG spectra for distinct layers at the water/air interface, we validate the accuracy of our simulations and report a red-shift from the interface to bulk and a strongly bonded water peak at around 3250 cm$^{-1}$ in the layer closest to bulk. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules slow down from the interface to bulk, which correlates with the SFG results. From our EDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we observe a strong decline in total delocalization energy from bulk to the interface, as well as a decline in the strength of the strongest donor and acceptor interactions. The asymmetry between the two strongest interactions similarly rises towards the interface, while the importance of interactions from the outer solvation shells is greatly diminished and is lower than previously reported. Finally, we find that the strength of the strongest H-bond donor/acceptor is best correlated with the local minimum of the autocorrelation function resembling the L2 band librational motions. Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Diaz-Mejia, Sergio Lerma-Hernandez, Jorge G. Hirsch</p>
            <p>Quantum chaos in isolated quantum systems is intimately linked to thermalization and the rapid relaxation of observables. Although the spectral properties of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model have been well characterized, the corresponding dynamical signatures across the transition to regularity remain less explored . In this work, we investigate this transition by analyzing the time evolution of the survival probability, the single-site entanglement entropy, and the half-chain imbalance. Our results reveal a clear hierarchy in the sensitivity of these observables: the relaxation value of the entanglement entropy varies smoothly as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters across the chaos-regular transition, while the imbalance exhibits a more pronounced distinction. Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity. When appropriately scaled, all three observables converge onto a common behavior as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters for different numbers of sites and bosons,enabling a universal characterization of the transition between chaotic and regular dynamics.</p>

            <p>Continuous-time generative models for crystalline materials enable inverse materials design by learning to predict stable crystal structures, but incorporating explicit target properties into the generative process remains challenging. Policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled mechanism for aligning generative models with downstream objectives but typically requires access to the score, which has prevented its application to flow-based models that learn only velocity fields. We introduce Open Materials Generation with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning (OMatG-IRL), a policy-gradient RL framework that operates directly on the learned velocity fields and eliminates the need for the explicit computation of the score. OMatG-IRL leverages stochastic perturbations of the underlying generation dynamics preserving the baseline performance of the pretrained generative model while enabling exploration and policy-gradient estimation at inference time. Using OMatG-IRL, we present the first application of RL to crystal structure prediction (CSP). Our method enables effective reinforcement of an energy-based objective while preserving diversity through composition conditioning, and it achieves performance competitive with score-based RL approaches. Finally, we show that OMatG-IRL can learn time-dependent velocity-annealing schedules, enabling accurate CSP with order-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency and, correspondingly, reduction in generation time.</p>

            <p>Can superconducting order be made a robust attractor of open-system dynamics in strongly correlated lattices? We demonstrate that it can by proposing a minimal dissipation-engineering protocol for the particle--hole symmetric Hubbard model. By applying a rotated quantum jump operator, a locally transformed $\eta$-pair lowering operator, on as little as a single lattice site, we show that the Lindblad evolution autonomously pumps the system from the vacuum into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) with macroscopic $\eta$-pair off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization contrasts with schemes requiring spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a strictly local dissipative seed suffices to establish coherence across the interacting system. We elucidate the mechanism via local dark-state selection, controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we classify the stability of this NESS against static disorder, identifying a broad regime where the superconducting attractor is resilient to Hamiltonian perturbations that leave the effective subspace structure intact, while pinpointing specific perturbations that directly dephase the $\eta$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO. Our results establish a disorder-tolerant route to stabilizing superconducting order as a non-thermal attractor via minimal local quantum-jump control.</p>

            <p>Dirac exceptional points (EPs) represent a novel class of non-Hermitian singularities that, unlike conventional EPs, reside entirely within the parity-time unbroken phase and exhibit linear energy dispersion. Here, we theoretically investigate the quantum geometry of Dirac EPs realized in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, utilizing fidelity susceptibility as a probe. We demonstrate that despite the absence of a symmetry-breaking phase transition, the Dirac EP induces a pronounced geometric singularity, confirming the validity of fidelity in characterizing non-Hermitian EPs. Specifically, the real part of the fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity, which serves as a signature of non-Hermitian criticality. Crucially, however, we reveal that this divergence exhibits a distinct anisotropy, diverging along the non-reciprocal coupling direction while remaining finite along the detuning axis. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the omnidirectional divergence observed in conventional EPs. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the fidelity probe near the Dirac EP, highlighting the critical role of parameter directionality in exploiting Dirac EPs for quantum control and sensing applications.</p>

            <p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto standard for conditional sampling in diffusion models, yet it often leads to a loss of diversity in generated samples. We formalize this phenomenon as generative distortion, defined as the mismatch between the CFG-induced sampling distribution and the true conditional distribution. Considering Gaussian mixtures and their exact scores, and leveraging tools from statistical physics, we characterize the onset of distortion in a high-dimensional regime as a function of the number of classes. Our analysis reveals that distortions emerge through a phase transition in the effective potential governing the guided dynamics. In particular, our dynamical mean-field analysis shows that distortion persists when the number of modes grows exponentially with dimension, but vanishes in the sub-exponential regime. Consistent with prior finite-dimensional results, we further demonstrate that vanilla CFG shifts the mean and shrinks the variance of the conditional distribution. We show that standard CFG schedules are fundamentally incapable of preventing variance shrinkage. Finally, we propose a theoretically motivated guidance schedule featuring a negative-guidance window, which mitigates loss of diversity while preserving class separability.</p>

            <p>Energy Absorption Interferometry (EAI) is a technique for measuring the responsivities and complex-valued spatial polarimetric forms of the individual degrees of freedom through which a many-body system can absorb energy. It was originally formulated using the language of quantum correlation functions, making it applicable to different kinds of excitation (electromagnetic, elastic and acoustic fields). EAI has been applied in a variety of theoretical and experimental ways. It is particularly effective at characterising the multimode behaviour of ultra-low-noise far-infrared and optical devices, imaging arrays, and complete instruments, where it can be used to ensure that a system is maximally responsive to those partially coherent fields that carry signal whilst avoiding those that only carry noise. Despite its utility there is no comprehensive overview of electromagnetic EAI. In this paper we describe the theoretical foundations of the method, and present a range of new techniques in areas relating to sampling, phase referencing, mode reconstruction and noise. We present, for the first time, an analysis of how noise propagates through an experiment resulting in errors and artefacts on spectral and modal plots. A noise model is essential, because it determines the signal to noise ratio needed to ensure a given level of experimental fidelity.</p>

            <p>Disorder in photonic crystals and waveguides creates states inside the photonic band gap. These states are often described as Lifshitz tails despite exhibiting energy distributions inconsistent with Lifshitz statistics near the band edge. Here we show that in photonic-crystal waveguides with intentionally engineered anisotropic disorder, the band-edge tail accessible experimentally follows an Urbach law universally, with cumulative statistics $F(\Delta)=\exp[-(\Delta/\alpha)^\beta]$, where $\Delta$ is the spectral detuning from the band edge, and an exponent $\beta \approx 1$ independent of disorder strength and orientation. In contrast to Lifshitz behavior, the density of states is maximal at the band edge and decays into the gap. Crucially, we find that the Urbach energy $\alpha$ is anisotropic, with a pronounced directional splitting and qualitatively different scaling for disorder parallel and perpendicular to the waveguide axis. These conclusions are supported by quantitative agreement between optical measurements of GaAs photonic-crystal waveguides and full-vector simulations. The anisotropic Urbach energy emerges as a sensitive probe of disorder-mode coupling and a practical metric to characterize structural disorder in photonic devices.</p>

            <p>Optical resonances in nanostructures enable strong enhancement of nonlinear processes at the nanoscale, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), with high-$Q$ modes providing intensified light--matter interactions and sharp spectral selectivity for applications in filtering, sensing, and nonlinear spectroscopy. Thanks to the recent advances in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology, these key features can be now translated to lithium niobate for realizing novel nanoscale nonlinear optical platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large-area metasurface, realized by scalable nanoimprint lithography, comprising a slanted titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) nanograting on etchless TFLN for efficient narrowband SHG. This is enabled by the optimal coupling of quasi-bound state in the continuum (q-BIC) modes with a narrowband pulsed laser pump. The demonstrated normalized SHG efficiency is $0.15\%\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{GW}$, which is among the largest reported for LN metasurfaces. The low pump peak intensity ($3.64~\mathrm{kW}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) employed, which enables SHG even by continuous-wave pumping, allows envisioning integrated and portable photonic applications. SHG wavelength tuning from $870$ to $920~\mathrm{nm}$ with stable output power as well as polarization control is also achieved by off-normal pump illumination.

            <h2>The Intrinsic Connection between Dynamical Phase Transitions and Magnetization in the 1D XY Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin-Yue Luo, Wei-Lin Li, Bao-Ming Xu, Zhi Li</p>
            <p>In this manuscript, we study the quench dynamics of a transverse-field XY model starting from coherent Gibbs states. The results reveal that the initial strength of magnetization plays a crucial role in the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions. In concrete terms, when quenching within the same phase, through the properties of observables such as Fisher zeros and magnetization, we show that the stronger the initial magnetization, the more difficult the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions. The underlying mechanism is that the strong initial magnetization provides a directional effect, which inhibits the spin flipping in the process of quantum quench, making the dynamical quantum phase transition difficult to emerge. Since dynamical quantum phase transitions can be experimentally realized in various artificial systems, we hope that the physics predicted here can be experimentally verified in tabletop platforms.</p>

            <h2>Spectroscopic Signatures of a Liouvillian Exceptional Spectral Phase in a Collective Spin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael A. Molina</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian degeneracies of Lindblad generators (Liouvillian exceptional points) can induce non-exponential relaxation and higher-order poles in dynamical response functions. A collective spin coupled to a polarized Markovian bath exhibits an \emph{exceptional spectral phase} in which defective Liouvillian modes imprint super-Lorentzian features in frequency-resolved spectra. We compute the emission spectrum via the Liouvillian resolvent, identify symmetry-sector selection rules, and demonstrate that exceptional-point signatures are strongly state-dependent: they are suppressed in steady-state fluorescence yet become unambiguous for generic (infinite-temperature or random) initial states. Our results provide an experimentally accessible spectroscopic diagnostic of many-body Liouvillian exceptional phases and clarify when steady-state emission can (and cannot) reveal them.</p>

            <h2>General teleparallel geometric theory of defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muzaffer Adak, Ertan Kok, Mehmet Orhan</p>
            <p>We revisit the geometric theory of defects. In the differential-geometric models of defects that have been adopted since the 1950s, dislocations have been associated with torsion, disclinations with the full curvature, and point defects with the first kind trace of non-metricity. The mainstream formulation exhibits several conceptual and technical shortcomings, most notably a hierarchy inconsistency, the non-exictence of a genuine metric formulation, and the potential emergence of Ostrogradsky-type instabilities. These issues have motivated us to develop a new framework, namely a generalized teleparallel geometric theory of defects. In our model, dislocations are identified with the trace of torsion, disclinations with the second kind trace of the non-metricity, and point defects with the first kind trace of the non-metricity. In addition, we retain the scalar part torsion as a free parameter for describing some possible unknown degrees of freedom in the theory of defects. The proposed geometric theory of defects is free from all of the aforementioned drawbacks and is therefore worthy of further investigation. To ensure the coherence and completeness of the discussion, we begin our analysis with elastic deformations, then summarize the existing metric-affine geometric theory of defects, and finally proceed to our original contribution, namely the new theory introduced here. We formulate the entire theory in Eulerian coordinates. Naturally, all results can be reformulated in Lagrangian coordinates as well. All analyses and formulae are expressed in the language of exterior algebra and are carried out in coordinate-independent orthonormal frames.</p>

            <h2>Multipartite entanglement characterizing topological phase transitions in holographic nodal line semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiantong Chen, Xuanting Ji, Ya-Wen Sun</p>
            <p>Topological states of matter are characterized by nonlocal structures that are naturally encoded in the quantum entanglement of many-body wavefunctions. Topological semimetals are short-range entangled states at weak coupling and their entanglement structure at strong coupling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure of strongly coupled holographic nodal line semimetals. Building on previous studies of entanglement entropy and the holographic c-function, we focus on multipartite entanglement measures, including the conditional mutual information, multi-entropy, and the Markov gap which is based on the entanglement wedge cross section. Our results demonstrate that while these multipartite measures vanish in the long-distance limit $l \to \infty$, which confirms that the holographic nodal line semimetal remains a short-range entangled state, their large $l$ scaling behavior remains highly sensitive to the underlying topology. The large $l$ power-law decay and scaling exponents serve as robust, non-local order parameters that exhibit sharp changes at the quantum critical point. This work establishes multi-partite entanglement as a powerful probe of quantum topological phase transitions in strongly coupled topological systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salma Zahran, Zhou Ao, Zhengyang Zhang, Chen Chi, Chenchen Yuan, Yanming Wang</p>
            <p>Semantic segmentation of microscopy images is a critical task for high-throughput materials characterisation, yet its automation is severely constrained by the prohibitive cost, subjectivity, and scarcity of expert-annotated data. While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis.</p>

            <p>Phase transitions among Mg2SiO4 and its high-pressure polymorphs (wadsleyite and ringwoodite) are central to mantle dynamics and deep-mantle material cycling. However, the locations and Pressure-Temperature (P-T) dependences of these phase boundaries remain debated, largely due to experimental limitations at extreme conditions and the high computational cost of first-principles free-energy calculations. Here, a machine-learning-potential driven workflow combining non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration (NETI) and two-phase coexistence simulations is employed to enable large-scale, long-timescale molecular dynamics sampling. Within this workflow, the melting curve of forsterite is evaluated and a complete P-T phase diagram is constructed. Relative to conventional ab initio approaches, this strategy reduces computational expense while retaining thermodynamic consistency in phase-stability assessment. The workflow is applicable to efficient evaluation of phase stability and thermodynamic properties in deep-Earth silicate systems.</p>

            <h2>Semidefinite programming for understanding limitations of Lindblad equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumyadeep Sarma, Manas Kulkarni, Archak Purkayastha, Devashish Tupkary</p>
            <p>Lindbladian quantum master equations (LEs) are the most popular descriptions for quantum systems weakly coupled to baths. But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings.</p>

            <h2>Finite-Size Scaling of the Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Quantum Spin Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuke Zhang, Pengfei Zhang</p>
            <p>Despite the unitary evolution of closed quantum systems, long-time expectation of local observables are well described by thermal ensembles, providing the foundation of quantum statistical mechanics. A promising route to understanding this quantum thermalization is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that individual energy eigenstates already appear locally thermal. Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems. Our results provide a systematic and practical methodology for validating the full ETH in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Universal scaling of finite-temperature quantum adiabaticity in driven many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Ying Chou, Jyong-Hao Chen</p>
            <p>Establishing quantitative adiabaticity criteria at finite temperature remains substantially less developed than in the pure-state setting, despite the fact that realistic quantum systems are never at absolute zero. Here we derive rigorous bounds on the Hilbert-Schmidt fidelity between mixed states by combining a mixed-state quantum speed limit with mixed-state fidelity susceptibility within the Liouville space formulation of quantum mechanics. Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate. Our results provide practical and largely model-independent criteria for finite-temperature adiabaticity in closed many-body systems.</p>

            <p>We study shear fluctuations in non-relativistic holographic systems coupled to torsional Newton-Cartan geometry, using asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity. We identify a universal subdiffusive shear mode characterized by the quartic dispersion relation $\omega=-iD_4 k^4$, in sharp contrast to the conventional hydrodynamic diffusion. We derive this result analytically through a systematic higher-order matched asymptotic expansion connecting near-horizon and far-region solutions, and we verify it with direct numerical quasinormal mode calculations. Our numerics demonstrate that the first non-hydrodynamic mode is purely imaginary and gapped, following the dispersion relation $\omega=-i\omega_0-i D k^2$, and that both the hydrodynamic and the first non-hydrodynamic modes pass through pole-skipping points. These results highlight Lifshitz holography as an efficient framework for anomalous transport in strongly coupled non-relativistic quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>The soliton nature of the super-Klein tunneling effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Correa, Luis Inzunza, Olaf Lechtenfeld</p>
            <p>We establish a relationship between the Davey--Stewartson II (DS II) integrable system in $(2{+}1)$ dimensions and quasi-exactly solvable planar interacting Dirac Hamiltonians that exhibit the super-Klein tunneling (SKT) effect. The Dirac interactions are constructed from the real and imaginary parts of breather solutions of the DS II system. In this framework, the SKT effect arises when the energy is tuned to match the constant background of the soliton, while the resulting Dirac Hamiltonians simultaneously support bound states embedded in the continuum. By imposing the SKT boundary conditions, we employ Darboux transformations to construct a general three-parameter family of DS II breather solutions that can be mapped to Dirac Hamiltonians. At the initial soliton time, the corresponding Dirac systems form a massless two-parameter family of Hermitian models with nontrivial electrostatic potentials. As the soliton time evolves, the systems become $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and develop a nontrivial imaginary mass term. Finally, when the soliton time is taken to be imaginary, the construction yields Hermitian Dirac systems that lack time-reversal symmetry. In all cases, we identify the emergence of quasi-symmetry transformations that preserve the SKT subspace of states while not commuting with the full Hamiltonian.</p>

            <h2>A Schwinger-Keldysh Formulation of Semiclassical Operator Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeff Murugan, Hendrik J. R. van Zyl</p>
            <p>In this work we develop a real-time Schwinger-Keldysh formulation of Krylov dynamics that treats Krylov complexity as an in-in observable generated by a closed time contour path integral. The resulting generating functional exposes an emergent phase-space description in which the Lanczos coefficients define an effective Hamiltonian governing operator motion along the Krylov chain. In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations classified as irrelevant, marginal or relevant. Going beyond the saddle, the Schwinger-Keldysh framework provides controlled access to fluctuations and large deviations of Krylov complexity, revealing sharp signatures of integrability-chaos crossovers that are invisible at the level of the mean. This formulation reorganises Krylov complexity into a dynamical field-theoretic framework and identifies new fluctuation diagnostics of operator growth in closed quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Active control over strong optical nonlinearity in solid-state systems is central to unlocking exotic many-body phenomena and scalable photonic devices. While exciton-polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer a promising platform, their practical utility is often impeded by fixed interaction parameters and an intrinsic trade-off between nonlinearity and oscillator strength. Here, we report electrically tunable dipolar polaritons in a dual-gated bilayer MoS2 microcavity, demonstrating in situ reshaping of the dispersion and modulation of the light-matter coupling strength via the quantum-confined Stark effect. Crucially, this architecture enables a giant polariton-polariton interaction strength tunable by a factor of seven. This nonlinearity enhancement arises from a synergistic interplay, in which the electric field amplifies the microscopic dipolar repulsion while simultaneously optimizing the macroscopic excitonic Hopfield coefficient. Furthermore, electrostatic doping serves as an independent control knob to switch the system between strong and weak coupling regimes. Our findings bridge the gap between strong optical coupling and giant dipolar nonlinearities, establishing the TMD homobilayer as a versatile platform for engineering programmable correlated many-body states on a chip.</p>

To interpret the observed features, we introduce a double-pulse interference model and employ an adaptive learning-based reconstruction algorithm using the Adam optimizer to retrieve the temporal field evolution. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental measurements.

            <p>We develop a diffuse-interface continuum model for membrane electroporation that couples a phase field for pore geometry to a quasi-static electrolyte potential and a spatially varying leaky-dielectric model for the transmembrane voltage. The main contribution is a stabilized time-integration strategy for transmembrane voltage $V_m$: the stiff leakage term is treated implicitly while the electrolyte-to-membrane ionic current is lagged, yielding a closed-form update that removes the restriction imposed by the fast dielectric relaxation time. The electrolyte potential is computed efficiently using a semi-analytical spectral Laplace solver: a 2D DCT in the membrane plane reduces the 3D problem to independent 1D ODEs in $z$, solved in closed form and reconstructed by an inverse transform. The coupled method is robust under grid refinement, reproduces the sharp-interface critical-radius bifurcation, and captures electric-field focusing through conductive pores. We also demonstrate stochastic pore nucleation by adding thermal noise to the phase-field dynamics, enabling fully emergent electroporation events without prescribing initial defects.</p>

            <p>We execute a numerical simulation on active nematics with particles interacting by an excluded volume effect. The systems with rhomboidal particles and that with elliptical particles are considered in order to investigate the effect of the direct contact of particles. In our simulation, the void regions, where the local number density is almost zero, appear in both systems when the aspect ratio of the particles is high. We focused on the relationship between the void regions and the particle orientation of the bulk. The particle number density, particle orientation, topological defects, and void regions are analyzed for different aspect ratios in both systems. The systems with rhomboidal particles have characteristic void sizes, which increase with an increase in the aspect ratio. In contrast, the distribution of the void-region size in the systems with elliptical particles is broad. The present results suggest that the void size in the systems with rhomboidal particles is determined by the correlation length of the particle orientational field around the void regions, while that might be determined by the system size in the systems with elliptical particles.</p>

To understand how multifractality may emerge in critical-like systems modeling neuronal activity, we used a neural field model exhibiting neural oscillations and a critical phase transition. We find that multifractality emerges near a synchronization phase transition, and that the pattern of variation of multifractality changes when placing the model at a different phase transition. These findings show that multifractality in temporal dynamics emerges near criticality in neural fields, providing a formal basis for interpreting multifractality in brain recordings.</p>

            <p>Living systems operate out of equilibrium, continuously consuming energy to sustain organised, functional states. Their emergent behaviour usually relies on a set of interconnected chemical reaction networks (CRNs) driven by external fluxes that keep some species at fixed concentrations. Hence, uncovering the principles governing the functioning of these CRNs is crucial to understand how living systems generate and regulate complexity. While kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of a CRN is fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics. Here, we introduce and analytically derive the "thermodynamic space" of a CRN, i.e., the range of accessible stationary concentrations that can be realized under a given energetic budget. We establish analogous bounds for reaction affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties, such as the total non-equilibrium driving, can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in various paradigmatic examples, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium conditions. By providing a general tool for analysing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena and design artificial chemical systems, starting from the sole knowledge of the underlying thermodynamic properties.</p>

            <p>Manipulating and controlling the band structure and the spin-splitting in the newly discovered class of magnetic materials known as 'altermagnets' is highly desirable for their application in spintronics. Based on real-time simulations for an interacting multiband tight-binding model, we propose optical excitations as an effective way to selectively control the spin-splitting of an altermagnet. The consistent treatment of electronic interactions and electron-phonon coupling in the model allows for a systematic study of the effect of these interactions on the spin-splitting of the altermagnet in the ground as well as in the excited-state. Our simulations reveal that optical excitations modify the band structure and thus lead to significant changes in the spin-splitting within 50 fs. The relative spin-splitting in the conduction band grows up to four times in the optically excited altermagnet. We disentangle the roles of Coulomb $U$ and $J$ in the enhancement of the spin-splitting in the photoexcited state. Our study elucidates the potential for exploiting optical control of spin-splitting gaps to obtain desirable properties in altermagnets on the fastest possible timescales.</p>

            <p>Several types of active agents self-propel by spinning around their propulsion axis, thus behaving as active screws. Examples include cytoskeletal filaments in gliding assays, magnetically-driven colloidal helices, and microorganisms like the soil bacterium $\it{M. xanthus}$. Here, we develop a model for spinning self-propelled rods on a substrate, and we coarse-grain it to derive the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. If the rods propel purely along their axis, they form an active nematic at high density and activity. However, spinning rods can also roll sideways as they move. We find that this transverse motion turns the system into a chiral active nematic. Thus, we identify a mechanism whereby individual chirality can give rise to collective chiral flows. Finally, we analyze experiments on $\it{M. xanthus}$ colonies to show that they exhibit chiral flows around topological defects, with a chiral activity about an order of magnitude weaker than the achiral one. Our work reveals the collective behavior of active screws, which is relevant to colonies of social bacteria and groups of unicellular parasites.</p>

The method uses a statistical approach based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The measure is calculated by comparing the transformed atomic density function with its original. Software code is presented that carries the calculations out numerically using Monte Carlo methods. The behavior of this symmetry breaking measure is tested for various cases including finite size crystallites (where the surfaces break the crystallographic symmetry), atomic displacements from high symmetry positions, and collective motions of atoms due to rotations of rigid octahedra. The approach provides a powerful tool for assessing local symmetry breaking and offers new insights that can help researchers understand how different structural distortions affect different symmetry operations.</p>

For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors $z$, which dictates the extent of spatial and quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy $K$. The universality of $z$ (its ability to describe specific heat across diverse lattices) holds robustly for systems where exchange interactions do not strongly increase with distance and in the absence of frustration. Otherwise, deviations from universality emerge. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. The present approach enables the extraction of magnetic interaction parameters not accessible through mean-field theory, offering a powerful tool for interpreting specific heat data in 4f$^7$ systems.</p>

Then we microscopically construct symmetry-preserving gapped boundary states of the closely-related (4+1)d $C_N\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state (with $C_N$ being the $N$-fold rotation), whenever it is possible. In particular, for $\nu=N$, we show that the (3+1)d symmetric gapped state admits a topological $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory description at low energy, and propose that a similar theory saturates the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^\mathrm{F}$ anomaly. For $N \nmid \nu$, our construction admits no topological quantum field theory (TQFT) symmetric gapped state; while for $\nu=N/2$, we find a non-TQFT symmetric gapped state via stacking lower-dimensional (2+1)d non-discrete-gauge-theory topological order inhomogeneously. For other values of $\nu$, no symmetric gapped state is possible within our construction, which is consistent with the no-go theorem by Cordova-Ohmori.</p>

            <h2>How glass breaks -- Damage explains the difference between surface and fracture energies in amorphous silica</h2>

            <p>The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a 16-23 A range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.</p>

            <h2>Design of magnonic waveguides using surface anisotropy-induced Bragg mirrors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grzegorz Centała, Jarosław W. Kłos</p>
            <p>Waveguides are fundamental components for signal transmission in integrated wave-based processing systems. In this paper, we address the challenges in designing magnonic waveguides, including limitations such as non-uniform demagnetizing fields, reduced group velocity, and restricted operating frequency ranges. We propose a magnonic waveguide design with promising properties that overcome these limitations to a significant extent. Specifically, we investigate a waveguide formed within a uniform ferromagnetic layer (Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$) by applying surface anisotropy in strip regions, thereby creating Bragg mirror structures to confine spin waves and guide them along a single direction. The proposed waveguide enables the propagation of high-frequency spin waves with high velocities in the ferromagnetic layer while minimizing static demagnetizing effects. We developed a model that allows for spin-wave confinement and guidance in two perpendicular directions by spatially modulating the surface anisotropy. The theoretical model was solved using the finite element method to calculate the dispersion relations of the waveguide modes and analyze their spatial profiles. Additionally, we determine the group velocity and localization characteristics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the waveguide's performance.</p>

            <h2>Topological advantage for adsorbate chemisorption on conjugated chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael F. Ribeiro, Luis Martinez-Gomez</p>
            <p>Topological matter offers opportunities for control of charge and energy flow with implications for chemistry still incompletely understood. In this work, we study an ensemble of adsorbates with an empty frontier level (LUMO) coupled to the edges, domain walls (solitons), and bulk of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger polyacetylene chain across its trivial insulator, metallic, and topological insulator phases. We find that two experimentally relevant observables, charge donation into the LUMO and the magnitude of adsorbate electronic friction, are significantly impacted by the electronic phase of the SSH chain and show clear signatures of the topological phase transition. Localized, symmetry-protected midgap states at edges and solitons strongly enhance electron donation relative to both the metallic and trivial phases, whereas by contrast, the metal's extended states, despite larger total DOS near the Fermi energy, hybridize more weakly with a molecular adsorbate near a particular site. Electronic friction is largest in the metal, strongly suppressed in gapped regions, and intermediate at topological edges where hybridization splits the midgap resonance. These trends persist with disorder highlighting their robustness and suggest engineering domain walls and topological boundaries as pathways for employing topological matter in molecular catalysis and sensing.</p>

            <p>We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</p>

            <p>Recent experimental advances have uncovered fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) systems under zero magnetic field. Understanding the interaction effects on topological phases within realistic model presents a significant theoretical challenge. Here, we construct a moiré superlattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich variety of interaction-driven and filling-dependent topological phases, including FCIs, Chern insulators, and generalized Wigner crystals, which are revealed in recent experiments. For FCI state, dynamical simulations uncover a single-particle excitation continuum with a finite charge gap, reflecting the fractionalized charge excitations. Finite-temperature calculations further determine characteristic charge activation and ferromagnetic transition temperatures, reconciling existing experimental discrepancies. Furthermore, using this realistic lattice model, we predict the presence of quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional fillings in tMoTe$_2$. By integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical analyses, our work establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related moiré systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youwen Liang, Wan Shou</p>
            <p>Laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) printing is a versatile technique to realize micro/nano-scale additive manufacturing of functional materials, including metals and semiconductors. However, the crystallization phenomena during LIFT printing have not been well understood, which is critical to determine the resulting microstructure and properties. In this work, we systematically investigate silicon crystallization during LIFT printing using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Specifically, MD simulation with Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential is used to investigate the size effect and surface influence on the crystallization of Si nanoparticles during transportation in air. We found that with a decrease in nanoparticle size, crystallization becomes increasingly rare, even at low cooling rates. The nucleation location of different particles is also analyzed and almost always starts at a sub-surface location (below 5 Å). The evolution of the atomic structure during solidification is also monitored to guide LIFT printing of Si. Our simulation results indicate that nano-confinement induced by the surface layer can lead to single-crystal structure formation, which may shed light on additive manufacturing of single-crystal structures and devices.</p>

Tight-binding simulations confirm the presence of multiple hinge modes, supporting our interpretation of Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$ as a prototypical designable SOTI platform.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Chen Ye, Karma Tenzin, Jagoda Sławińska, Carmine Autieri</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the Néel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Wei, Yanmei Cai, Boyang Wen, Tianxing Ma</p>
            <p>Higher-order Van Hove singularities in strongly correlated electron systems provide a fertile ground for emergent electronic orders and superconductivity. This study investigates the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities on the honeycomb lattice, a paradigmatic platform relevant to graphene. By incorporating third-nearest-neighbor hopping \(t''\), we uncover a universal crossover: ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate below the higher-order Van Hove filling, while antiferromagnetic fluctuations take over toward half filling. A key finding is that the already dominant \(f_n\)-wave pairing is enhanced in the critical region of this magnetic crossover by the higher-order Van Hove. This enhancement is driven by the synergistic effect of the higher-order Van Hove singularities-induced divergent density of states and the competing magnetic fluctuations. Although increased hopping parameters generally suppress superconducting correlation, we identify a critical \(t''\) that anomalously enhances pairing via the higher-order Van Hove renormalization. Furthermore, the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction suppresses the pairing correlation function in a sign-independent manner. Our results clarify the competitive mechanisms between magnetic fluctuations and unconventional superconductivity in higher-order Van Hove singularities systems, offering a theoretical basis for tailoring quantum phases in graphene-based materials via band engineering.</p>

            <p>Understanding the dynamics of short-range correlations is a central challenge in strongly interacting Fermi gases. In ultracold gases, these correlations are quantified by the contact parameter, yet measurements to date have been limited to equilibrium systems or relatively slow, global dynamics. Here, we introduce a rapid spectroscopic technique based on projection of the interacting state onto an alternate scattering channel with a low-lying dimer state. We demonstrate contact measurements on the microsecond timescale -- faster than the inverse Fermi energy. Using $^{40}$K near a broad $s$-wave Feshbach resonance, we show that the strength of the dimer-projection feature scales proportionally with the contact parameter extracted from the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Analysis of the spectra further reveals that the dimer feature provides the dominant contribution to the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, allowing the first experimental bound on this quantity. The observed deviations from universal predictions highlight the importance of multichannel effects. Our results open new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.</p>

            <p>We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Balog, Lucija Nora Farkaš, Maroje Marohnić, Gilles Tarjus</p>
            <p>We explore the application of the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (NPFRG) within its most common approximation scheme based on truncations of the derivative expansion, to the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar $\varphi^4$ theory as the lower critical dimension $d_{\rm lc}$ is approached. We aim to assess whether the NPFRG - a broad, nonspecialized method which is accurate in $d\geq 2$ - can capture the effect of the localized (droplet) excitations that drive the disappearance of the phase transition in $d_{\rm lc}$ and control the critical behavior as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$. We extend a prior analysis to the next (second) order of the derivative expansion to check the convergence of the results and the robustness of the conclusions. The study turns out to be much more involved. Through extensive numerical and analytical work we provide evidence that the convergence to $d_{\rm lc}$ is nonuniform in the field dependence and is characterized by the emergence of a boundary layer near the minima of the fixed-point effective potential. This is the mathematical mechanism through which the NPFRG within the truncated derivative expansion reproduces nontrivial features predicted by the droplet theory of Bruce and Wallace [1,2], namely, the existence of two distinct small parameters as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$ that control different aspects of the critical behavior and that are nonperturbatively related. The second order of the derivative expansion fixes several issues that were encountered at the lower level and improves the compatibility with the droplet-theory predictions. [1] A. D. Bruce and D.

            <h2>Spatial QUBO: Convolutional Formulation of Large-Scale Binary Optimization with Dense Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Yamashita, Hideyuki Suzuki</p>
            <p>The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p>

            <p>Topological flat bands play an essential role in inducing exotic interacting physics, ranging from fractional Chern insulators to superconductivity, in moiré materials. In this work, we propose a design principle for realizing topological flat bands with "ideal quantum geometry", namely the trace of Fubini-Study metric equals to the Berry curvature, in a class of two-dimensional moiré heterostructures with type-II band alignment. We first introduce a moiré Chern-band model to describe this system and show that topological flat bands can be realized in this model when the moiré superlattice potential is stronger than the type-II atomic band gap of the heterostructure. Next, we map this model into a topological heavy fermion model that consists of a localized orbital for "f-electron" and a conducting band for "c-electron". We find that both the flatness and quantum geometry of the flat band in the topological heavy fermion model depend on the energy gap between c-electron and f-electron bands at $\Gamma$ which is experimentally controllable via external gate voltages. This tunability will allow us to realize an ideal topological flat band with zero band-width and ideal quantum geometry. Our design strategy of topological flat bands is insensitive of twist angle. We also discuss possible material candidates for moiré heterostructures with type-II band alignment.</p>

Our results suggest that rhombohedral graphene multilayers, which are believed to host the required ingredients, might offer an ideal setting for the study of exotic superconducting collective modes.</p>

            <p>The search for conditions supporting degenerate steady states in nonequilibrium topological superconductors is important for advancing dissipative quantum engineering, a field that has attracted significant research attention over the past decade. In this study, we address this problem by investigating topological superconductors hosting unpaired Majorana modes under the influence of environmental dissipative fields. Within the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad framework and the third quantization formalism, we establish a correspondence between equilibrium Majorana zero modes and non-equilibrium kinetic zero modes. We further derive a simple algebraic relation between the numbers of these excitations expressed in terms of hybridization between the single-particle wavefunctions and linear dissipative fields. Based on these findings, we propose a practical recipes how to stabilize degenerate steady states in topological superconductors through controlled dissipation engineering. To demonstrate their applicability, we implement our general framework in the BDI-class Kitaev chain with long-range hopping and pairing terms -- a system known to host a robust edge-localized Majorana modes.</p>

            <p>Soft-solid molecular crystals consist of crystalline grains and fluid grain boundaries (GB) that enhance grain binding and transport of Li+ ions between the grains. The total ionic conductivity consists of ion migration in both the grains and GBs. To unravel these contributions in adiponitrile (Adpn)-LiPF6 molecular crystals, the GB volume fraction was varied by changing the size of the crystals and the Adpn-LiPF6 molar ratio. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the grains and well-diffusive in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (1M) than in saturated Adpn-LiPF6 solutions (0.04M), and Li+ ions predominantly solvated by cyano groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the faster-conducting GBs.</p>

The {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 interface hosts a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with large spin-orbit coupling, making it promising for spintronics applications if it can be coupled to a suitable source of spin currents. Here, we synthesize a ferrimagnetic insulating NiFe2O4(001) layer on {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) using a low-temperature reactive sputtering at 150 deg C without compromising the mobility and charge carrier density of the 2DEG at the {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) interface. The sheet resistance of both {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 and NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 exhibits metallic behavior down to cryogenic temperatures, with a low temperature upturn driven by the Kondo-like scattering. Most importantly, NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 behaves as a magnetic diode at low temperatures, and its rectification performance increases significantly with increasing magnetic field strength giving rise to a robust magneto-electronic rectification effect at low temperatures, which provides a first step towards the development of all-oxide heterostructures capable of efficient spin-charge conversion.</p>

Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</p>

However, their realization in solids has traditionally relied on top-down methods, which are limited by structural disorder and coarse confinement.

Using lateral $MoSe_2-WSe_2$ heterostructures, we identify interfacial excitonic quasiparticles that are bound to the crystal junction. Photoluminescence spectroscopy resolves these excitons into a ladder of discrete states, establishing nanoscopic 1D confinement at length scales of 3 nm. These excitons possess exceptional large permanent in-plane electric dipole moments exceeding e x 2 nm, and exhibit micron-scale, highly anisotropic diffusion confined to the interface. Crucially, the lateral geometry enables dynamic, in-situ reconfiguration of the exciton's internal structure. By introducing electrostatic doping, we demonstrate a collapse of the dipole moment and a 20-fold reduction in radiative lifetime. This structural tunability establishes lateral interfaces as a uniquely powerful platform for the 'bottom-up' engineering of 1D quantum matter. By enabling the dynamic tuning of wavefunctions within a single atomic monolayer, this work opens a scalable route toward 1D excitonic circuits and strongly correlated 1D bosonic phases.</p>

            <h2>Windmilling clusters of active quadrupoles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Margaret Rosenberg, Hartmut Löwen</p>
            <p>Active matter has thrived in recent years, driven both by the insight that it underlies fundamental processes in nature, and by its vast potential for applications. This allows for innovation both inspired by experimental observations, and by construction of novel systems with desired properties. In this paper, we develop a novel system in the search for a new kind of pattern formation: microstructural motifs with orthogonal alignment. Taking a simple active Brownian particle (ABP) model applied to dumbbell-shaped particles, we add a quadrupolar interaction by positioning two antiparallel magnetic dipolar moments on each particle. We find that the phase behavior is determined by the competition between active motion and the orthogonal alignment favored by quadrupolar attraction. By varying these quantities, we are able to tune both the internal structure of the aggregates, and find a surprising stability of triangular aggregates, to the point of clusters of size $N=3$ being strongly overrepresented. Although none of the component particles are chiral, the resulting structures spin in a random, fixed direction due to combination of the polarity of the active motion. This results in an ensemble of windmilling (randomly spinning in a circular motion) aggregates with windmill-like shape (due to the three- or four core component dumbbells). Ultimately, this simple model shows an interesting range of microstructural motifs, with great potential for experimental implementations.</p>

            <h2>Transition between 2D Symmetry Protected Topological Phases on a Klein Bottle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vibhu Ravindran, Bowen Yang, Xie Chen</p>
            <p>Manifolds with nontrivial topology play an essential role in the study of topological phases of matter. In this paper, we study the nontrivial symmetry response of the $2+1$D $Z_2$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase when the system is put on a non-orientable manifold -- the Klein bottle. In particular, we find that when a symmetry defect is inserted along the orientation-reversing cycle of the Klein bottle, the ground state of the system gets an extra charge. This response remains well defined at transition points into the trivial SPT phase, resulting in an exact two-fold degeneracy in the ground state independent of the system size. We demonstrate the symmetry response using exactly solvable lattice models of the SPT phase, as well as numerical work across the transition. We explore the connection of this result to the modular transformation of the $3+1$D $Z_2$ gauge theory and the emergent nature of the parity symmetry in the $Z_2$ SPT phase.</p>

            <h2>Multiscale analysis of large twist ferroelectricity and swirling dislocations in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Tusher Ahmed, Chenhaoyue Wang, Amartya S. Banerjee, Nikhil Chandra Admal</p>
            <p>With its atomically thin structure and intrinsic ferroelectric properties, heterodeformed bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained prominence in next-generation non-volatile memory applications. However, studies to date have focused almost exclusively on small$-$twist bilayer hBN, leaving the question of whether ferroelectricity can persist under small heterostrain and large heterodeformation entirely unexplored. In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the $21.786789^\circ$ twisted configuration ($\Sigma 7$), using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma7$ stackings. Atomistic simulations reveal that AA-vicinal systems support ferroelectricity under both small twist and small strain, with polarization switching in the latter governed by the deformation of swirling dislocations rather than the straight interface dislocations seen in the former. For $\Sigma7$-vicinal systems, where existing interatomic potentials underperform particularly under extreme out-of-plane compression, we develop a density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework-the bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer hBN. The BFIM model reproduces experimental results and provides a powerful, computationally efficient framework for predicting ferroelectricity in large-unit-cell heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory (DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in carbon nanodevices.</p>

            <p>While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database (constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the limitations of diffusion models.</p>

            <p>The increasing importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials research has created demand for automated, high-throughput characterization techniques capable of rapidly generating large data sets. We describe here a new instrument for simultaneous X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, optimized for high-throughput studies of combinatorial specimens. A bright, focused, high-energy X-ray beam (24 keV) combined with a pixel array area detector allows spatially-resolved (~200 {\mu}m) transmission diffraction measurements through thick (100 {\mu}m) specimens of structural metals with exposure times as short as 1 s. Simultaneously, a silicon drift detector records X-ray fluorescence from the specimen for spatially-resolved measurement of composition. Specimen handling is fully automated, with a robot inside the X-ray enclosure manipulating the sample for measurements at different locations. Data orchestration is also automated, with data streamed off the instrument and processed autonomously. In this paper we assess the performance of the instrument in terms of throughput, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio, and provide an example of its capabilities through a combinatorial study of Cu-Ti alloys to demonstrate rapid data set creation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mário J. de Oliveira</p>
            <p>We investigate the properties of a Kolmogorov equation governing the time evolution of the probability distribution defined in phase space. Energy is strictly conserved along a trajectory in phase space, meaning the equation is appropriate to describe an isolated system, and the stationary state is the Gibbs microcanonical distribution. The equation predicts the increase in entropy in agreement with thermodynamics, and in contrast with the Liouville equation, which conserves entropy. Using an approximation in which the distribution is a product of one-particle distributions, we derive the Boltzmann equation of kinetic theory. We also consider a Kolmogorov equation to describe an open system in contact with the external environment. In this case the equation describes not only the situation in which the system is found in thermodynamic equilibrium with a Gibbs canonical distribution in the stationary state, but also the nonequilibrium steady state with a continuous production of entropy.</p>

            <p>Accurate structural relaxation is critical for advanced materials design. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which strive to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method consistently improves performance across all evaluated pretrained models; resulting in an average of roughly 32% reduction in prediction error. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications.</p>

            <p>Multilayer graphene with different stacking sequences has emerged as a powerful setting for correlated and topological phases. In parallel, progress in graphene heterostructures with magnetic or correlated materials-most notably the Kitaev candidate $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$-has demonstrated charge transfer, magnetic proximity effects, and interfacial reconstruction, creating new opportunities for engineered quantum systems. Motivated by these developments, we explore a three-dimensional analogue in which $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ layers are inserted directly into the van der Waals gaps of graphite, forming an intercalated system. Here, we report the successful synthesis and comprehensive characterization of graphite intercalated with $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, quantum oscillation measurements, and first-principles electronic structure calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of these intercalated crystals. Our results demonstrate that graphite intercalated with $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ offers a robust route to develop three-dimensional materials with access to novel correlated and topological states.</p>

            <p>Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.</p>

            <p>We present a first-principles study of the multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in the exctied $^{3}E$ state of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using density functional theory combined with an intrinsic distortion path (IDP) analysis, we resolve the full activation pathways of the JT distortion and quantitatively decompose the distortion into contributions from individual vibrational modes. We find that multiple vibrational modes participate cooperatively in the JT dynamics, giving rise to a shallow adiabatic potential energy surface with low barriers, consistent with thermally activated pseudorotation. The dominant JT-active modes are found to closely correspond to vibrational features observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), in agreement with recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results establish a microscopic, mode-resolved picture of vibronic coupling in the excited-state NV center and provide new insight into dephasing, relaxation, and optically driven dynamics relevant to solid-state quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Entropic trade-off relations in stochastic thermodynamics via replica Markov processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Traditional thermodynamic trade-off relations usually apply to quantities that depend linearly on probability distributions. In contrast, many important information-theoretic measures, such as entropies, are nonlinear and thus difficult to analyze with existing frameworks. Motivated by replica ideas in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we introduce \emph{replica Markov processes}, i.e., Markovian dynamics of $K$ independent, identical copies, and derive trade-off relations that bound relative moments of replica observables in terms of dynamical activity. By choosing appropriate replica observables, these inequalities translate into bounds on nonlinear quantities of the original single process. Focusing on entropic measures of uncertainty, we obtain upper bounds on the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy for general trajectory-observable distributions, and corresponding bounds for diffusion on networks. We also illustrate how replicas can handle other nonlinear functionals such as extreme-value observables. Finally, we extend the construction to continuously monitored open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics, where the bounds are expressed in terms of the quantum dynamical activity. These results provide entropic counterparts to activity-based uncertainty relations and establish a general method for constraining nonlinear information-theoretic quantities in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Beyond on-site Hubbard interaction in charge dynamics of cuprate superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroyuki Yamase</p>
            <p>In this review, we first present compelling evidence from resonant inelastic x-ray scattering data that highlights the significance of the long-range Coulomb interaction in cuprate charge dynamics, particularly around the in-plane momentum q=(0,0). We show that these experimental observations are well-captured by the layered t-J-V model, which extends the standard t-J framework to include the long-range Coulomb interaction V and the layered structure. This new perspective elucidates how charge dynamics renormalizes one-particle excitation properties, leading to several profound and often counterintuitive consequences. We demonstrate that the electron dispersion does not exhibit a sharp kink, and Landau quasiparticles persist in the low-energy limit despite a significant suppression of their spectral weight. We further show that while charge fluctuations alone cannot fully account for the pseudogap, they are a crucial component for understanding its formation. Additionally, we reveal that optical plasmon excitations generate fermionic quasiparticles, known as plasmarons, which give rise to a distinct, incoherent replica band. We argue that accurately describing these plasmonic effects requires a three-dimensional theoretical approach. This perspective on plasmon excitations may offer a critically new clue to a long-standing puzzle: why multi-layer cuprate superconductors, containing more than two CuO2 layers per unit cell, consistently exhibit a higher critical temperature Tc than their single-layer counterparts. Finally, we review the spin-fluctuation mechanism of superconductivity suffers from the "self-restraint effect" and show how important the screened Coulomb interaction is in the spin-fluctuation mechanism to realize high-Tc superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We report an emergent ac Josephson-like effect arising without external bias, driven by the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates. Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms.</p>

            <p>Magnons are bosonic quasiparticles in magnetically ordered systems. Bosonic Bott index has been affirmed as a real-space topological invariant for a two-band ferromagnetic model. In this work,we theoretically investigate the topology and transport of magnons in a multi-band bosonic Kagome ferromagnetic model. We demonstrate the validity of the bosonic Bott indices of values larger than 1 in multi-band magnonic systems by showing the agreement with Chern numbers in the clean limit and the bulk-boundary correspondence during the topological phase transition. For the high Bott index phase, the disorder-induced topological phase transition occurs in a multi-step manner. Using a generalized Landauer-Buttiker formalism, we reveal how the magnon transport depends on Gilbert damping and disorder under coherent excitation or temperature difference. The results further justify the bosonic Bott index as a robust real-space topological invariant for multi-band magnonic systems and provide insights into the transport of topological magnons.</p>

            <p>Materials with interesting physical properties are often designed based on our understanding of the target physical effects. The physical properties can be either explicitly observed ("apparent") or concealed by the perceived symmetry ("hidden") but still exist. Both are enabled by specific symmetries and induced by certain physical interactions. Using the underlying approach of condensed matter theory of real materials (rather than schematic model Hamiltonians), we discuss apparent and hidden physics in real materials focusing on the properties of spin splitting and spin polarization. Depending on the enabling symmetries and underlying physical interactions, we classify spin effects into four categories with each having two subtypes; representative materials are pointed out. We then discuss the electric tunability and switch of apparent and hidden spin splitting and polarization in antiferromagnets. Finally, we extend "hidden effects" to views that are farsighted in the sense of resolving the correct atomistic and reciprocal symmetry and replaced by the incorrect higher symmetry. This framework could guide and enable systematic discovery of such intriguing effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Feng Zhang, Yizhou Huang, Qing-Rui Wang, Peng Ye</p>
            <p>We develop a current-based construction of generalized symmetries in $(3+1)$D twisted $BF$ topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), focusing on intrinsically non-invertible higher-form symmetries and their mixed anomalies. Starting from the equations of motion, we extract conserved currents and exponentiate the corresponding charges to obtain topological symmetry operators. This gives a step-by-step procedure for constructing symmetry operators, fusion, and anomaly diagnostics directly from the continuum action. We focus on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a\wedge a\wedge b$ twist, where $a$'s and $b$ are 1-form and 2-form gauge fields, respectively. These theories realize non-Abelian $(3+1)$D TQFTs supporting Borromean-rings braiding and describe three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in condensed matter. For $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$, a microscopic realization is given by the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double model. Two distinct classes of conserved currents emerge: Type-I currents generate invertible higher-form symmetries with group-like fusion, while Type-II currents require additional consistency conditions on gauge-field configurations, leading to intrinsically non-invertible symmetries dressed by projectors. We compute the fusion algebra: invertible operators admit inverses, while non-invertible ones exhibit multi-channel fusion governed by projector fusion. We diagnose mixed anomalies by coupling multiple conserved currents to background gauge fields, revealing two outcomes: anomalies canceled by anomaly inflow from a higher-dimensional theory, and intrinsic gauging obstructions encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum theory. Overall, our results provide a unified and practical approach for constructing and characterizing higher-form symmetries, which can be extended to more general TQFTs and topological orders.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bobby Kaman, Jinho Lim, Yingkai Liu, Axel Hoffmann</p>
            <p>Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states.</p>

            <p>We perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations of the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice and resolve the long-standing question of its ground state in an unbiased and quantitatively controlled manner. We find compelling numerical evidence that the ground state is a gapped $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid, characterized by a finite topological entanglement entropy close to $\ln(4)$, the absence of both $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ and lattice symmetry breaking, and a variationally optimized ground-state energy well below competing Dirac spin liquid states. By exploiting full $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ symmetry and keeping up to 12,800 $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ multiplets, corresponding to more than one million $\mathrm{U}(1)$ states, we achieve unprecedented accuracy for two-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ quantum magnets. Finite-size scaling of energies and entanglement entropies supports a robust gapped phase in the two-dimensional limit, while a gapless critical state on narrow cylinders is identified as a proximate remnant of a Dirac spin-orbital liquid. Our results establish the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ honeycomb Heisenberg model as a concrete realization of a gapped $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid and provide robust numerical evidence for topological order in a highly symmetric two-dimensional quantum magnet.</p>

            <p>Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting qubits and microwave cavities. Niobium resonators are widely used in quantum science experiments, yet niobium's natural oxide layer contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits losses which have the power and temperature behavior expected for TLS. Moreover, the measurements agree with existing theoretical models. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels.</p>

We then highlight how AL enhances data efficiency across various data regimes, ranging from task-specific settings with limited data to the development of general-purpose datasets and large-scale models. We further provide a systematic overview of AL applications throughout the materials research pipeline, including computational simulation, composition and structural design, process optimization, and self-driving laboratory systems.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. M. Mostepanenko, G. L. Klimchitskaya</p>
            <p>We address the spatially nonlocal dielectric functions of graphene at any frequency derived starting fromthe first principles of thermal quantum field theory using the formalism of the polarization tensor. After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropic collective excitations of Bose gases in modified Newtonian dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Liu</p>
            <p>Collective excitations are fundamental in quantum many-body physics, yet their spectra have traditionally been studied within Newtonian dynamics. In this paper, we investigate collective excitations in Bose gases under Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We derive an anisotropic excitation spectrum in the MOND regime. This anisotropy arises directly from the intrinsic nonlinear structure of the MOND Poisson equation, forming a distinctive signature of the modified gravitational response. We then analyze the Jeans instability, obtaining analytic expressions for the direction-dependent critical wavelength and mass. These results advance our understanding of collective behavior in quantum systems under modified dynamics and establish clear theoretical signatures for testing MOND-like effects in quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Surface Phonon Hall Viscosity Induced Phonon Chirality and Nonreciprocity in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinava Chatterjee, Chao-Xing Liu</p>
            <p>The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons.</p>

            <h2>Deconfined quantum criticality with internal supersymmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Qiang Gao, Hui Yang, Yan-Qi Wang</p>
            <p>Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) describes direct, non-fine-tuned quantum phase transition between two ordered phases that break distinct and seemingly unrelated symmetries, providing a route to continuous phase transition beyond the conventional Ginzburg--Landau paradigm. In this work we extend the DQCP paradigm to systems with internal supersymmetry (SUSY), where the on-site Hilbert space furnishes a representation of a Lie superalgebra, and the Hamiltonian is invariant under the corresponding Lie supergroup. Focusing on the minimal supersymmetric generalization of spin $SU(2)$, namely $OSp(1|2)$, we propose a supersymmetric deconfined quantum critical point (sDQCP) between a phase that breaks internal $OSp(1|2)$ and a phase that instead breaks lattice rotation symmetry. We formulate a non-linear sigma model on the supersphere target space that captures the symmetry intertwinement characteristic of the sDQCP, and we further develop a gauge theory description to address its dynamical properties, including a heuristic argument for 3D XY critical behavior. Finally, we show that explicitly breaking $OSp(1|2)$ down to $SU(2)$ continuously connects our sDQCP to the conventional DQCP scenario.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-geometry-enabled Landau-Zener tunneling in singular flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanyu Long, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>Flat-band materials have attracted substantial interest for their intriguing quantum geometric effects. Here we investigate how singular flat bands (SFBs) respond to a static, uniform electric field and whether they can support single-particle dc transport. By constructing a minimal two-band lattice model, we show that away from the singular band crossing point (BCP), the Wannier-Stark (WS) spectrum of the flat band is well captured by an intraband Berry phase $\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}$. The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport. In contrast, near the BCP the interband Berry connection becomes prominent and drives Landau-Zener tunneling, which bends the flat-band WS ladder and delocalizes the SFB wavefunctions. Remarkably, this regime is governed solely by the maximal quantum distance $d$ through two geometric phases $(\theta,\varphi)$: $\theta$ characterizes the tunneling rate and $\varphi$ acts as a generalized Berry phase. These results highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in enabling nontrivial transport signatures in SFBs.</p>

            <p>Emissive metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronics due to their sharp color purity, inexpensive processing, and bandgap tunability. However, the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs has lagged behind due to challenges related to material and device stability, charge carrier transport, tunability into the ultraviolet spectrum, toxicity, and scalability. Here, we review the progress of both violet and ultraviolet MHP nanomaterials and light-emitting diodes, including materials synthesis and device fabrication across various crystal structures and dimensions (e.g., bulk thin films, 2D thin films, nanoplatelets, colloidal nanocrystals, and more) as well as lead-free platforms (e.g., rare-earth metal halide perovskites). By highlighting several pathways to continue the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs while also proposing tactics to overcome their outstanding challenges, we demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art violet and ultraviolet MHP materials and devices for important applications in public health, 3D printing, nanofabrication, and more.</p>

            <p>Kitaev iridates have been proposed as candidates for realizing an elusive quantum spin liquid (QSL) state, in which strong spin-orbit coupling and bond-directional exchange generate a highly frustrated and entangled ground state. However, all physical systems proposed to host this ground state, including Li$_2$IrO$_3$, Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, develop magnetic order at low temperatures due to competing interactions. Nonetheless, theoretical modeling of experimental data has shown that Kitaev interactions are still present, motivating the application of perturbations such as pressure, magnetic field, and chemical doping to drive the system into the QSL phase. Here we study $\beta$-Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$ with dilute levels of Ru, $x \lesssim 10\%$. Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape. This could provide a new window into the degeneracy, anisotropy, and competing interactions underlying the Kitaev QSL.</p>

            <h2>Shearing Off the Tree: Emerging Branch Structure and Born's Rule in an Equilibrated Multiverse</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Strasberg, Joseph Schindler</p>
            <p>Within the many worlds interpretation (MWI) it is believed that, as time passes on, the linearity of the Schrödinger equation together with decoherence generate an exponentially growing tree of branches where "everything happens", provided the branches are defined for a decohering basis. By studying an example, using exact numerical diagonalization of the Schrödinger equation to compute the decoherent histories functional, we find that this picture needs revision. Our example shows decoherence for histories defined at a few times, but a significant fraction (often the vast majority) of branches shows strong interference effects for histories of many times. In a sense made precise below, the histories independently sample an equilibrated quantum process, and, remarkably, we find that only histories that sample frequencies in accordance with Born's rule remain decoherent. Our results suggest that there is more structure in the many worlds tree than previously anticipated, influencing arguments of both proponents and opponents of the MWI.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced sensing of a weak Stark field under the influence of Aubry-André-Harper criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayan Sahoo, Debraj Rakshit</p>
            <p>The localization transition can be exploited as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in parameter estimation. We demonstrate that by employing different classes of localization inducing potentials, one can significantly enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Specifically, we focus on the precision measurement of the Stark strength parameter encoded in the low- and high-energy eigenstates of a one-dimensional fermionic lattice under the influence of Aubry-André-Harper localization-delocalization transition. For the ground state, we consider the single-particle system, in addition to the system at half filling. Our work reveals that Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) offers superior scaling with respect to the system size compared to the pure Stark case, leading to a better parameter estimation. However, experimental measurement of the QFI based on fidelity in a multibody system is a significant challenge. To address this, we suggest experimentally relevant operators that can be utilized to achieve precision surpassing the Heisenberg Limit (HL) or can even saturate the QFI scaling. These operators, relevant for practical experimental setups, provide a feasible pathway to harness the advantages offered by the localization-delocalization transition by exploiting two distinct localizing potentials for quantum-enhanced parameter estimation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Lajci, D. H. J. O'Dell, J. Mumford</p>
            <p>We consider the topological properties of the so-called central spin model that consists of $N$ identical spins coupled to a single distinguishable central spin which arises in physical systems such as circuit-QED and bosonic Josephson junctions coupled to an impurity atom. The model closely corresponds to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model except that the chain of sites in the SSH model is replaced by a chain of states in Fock space specifying the magnetization. We find that the model accommodates topologically protected eigenstates that are `Bell-cat' states consisting of a Schrödinger cat state of the $N$ spins that is maximally entangled with the central spin, and show how this state can be adiabatically created and moved along the chain by driving the central spin. The Bell-cat states are visualized by plotting their Wigner function and we explore their robustness against random noise by solving the master equation for the density matrix. We also explain the essential topological difference between identical spins and the excitations of a bosonic mode.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-induced fragmentation and dissipative time crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haowei Li, Wei Yi</p>
            <p>Time crystals are a peculiar state of matter. Their emergence hinges on ergodicity breaking, which typically originates from many-body localization or Floquet prethermalization. Here we propose a novel scheme for devising robust dissipative time crystals where the ergodicity is broken through symmetry-induced fragmentation. Building upon a U(1)-symmetry-induced Liouville-space fragmentation, we first propose a generic Liouvillian with long-time oscillations typical of time crystals. We then show that, even when the U(1) symmetry is broken, a prethermal time-crystal behavior survives, with distinct oscillation frequencies at different times of the steady-state approaching dynamics. Intriguingly, the stage-wise prethermal dynamics derive from Fermi statistics and the Liouvillian skin effect of our model -- as the excitations above the boundary-localized dark states can be mapped to the irreducible representations of the permutation group, the branching rules of the permutation group ensure the robustness of the prethermal time crystal. Our work paves the way for devising time crystals through Hilbert-space fragmentation. It also sheds light on the dynamic effects of non-Hermitian physics in many-body quantum open systems.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of engines exploiting non-classical resources. One of the most appealing is the energy provided by the inherent backaction of quantum measurements. While a handful of experiments have investigated the inner dynamics of engines fueled by measurement backaction, powering a task by such an engine is missing. Here we demonstrate the amplification of microwave signals by an engine fueled by repeated quantum measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon operating without a hot thermal source. Measuring the gain of this amplification constitutes a direct probing of the work output of the engine, in contrast with inferring the work by measuring the qubit state along its evolution. Observing a good agreement between both work estimation methods, our experiment validates the accuracy of the indirect method. We characterize the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, loss and drifts. Our experiment exemplifies the use of energy brought by quantum measurement backaction.</p>

            <p>While quantum measurements have been shown to constitute a resource for operating quantum thermal machines, the nature of the energy exchanges involved in the interaction between system and measurement apparatus is still under debate. In this work, we show that a microscopic model of the apparatus is necessary to unambiguously determine whether quantum measurements provide energy in the form of heat or work. We illustrate this result by considering a measurement-based refrigerator, made of a double quantum dot embedded in a two-terminal device, with the charge of one of the dots being continuously monitored. Tuning the parameters of the measurement device interpolates between a heat- and a work-fueled regimes with very different thermodynamic efficiency. Notably, we demonstrate a trade-off between a maximal thermodynamic efficiency when the measurement-based refrigerator is fueled by heat and a maximal measurement efficiency quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio in the work-fueled regime. Our analysis offers a new perspective on the nature of the energy exchanges occurring during a quantum measurement, paving the way for energy optimization in quantum protocols and quantum machines.</p>

            <p>The logarithmic corotational derivative is a key concept in rate-type constitutive relations in continuum mechanics. The derivative is defined in terms of the logarithmic spin tensor, which is a skew-symmetric tensor/matrix given by a relatively complex formula. Using a newly developed commutator based functional calculus, we derive a new representation formula for the logarithmic spin tensor. In addition to the result on the logarithmic corotational derivative we also use the newly developed functional calculus to answer some problems regarding the matrix logarithm and the monotonicity of stress-strain relations. These results document that the commutator based functional calculus is of general use in tensor/matrix analysis, and that the calculus allows one to seamlessly work with tensor/matrix valued functions and their derivatives.</p>

            <h2>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Thakur, Prabhat Prakash, Raghavan Ranganathan</p>
            <p>Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</p>

We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.</p>

            <p>Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications. In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional spatial partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that DistMLIP can simulate atomic systems 3.4x larger and up to 8x faster compared to previous multi-GPU methods.

            <p>Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.</p>

            <p>The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^†$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^†(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form $(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We find that only spatially random Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions can yield linear resistivity.</p>

            <h2>When higher-order interactions enhance synchronization: the case of the Kuramoto model on random hypergraphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Muolo, Hiroya Nakao, Marco Coraggio</p>
            <p>Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in complex systems, observed across a wide range of natural and engineered contexts. The Kuramoto model provides a foundational framework for understanding synchronization among coupled oscillators, traditionally assuming pairwise interactions. However, many real-world systems exhibit group and many-body interactions, which can be effectively modeled through hypergraphs. Previous studies suggest that higher-order interactions shrink the attraction basin of the synchronous state, making it harder to reach and potentially impairing synchronization, despite enriching the dynamics. In this work, we show that this is not always the case. Through a numerical study of higher-order Kuramoto models on random hypergraphs, we find that while strong higher-order interactions do generally work against synchronization, weak higher-order interactions can actually enhance it when combined with pairwise ones. This result is further corroborated by a cost-benefit analysis: under a constrained budget of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, a mixed allocation involving both consistently achieves higher synchronization than relying on either interaction type alone. These findings provide new insights into the role of higher-order interactions in shaping collective dynamics and point to design principles for optimizing synchronization in complex systems.</p>

            <h2>Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Yin, Zujian Dai, Xinyang Pan, Lixin He</p>
            <p>Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</p>

            <p>Trained attention layers exhibit striking and reproducible spectral structure of the weights, including low-rank collapse, bulk deformation, and isolated spectral outliers, yet the origin of these phenomena and their implications for generalization remain poorly understood. We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks generated from the attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass theory, and approximate message passing, we obtain an exact high-dimensional characterization of training and test error, interpolation and recovery thresholds, and the spectrum of the key and query matrices. Our theory predicts the full singular-value distribution of the trained query-key map, including low-rank structure and isolated spectral outliers, in qualitative agreement with observations in more realistic transformers. Finally, for targets with power-law spectra, we show that learning proceeds through sequential spectral recovery, leading to the emergence of power-law scaling laws.</p>

            <h2>Triadic percolation on multilayer networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanlin Sun, Filippo Radicchi, Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</p>

            <p>In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances.

Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</p>

            <p>We theoretically propose a quantum heat engine using a setup consisting of a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate placed in a Fabry-Pérot cavity where the optical field carries orbital angular momentum. We first show that the cavity-enhanced light-atom coupling leads to the emergence of polaritonic modes whose character can be reversibly switched between photonlike and phononlike by detuning sweeps, allowing work extraction governed by distinct reservoirs. We investigate the dependence of the engine efficiency on the orbital angular momentum. Beyond ideality, we discuss finite-time scenarios based on shortcuts to adiabaticity such that the efficiency retains its ideal-operation value, despite finite-time operation. Our analysis identifies orbital angular momentum as a control knob that can reconfigure the performance of such quantum heat engines.</p>

            <h2>Fast Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kousuke Nakano, Stefano Battaglia, Jürg Hutter</p>
            <p>Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr{ö}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or extensive datasets, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as Density Functional Theory. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires 6$N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces. This paper presents a way to replace the 6$N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the unbiased VMC forces with those obtained by CCSD(T) calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones. Our benchmark test also reveals that the unbiased VMC forces yield very consistent values with hybrid and meta GGAs, but do not necessarily yield values that are very close to those of CCSD(T).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitry S. Ageev, Yulia A. Ageeva</p>
            <p>We develop a basis--covariant one--loop renormalization framework for two interacting real scalars in $D=4-\epsilon$ with the most general two--derivative Lorentz--violating quadratic form, allowing anisotropic spatial gradients and direction--dependent kinetic mixing, together with general cubic and quartic interactions forming RG complete set of operators at one-loop. In dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction we compute the full set of one--loop UV divergences and obtain closed beta functions for quartic and cubic couplings, masses. The pole coefficients admit a universal spectral representation as angular averages over the direction--dependent eigenvalues and projectors of the UV kinetic matrix; all anisotropy dependence enters through a single universal kernel admitting two--particle phase--space interpretation. We classify fixed points and fixed manifolds and show, in particular, that anisotropy restricts the existence of the coupled Wilson--Fisher--type fixed point. When the cross--gradients are turned on the coefficients in beta functions are governed by six phase--space weights admitting interpretation in terms of encoding ``populations'' and ``coherences'' of the UV normal modes.</p>

            <p>Counterdiabatic driving realizes parameter displacement of an energy eigenstate of a given parametrized Hamiltonian using the adiabatic gauge potential. In this paper, we propose a universal method of digitized counterdiabatic driving, constructing the adiabatic gauge potential in a digital way with the idea of universal counterdiabatic driving. This method has three advantages over existing universal counterdiabatic driving and/or digitized counterdiabatic driving: it does not introduce any many-body and/or nonlocal interactions to an original target Hamiltonian; it can incorporate infinite nested commutators, which constitute the adiabatic gauge potential; and it gives explicit expression of rotation angles for digital implementation. We show the consistency of our method to the exact theory in an analytical way and the effectiveness of our method with the aid of numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs</h2>

            <p>Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($\lambda_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $\Delta \mathbf{\theta}$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.</p>

            <h2>Resolving Gauge Ambiguities of the Berry Connection in Non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ievgen I. Arkhipov</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting uniquely defined Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that a boundary-localized periodic (Floquet) drive can induce nontrivial long-range correlations in a non-interacting fermionic chain which is additionally subject to boundary dissipation. Surprisingly, we find that this phenomenon occurs even when the corresponding isolated bulk is in a trivial gapped phase with exponentially decaying correlations. We argue that this boundary-drive induced non-equilibrium transition (as witnessed through the correlation matrix) is driven by a resonance mechanism whereby the drive frequency bridges bulk energy gaps, allowing boundary-injected particles and holes to propagate and mediate long-range correlations into the bulk. We also numerically establish that when the drive bridges a particle-hole gap, the induced long-range order scales as a power law with the bulk pairing potential ($\chi \sim \gamma^2$). Our results highlight the potential of localized coherent driving for generating macroscopic order in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Techniques for detecting critical phenomena -- phase transitions where correlation length diverges and small perturbations have large effects -- have been developed across at least eight fields of application over nine decades. We document this convergence pattern. The physicist's correlation length $\xi$, the cardiologist's DFA scaling exponent $\alpha$, the financial analyst's Hurst exponent $H$, and the machine learning engineer's spectral radius $\chi$ all measure correlation decay rate, detecting the same critical signatures under different notation. Citation analysis reveals minimal cross-domain awareness during the formative period (1987--2010): researchers in biomedicine, finance, machine learning, power systems, and traffic flow developed equivalent techniques independently, each with distinct notation and terminology. We present Metatron Dynamics, a framework derived from distributed systems engineering, as a candidate ninth independent discovery -- strengthening the convergence pattern while acknowledging that as authors of both the framework and this analysis, external validation would strengthen this claim. Correspondence testing on the 2D Ising model confirms that measures from multiple frameworks correctly identify the critical regime at $T_c = 2.269$. We argue that repeated independent discovery establishes criticality mathematics as fundamental public knowledge, with implications for cross-disciplinary education and research accessibility. Because these findings affect fields beyond mathematics and physics, we include a plain-language summary in Appendix B for non-specialist readers.</p>

We report single-shot interferometric measurements of spontaneous vortex nucleation in a room-temperature organic exciton-polariton condensate. From hundreds of independent realizations we find random vortex-core positions and unbiased circulation, consistent with intrinsically stochastic, unpinned defect formation. The mean vortex number scales with pump power above threshold with an exponent consistent with Kibble-Zurek freeze-out in a driven-dissipative condensate. Using reconstructed phase maps we obtain single-shot flow fields, compute the incompressible component, and extract kinetic-energy spectra. Vortex-containing realizations develop a robust Kolmogorov-like segment with Einc(k) proportional to k^(-5/3) over a finite k range, indicating the onset of turbulent spectral scaling in a quantum fluid of light. These results establish single-shot access to phase and flow as a direct route to quantifying stochastic defect formation and emerging turbulence in polariton condensates.</p>

            <p>The formation of excitonic insulator phases in quantum materials is often masked by structural distortions caused by the coupling between electronic and phononic order parameters. Here we show that the candidate material Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is characterized by a metastable excitonic insulating phase that is decoupled from the lattice, and that can be stabilized for sufficiently high applied magnetic fields. By considering the interplay between the excitonic and structural instabilities, we predict a magnetic field induced transition from the low-temperature structurally distorted semiconducting phase to an undistorted excitonic insulator phase with ground state loop currents. Before the transition, the existence of a latent excitonic phase can be detected by the magnetic field softening of the phonon mode associated with the structural distortion. These results highlight an unbiased route towards the disentanglement of the coupled excitonic-structural transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, and uncover a general mechanism for magnetic field control of competing phases in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Plasmons, arising from the collective motion of electrons, can interact strongly with electromagnetic fields or photons; this capability has been exploited across a broad range of applications, from chemical reactivity to biosensing. Recently, there has been growing interest in plasmons for applications in quantum information processing. Electrons floating on liquid helium provide an exceptionally clean, disorder-free system and have emerged as a promising platform for this purpose. In this work, we establish this system as a tunable plasmon-photon hybrid platform. We demonstrate strong coupling between floating-electron plasmons and radio-frequency (RF) photons confined in an LC resonator. Time-resolved measurements reveal coherent oscillatory energy exchange between the plasmonic and photonic modes, providing direct evidence of their coherent coupling. These results represent a step towards cavity quantum electrodynamics with a floating-electron plasmon coupled to a resonator. Furthermore, the LC resonator serves as a sensitive probe of electron-on-helium physics, enabling the observation of the Wigner crystal transition and a quantitative study of the temperature-dependent plasmon decay arising from ripplon-induced scattering.</p>

At hole filling $\nu = 2$ per moiré unit cell, the noninteracting system hosts a Dirac semimetal with graphene-like low-energy bands in the moiré Brillouin zone. At small twist angles, the Fermi velocity is reduced and interactions dominate the low-temperature behavior. A strong-coupling analysis identifies insulating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground-state candidates, characterized by spin-density modulations set by the moiré scale. Using a realistic continuum model with long-range Coulomb interactions, we perform self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the competition between these states. Varying the twist angle or pressure drives a transition from a Dirac semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulator, which breaks SU(2) spin rotation and two-fold lattice rotation symmetries. Within a renormalization group analysis of the most general symmetry-allowed low-energy field theory, we show that this semimetal-to-insulator transition is continuous and belongs to the (2+1)D relativistic Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class with $N = 2$ four-component Dirac fermions. Finite heterostrain, relevant in realistic samples, induces a crossover from Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality at intermediate temperatures to conventional (2+1)D Heisenberg criticality at the lowest temperatures. Further decreasing the twist angle can cause a level crossing from the antiferromagnetic insulator into a ferromagnetic insulator with spin-split bands. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical framework that complements and elucidates recent experiments in twisted double bilayer WSe$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Temporal Entanglement Transitions in the Periodically Driven Ising Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karun Gadge, Abhinav Prem, Rishabh Jha</p>
            <p>Periodically driven quantum systems can host non-equilibrium phenomena without static analogs, including in their entanglement dynamics. Here, we discover $temporal$ $entanglement$ $transitions$ (TET) in a Floquet spin chain, which correspond to a quantum phase transition in the spectrum of the entanglement Hamiltonian and are signaled by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking. We identify the symmetry principles underlying these transitions: they appear when the driven Hamiltonian preserves global symmetry (here, $\mathbb{Z}_2$), the initial state respects this symmetry, and the reduced density matrix carries weight in both subsystem-parity sectors, with TET occurring precisely when the sector weights become equal (given the previous two conditions are also satisfied). Intriguingly, we find these transitions across a broad range of driving frequencies (from adiabatic to high-frequency regime) and independently of drive details, where they manifest as periodic, sharp entanglement spectrum reorganizations marked by the Schmidt-gap closure, a vanishing entanglement echo, and symmetry-quantum-number flips, while remaining invisible to conventional local observables. At high frequencies, the entanglement Hamiltonian acquires an intrinsic timescale decoupled from the drive period, rendering the transitions genuine steady-state features. Finite-size scaling reveals universal critical behavior with correlation-length exponent $\nu=1$, matching equilibrium Ising universality despite its emergence from purely dynamical mechanisms decoupled from static criticality. Our work establishes TET as novel features in Floquet quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Quench spectroscopy of amplitude modes in a one-dimensional critical phase</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunsoo Ha, David A. Huse, Rhine Samajdar</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of an amplitude (Higgs-like) mode in the gapless phase of the $(1+1)$D XXZ spin chain. Unlike conventional settings where amplitude modes arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking, here, we identify a symmetry-preserving underdamped excitation on top of a Luttinger-liquid ground state. Using nonequilibrium quench spectroscopy, we demonstrate that this mode manifests as oscillations of U(1)-symmetric observables following a sudden quench. By combining numerical simulations with Bethe-ansatz analyses, we trace its microscopic origin to specific families of string excitations. We further discuss experimental pathways to detect this mode in easy-plane quantum magnets and programmable quantum simulators. Our results showcase the utility of quantum quenches as a powerful tool to probe collective excitations, beyond the scope of linear response.</p>

            <h2>A matter-wave Fabry-Pérot cavity in the ultrastrong driving regime</h2>

            <p>When the length of an optical cavity is modulated, theory predicts exponential concentration of energy around particular space-time trajectories. Viewed stroboscopically, photons in such a driven cavity propagate as if in a curved spacetime, with black hole and white hole event horizons corresponding to unstable and stable fixed points of the evolution. Such phenomena have resisted direct experimental realization due to the difficulty of relativistically accelerating massive cavity mirrors. We report results of an experiment which overcomes this limitation by exchanging the roles of light and matter. A matter wave endowed with quasi-relativistic dispersion is confined between two barriers made of light, one of which is periodically translated at speeds comparable to the matter wave group velocity. In this strongly-modulated cavity we observe the emergence of the predicted bright and dark fixed point trajectories, and demonstrate that changing the modulation waveform can vary the number of fixed points and exchange their stability character. We observe signatures of nontrivial dynamics beyond those predicted for photons, and attribute them to residual curvature in the dispersion relation. In addition to experimentally realizing and characterizing cavity dynamics in the ultra-strong driving regime, these results point the way to implementations of related dynamics in electro-optic materials, with potential applications in pulse generation and signal compression.</p>

            <h2>Efficient high-harmonic generation in van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI$_2$ crystals</h2>

            <p>Layered NbOX$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Cl,\,Br,\,I}$), a member of the van der Waals ferroelectric family, exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity and pronounced nonlinear optical responses, making it a promising candidate for integrated nanophotonics applications. While previous studies have emphasized the material's strong second-order nonlinear responses, higher-order nonlinear responses are still mostly unexplored. This work systematically investigates NbOI$_2$ using high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy. Driven by an intense mid-infrared laser field centered at $\sim4~\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength, highly anisotropic odd- and even-order harmonics up to the 16th order are generated at a low peak intensity of $0.4~\mathrm{TW\,cm^{-2}}$, extending beyond the material's bandgap. Both bulk and flake forms of NbOI$_2$ display pronounced harmonic emission from the near-infrared to the deep-ultraviolet spectral region, with a notably high overall conversion efficiency compared to other known materials. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that even-order harmonics remain aligned with the crystal polar axis regardless of the driving-field orientation, whereas odd-order harmonics are dynamically affected. First-principles calculations suggest that the flat valence band associated with Peierls dimerization enhances HHG efficiency through electron correlation. These findings provide fresh perspectives on HHG in van der Waals ferroelectric materials and facilitate the development of compact and tunable quantum light sources.</p>

            <p>Twisted graphene provides a tunable platform for studying superconductivity in two dimensions. In the presence of electric currents and magnetic fields, vortices determine the phenomenological properties of the material. Related studies usually address bulk properties averaging over ensembles of vortices. Here, we employ a gate-defined Josephson junction as a single-vortex sensor, enabling direct access to individual vortex dynamical events. Our measurements reveal that, at elevated temperatures (T > 100 mK), vortices enter the superconducting leads via classical thermal activation over energy barriers. At lower temperatures (T < 90 mK), we observe macroscopic quantum tunneling through these barriers. The data are consistent with a sharp, first-order type quantum-to-classical transition. From our measurements, we extract vortex entry and exit energy barriers on the order of a few Kelvin and estimate the barrier thickness to be approximately 100 nm, corresponding to about one tenth of the device width.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting properties of transition metal dichalcogenides in proximity to a conventional superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Kayatz, Annica M. Black-Schaffer, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) hold relevance for spin-triplet superconducting phases due to their inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling, but the majority of studies have so far focused on oversimplified models. In this work, we consider a TMD monolayer using a three-orbital model with anisotropic couplings and investigate the emergent superconducting properties when it is placed in proximity to a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the multiorbital nature of the TMDs lead to superconducting gaps not only at zero energy, but also at higher energies, so-called hybridization gaps, which exhibit a complex structure due to the anisotropic couplings, challenging their spectral measurement. Moreover, we find that the inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling induces a spin splitting and a spin polarization along the $z$-direction, which correlates with the emergence of mixed spin-triplet superconducting pairs. These spin-triplet pair correlations appear in the monolayer as a proximity-induced effect due to the impact of the Ising spin-orbit field on conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity. Taking realistic parameters for a $\text{MoS}_2$ monolayer, we show that the Ising field is strong enough to induce spin-triplet pair correlations of the same magnitude as their spin-singlet counterparts. We also include Rashba spin-orbit coupling, naturally emerging in a heterostructure and find that it induces equal spin-triplet superconducting pairs that compete with the mixed spin-triplet pairs induced by the Ising spin-orbit coupling. Our findings help understand the superconducting properties of TMDs in proximity to conventional superconductors.</p>

            <p>In a one-dimensional ferromagnet-superconductor nanowire, magnetism can suppress superconductivity except where the Zeeman field is suppressed, for example domain wall superconductivity (DWS) near magnetic domain walls or multi-domain-averaged superconductivity (MDAS) in multi-domain states where the net magnetization over the coherence length averages to nearly zero. Here we study full-shell InAs/EuS/Al nanowires using scanning SQUID magnetometry and transport, and find superconductivity in the Al shell only when the EuS is in a multi-domain state, consistent with both DWS and MDAS, and absent in the saturated single-domain state. Scanning SQUID magnetometry further shows that the EuS magnetic texture is position dependent and reconfigurable by small changes in external magnetic field, including moving a well-defined domain wall at $\approx$5.5 $\mu$m/mT with sub-mT fields, implying that any associated localized superconducting region would likewise be movable. Such magnetic texture controlled superconductivity along a nanowire may be useful for topological qubits, Andreev spin qubits, superconducting logic, and memory devices.</p>

            <h2>Translational and Rotational Temperature Difference in Coexisting Phases of Inertial Active Dumbbells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhasish Chaki, Hartmut Löwen</p>
            <p>We investigate the effect of translational and rotational inertia on motility-induced phase separation in underdamped active dumbbells and identify the emergence of four distinct kinetic temperatures across the coexisting phases-unlike in overdamped systems. We find that the dilute, gas-like phase consistently exhibits a higher translational kinetic temperature than the dense, liquid-like phase, with this difference amplified by increasing the rotational inertia. Rotational kinetic temperatures display a similar trend, with the dense phase remaining colder than the dilute phase; however, in this case the temperature difference grows with translational inertia and activity, while becoming practically independent of rotational inertia. This counterintuitive behavior arises from the interplay of activity-driven collisions with both translational and rotational inertia in the coexisting phases. Our results highlight the critical role of translational and rotational inertia in shaping the kinetic temperature landscape of motility-induced phase separation and offer new insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of active matter.</p>

            <p>Topological quantum computation encodes quantum information in the internal fusion space of non-Abelian anyonic quasiparticles, whose braiding implements logical gates. This goes beyond Abelian topological order (TO) such as the toric code, as its anyons lack internal structure. However, the simplest non-Abelian generalizations of the toric code do not support universality via braiding alone. Here we demonstrate that such minimally non-Abelian TOs can be made universal by treating anyon fusion as a computational primitive. We prepare a 54-qubit TO wavefunction associated with the smallest non-Abelian group, $S_3$, on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor. This phase of matter exhibits cyclic anyon fusion rules, known to underpin universality, which we evidence by trapping a single non-Abelian anyon on the torus. We encode logical qutrits in the nonlocal fusion space of non-Abelian fluxes and, by combining an entangling braiding operation with anyon charge measurements, realize a universal topological gate set and read-out, which we further demonstrate by topologically preparing a magic state. This work establishes $S_3$ TO as simple enough to be prepared efficiently, yet rich enough to enable universal topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p>The ability to steer polariton flow on-demand holds significant promise towards nanophotonic applications and photonic circuitry. Polariton canalization, exhibiting intrinsic collimation and diffractionless transport, emerges as a promising solution without guiding structures. However, earlier demonstrations have been restricted to certain crystal surfaces with intrinsic hyperbolic responses and operated in the linear regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate canalization of nonlinear exciton polariton condensates with optical reconfigurability in a birefringent CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal without intrinsic hyperbolic response. By embedding the birefringent perovskite crystal into a planar microcavity, the interplay between cavity transverse-electric-transverse-magnetic splitting and crystalline birefringence produces an anisotropic band geometry with a hyperbolic-flat-parabolic evolution of polaritonic isofrequency contours (IFCs). Nonresonant pumping drives exciton polariton condensation onto flat far-field contours with nonlinear emission amplification, leading to coherent canalized flows with over twentyfold collimation with respect to arc-shaped contours. Reconfiguring the optical pumping-spot size allows switching the nonlinear polariton condensates into hyperbolic and parabolic IFC regimes, leading to divergent propagation behaviour with collimating reconfiguration. Our study reveals a distinct canalization framework for shaping the nonlinear exciton-polariton condensate flows, opening opportunities for all-optical polaritonic logic circuits based on stabilized nonlinear quantum interconnects.</p>

            <h2>Observation of dislocation bound states and skin effects in non-Hermitian Chern insulators</h2>

            <p>The confluence of non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding an edge dislocations-antidislocation pair in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. We experimentally identify the emergence of bulk exceptional points (EPs) via spectral coalescence and phase rigidity analysis. We demonstrate that the NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states driven by these EPs under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings, therefore, pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.</p>

            <p>Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.</p>

            <p>In commensurate twisted homobilayers, purely radial Rashba spin-orbit fields can emerge. We employ first-principles calculations to investigate the band structures and the spin-orbit fields close to the high-symmetry points $K$ and $\Gamma$ of several commensurate twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers: WSe$_2$, NbSe$_2$, and WTe$_2$. The observed in-plane spin textures are mostly radial, and the main features are successfully reproduced using a model Hamiltonian based on two effective mass models including spin-orbit coupling, and a general (spin-conserving) interlayer coupling. Extracting the model Hamiltonian parameters through fitting of several twisted supercells, we find a twist angle dependency of the magnitude of the radial Rashba field, which is symmetric not only around the untwisted cases ($\Theta=0^\circ$ and $\Theta=60^\circ$), but also around $\Theta=30^\circ$. Furthermore, we observe that the interlayer coupling between the $K/K'$-points of the two layers decreases with the increase of the size of the commensurate supercells. Hence, peaks of high interlayer coupling can occur only for twist angles, where small commensurate supercells are possible. Exploring different lateral displacements between the layers, we confirm that the relevant symmetry protecting the radial Rashba is an in-plane 180$^\circ$ rotation axis. We additionally investigate the effects of atomic relaxation and modulation of the interlayer distance. Our calculations on WTe$_2$ bilayers show that their lack of $C_3$ symmetry results in spin textures that are neither radial nor tangential. Our results offer fundamental microscopic insights that are particularly relevant to engineering spin-charge conversion schemes based on twisted layered materials.</p>

            <h2>Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naïmo Davier, Ludovic D.C. Jaubert</p>
            <p>Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface can be interpreted as an effective Fermi surface in the spectrum of the parent system, acting as a tunable energy selector despite the absence of particle filling. This effective Fermi surface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jesús Fernández, Loïc Vanel, Antoine Bérut</p>
            <p>This study demonstrates that the free-surface flow dynamics of dense piles of contactless silica microparticles depend on the resting period prior to flow. Microfluidic rotating drum experiments reveal that longer resting times lead to delayed flow onsets and reduced flow velocities, both evolving logarithmically with the resting time. These aging-like effects are more pronounced for thermally driven creep flows in piles with initial tilting angle below the athermal angle of repose, in contrast to piles initially tilted above this repose angle, where gravity-driven flows tend to gradually erase aging effects. Moreover, we show that the packing fraction does not change during the resting period, and that aging occurs in both monodisperse and polydisperse piles, indicating that crystallization is not required for the time-dependent behavior to appear. Remarkably, vigorous agitation that re-disperses the particles fully restores the piles to their initial state, demonstrating that the observed effects are not due to sample degradation. These findings evidence a form of aging in quiescent suspensions intermediate between colloidal and granular media, where thermal fluctuations, still significant relative to particle weight, progressively stabilize the system, making it more resistant to flow and deformation.</p>

            <p>The particle number $N$ can be used as a quantitative gauge of non-Gaussianity.

For an ideal gas with $N$ insufficiently large for the thermodynamic limit, the velocity distribution that maximises Havrda-Charvát entropy departs markedly from the Maxwell--Boltzmann (Gaussian) form obtained in that limit. We explore how five standard normality tests -- Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cramér--von Mises, Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk -- respond to samples drawn from this finite-$N$ equilibrium distribution. A large-scale Monte Carlo study maps the tests' statistical power across system size $N$ and sample size $n$, providing practical reference tables and a heuristic scaling law, visualised as a contour plot, that together indicate when finite-size effects remain detectable.</p>

            <p>We investigated the behavior of lead titanate (PbTiO3) up to 100 GPa, both at room temperature and upon laser heating, using synchrotron X ray diffraction combined with density functional theory (DFT) computations. At the high pressure temperature (PT) conditions produced in laser heated diamond anvil cells, PbTiO3 dissociates into PbO and TiO2, consistent with our DFT computations showing that decomposition becomes enthalpically favored above 65 GPa. In contrast, on room temperature compression, PbTiO3 persists in the tetragonal I4mcm phase up to at least 100 GPa. Laser heating produces distinct PbO phases: a compressed form of alpha PbO and a previously unreported delta PbO polymorph, both of which transform to beta PbO on decompression. The calculations predict that alpha PbO undergoes pressure-induced band gap closure, metallizing above 70 GPa, whereas the delta and beta phases remain semiconducting with a band gap above 1 eV even at megabar pressures. The experimental and confirming theoretical results reveal an unanticipated dimension of the behavior of PbTiO3, showing that distinct equilibrium and metastable phases can be stabilized along different PT synthesis paths.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Martín-Roca, Daniel Escobar Ortiz, Chantal Valeriani, Horacio Serna</p>
            <p>Collective motion is ubiquitous in active systems at all length and time scales. The mechanisms behind such collective motion usually are alignment interactions between active particles, effective alignment after collisions between agents or symmetry-breaking fluctuations induced by passive species in active suspensions. In this article, we introduce a new type of collective motion in the shape of a traveling band induced purely by confinement, where no explicit or effective alignment are prescribed among active agents. We study a suspension of run-and-tumble particles confined in microchannels comprising asymmetric boundaries: one flat wall and one array of funnel-like obstacles. We study the phase behavior of the confined active suspension upon changes in the packing fraction and the persistence length to define the stability region of the traveling band. We characterize the traveling band structurally and dynamically and study its stability with respect to the tilt angle of the obstacles. Lastly, we describe the mechanism of motion of the band, which resembles the tracked locomotion of some heavy vehicles like tractors, finding that a counter-flux of active particles in the lower part of the band, explained in terms of source-sink and vacancy diffusion mechanisms, is the facilitator of the traveling band and sustains its motion. We name this new collective phenomenon confinement-induced tracked locomotion</p>

            <h2>Tunneling in multi-site mesoscopic quantum Hall circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. B. Karki</p>
            <p>Transport properties of single- and two-site mesoscopic quantum Hall (QH) circuits at high transparencies can be described in terms of the lowest-order backscattering processes, enabling a mapping to the boundary sine-Gordon model. We show that this description breaks down in circuits with four or more sites, where higher-order backscattering processes become relevant and qualitatively modify the low-energy physics, while remaining exactly marginal in three-site geometries. Focusing on the four-site circuit, we derive an effective low-energy theory that captures the resulting interaction-driven physics and reveal the emergence of unique quantum-critical points. In the vicinity of these critical points, we obtain universal conductance and scaling behavior and establish the robustness of the associated non-Fermi liquid physics. We further introduce tunneling in multichannel multi-site QH circuits and propose a promising route for realizing diverse quantum-critical phenomena. We show that a boundary sine-Gordon description can be restored in multichannel multi-site QH circuits by appropriately looping selected edge channels, a procedure that is experimentally feasible. Finally, we analyze the non-equilibrium heating effects relevant to transport measurements in QH circuits. Altogether, our results establish multi-site QH circuits as a versatile and highly controllable platform for simulating interaction-driven quantum critical phenomena.</p>

            <h2>A path to superconductivity via strong short-range repulsion in a spin-polarized band</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Dong, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>We predict that the spin-polarized electrons in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with strong electron-electron repulsion gives rise to f-wave pairing. The key point is that the first-order interaction, which is usually pair-breaking, vanishes or nearly vanishes in certain f-wave channels due to symmetry constraints. As a result, these f-wave pairing channels are governed by the subleading-order processes which enable pairing when the perturbation theory is controlled. We illustrate this using the Hubbard model on the triangular lattice with on-site and nearest-neighbor repulsion, where we find a $T_c\sim 1\% $ of electron's bandwidth. For a general screened interaction, the same idea works asymptotically, but a third-order calculation is needed to fully determine the strength of f-wave pairing.</p>

            <h2>Collapse of the superconducting order parameter in Ising superconductors with Rashba spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. S. Harms, M. Hein, W. Belzig</p>
            <p>Ising superconductors have attracted quite some attention recently, due to their resilience against magnetic fields way beyond the Pauli-paramagnetic limit. Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs.</p>

Both linear and quadratic vibrational interactions are taken into account. It was found that phonon scattering accompanying tunneling leads not only to a broadening of the energy spectrum of the transitions, but also to a deterioration in resonance. The results obtained are consistent with measurements of ultrasonic attenuation in Al2O3:Ni, GaAs:Mn and in GaAs:Cu doped crystals. A notable feature of E$ \times $e tunneling is the existence of a range of values for quadratic vibration interaction, in which the tunneling remains coherent at sufficiently high temperatures.</p>

            <p>Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) offers a powerful route to bridging the materials and pressure gaps between surface science and powder catalysis. Using a newly developed IRAS setup optimised for dielectric single crystals, we investigate CO adsorption on the model single-atom catalyst Rh/Fe3O4(001). IRAS resolves three species: monocarbonyls at isolated, twofold-coordinated Rh adatoms, monocarbonyls at fivefold-coordinated Rh atoms embedded in the surface, and gem-dicarbonyls at isolated, twofold-coordinated Rh adatoms. Under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, RhCO monocarbonyl species at adatom sites dominate. Rh(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl formation is kinetically hindered and occurs predominantly through CO-induced dissociation of Rh dimers rather than sequential adsorption of two CO molecules at an isolated, twofold Rh adatom. The sequential-adsorption pathway to Rh(CO)2 becomes accessible at millibar CO pressures as evidenced by near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy (NAP-STM). These findings link the UHV behaviour to that expected under realistic reaction conditions. Assignments of the vibrational frequencies to individual species rely on isotopic labelling, thermal treatments, and a review of previous SPM, XPS, and TPD data, supported by density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. While theory provides qualitative insight, such as the instability of dicarbonyls on fivefold-coordinated Rh atoms, it does not yet reproduce experimental frequencies quantitatively and is sensitive to the computational parameters, highlighting the need for robust experimental benchmarks. The spectroscopic fingerprints established here provide a reliable foundation for identifying Rh coordination environments in oxide-supported single-atom catalysts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Pelissetto, Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum dynamics generated by quantum quenches (QQs) of the Hamiltonian parameters in many-body systems, focusing on protocols that cross first-order and continuous quantum transitions, both in finite-size systems and in the thermodynamic limit. As a paradigmatic example, we consider the quantum Ising chain in the presence of homogeneous transverse ($g$) and longitudinal ($h$) magnetic fields. This model exhibits a continuous quantum transition (CQT) at $g=g_c$ and $h=0$, and first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) driven by $h$ along the line $h=0$ ($g<g_c$). In the integrable limit $h=0$, the system can be mapped onto a quadratic fermionic theory; however, any nonvanishing longitudinal field breaks integrability and the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian is generally expected to enter a chaotic regime. We analyze QQs in which the longitudinal field is suddenly changed from a negative value $h_i < 0$ to a positive value $h_f>0$. We focus on values of $h_f$ such that the spectrum of the post-QQ Hamiltonian $H(g,h_f)$ lies in the chaotic regime, where thermalization may emerge at asymptotically long times. We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics for different values of $g$, finding qualitatively distinct behaviors for $g > g_c$ (where the chain is in the disordered phase), for $g = g_c$ (QQ across the CQT), and for $g<g_c$ (QQ across the FOQT line).</p>

A mapping between a biased monitored qubit and a classical ``Run-and-Tumble" active particle is studied. We demonstrate that the competition between coherent Rabi driving (analogous to active motility) and measurement-induced feedback bias (analogous to persistence) mimics the behavior of biological swimmers. This framework provides a picture of measurement-induced phase transitions using the language of active matter and offering a novel pathway for designing dissipative noisy quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ewan McCulloch, Romain Vasseur, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>In charged fluids obeying particle-hole symmetry, such as the Dirac fluid in graphene, charge transport is diffusive despite the presence of ballistically propagating sound waves: sound waves "hydrodynamically decouple" from the slower charge fluctuations. For quasi-one-dimensional fluids, we show that this symmetry-protected charge diffusion is not smoothly connected to the normal diffusion that arises when momentum conservation is broken by noise (or static impurities). Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients. Our results highlight the limits of zero-noise extrapolation for predicting dynamical quantities like diffusion constants.</p>

            <p>Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</p>

            <p>Cryogenic photon sensing for high-energy physics motivates photosensor technologies that combine large-area scalability with internal gain and stable operation at low temperature. Amorphous selenium is a promising photoconductor, yet its field- and temperature-dependent transport and avalanche response in lateral geometries have not been systematically established. This work reports field-resolved photocurrent measurements of lateral a-Se devices from 93 K to 297 K under 401 nm excitation at fields up to 120 V/um. Below avalanche onset, the external quantum efficiency was described by the Onsager model, yielding effective post-thermalization separations that decrease with decreasing temperature. The field-assisted detrapping region was evaluated using several transport models, with the data favoring field-assisted hopping and thermally-assisted tunneling as the mechanisms that best capture the temperature evolution of the photocurrent. The boundaries between field-assisted detrapping, transport-limited conduction, and avalanche shift with temperature; at 93 K the response transitions directly from detrapping into avalanche. Avalanche multiplication was analyzed using the Lucky-drift model. These results provide the first systematic characterization of cryogenic avalanche behavior in lateral a-Se detectors and establish quantitative trends relevant to low-temperature, high-gain photodetector design.</p>

            <p>Twisted oxide membranes represent a promising platform for exploring moire physics and emergent quantum phenomena. However, the presence of amorphous interfacial dead layers in conventional oxide heterostructures impedes coherent coupling and suppresses moire-induced interactions. While high-temperature thermal treatments can facilitate interfacial bonding, additional care is needed for materials containing volatile elements, where elevated temperatures may cause elemental loss. This study demonstrates the realization of atomically coherent, chemically bonded interface in twisted NaNbO3 heterostructures through controlled oxygen-annealing treatment. Atomic-resolution imaging and spectroscopy reveal ordered perovskite registry accompanied by systematic lattice contraction and modified electronic structure at the twisted interface, providing signatures of chemical reconstruction rather than physical adhesion. This reconstructed interface mediates highly asymmetric strain propagation in which the bottom membrane remains nearly relaxed while the top membrane accommodates substantial shear strain, thereby establishing a strain gradient that enables long-range electromechanical coupling throughout the twisted oxide membranes. By resolving the nature of the reconstructed interface, these findings establish a robust pathway for achieving coherent and strain-tunable oxide moire superlattices, opening pathways to engineer emergent ferroic and electronic functionalities.</p>

            <p>Generative diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for sampling high-dimensional distributions, yet they typically rely on white gaussian noise and noise schedules to destroy and reconstruct information. Here, we demonstrate that driving the generative process out of equilibrium using active, temporally correlated noise sources fundamentally alters the information thermodynamics of the system. We show that coupling the data to an active non-Markovian bath creates a `memory effect' where high-level semantic information (such as class identity or molecular metastability) is stored in the temporal correlations of auxiliary degrees of freedom. Using Fisher information analysis, we prove that this active mechanism significantly retards the rate of information decay compared to passive Brownian motion. Crucially, this memory effect facilitates an earlier and more robust symmetry breaking (speciation) during the reverse generative process, allowing the system to resolve multi-scale structures, reminiscent of metastable states in molecular configurations that are washed out in the typical noising processes. Our results suggest that non-equilibrium protocols, inspired by active matter physics, offer a thermodynamically distinct and potentially advantageous pathway for recovering high-dimensional energy landscapes using generative diffusion.</p>

            <p>We introduce a geometrical framework to construct a large class of time-dependent quantum systems, in which the position of a classical particle moving autonomously on a smooth connected manifold is used to steer a quantum Hamiltonian over time. This results in quantum drives with structured temporal profiles and properties dependent on the local and global nature of the underlying choice of manifold. We show that our construction recovers the well-known classes of periodically-driven and quasiperiodically-driven quantum systems, but also unveils fundamentally new classes of quantum dynamics: by utilizing a compact 2d hyperbolic Bolza surface and a nonorientable Klein-bottle surface, we demonstrate examples of a hyperbolically-driven quantum system and a nonorientably-driven quantum system respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these driven systems exhibit unusual quantized dynamical responses reflecting their different underlying topologies, under the condition of being fully gapped and in the adiabatic limit, and which have interpretations as quantized crystalline electromagnetic responses in certain exotic effective tight-binding lattice models. We envision geometric quantum driving as a general framework to chart the landscape of time-dependent quantum systems and investigate the universal phase structures they exhibit, as well as a useful tool to enhance the capabilities of modern day quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem, where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure, we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales (the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$) governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When $\tau_\mathrm{diff} \sim \tau_\mathrm{pv}$, we uncover a nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.</p>

            <p>We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET) between two separated parties $A$ and $B$, designed for transporting quantum energy across spacetime. The amount of energy gained through TQET is always greater than or equal to that obtained via natural time evolution for any spin chain where $A$ and $B$ are distinguishable. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When Bob acts immediately after receiving Alice's outcome, the protocol reduces to conventional QET. We present a proof-of-concept demonstration in the Ising model using quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3\% to around 40\%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across spacetime.</p>

            <p>Understanding different aspects of time is at the core of many areas in theoretical physics. Minimal models of continuous stochastic and quantum clocks have been proposed to explore fundamental limitations on the performance of timekeeping devices. Owing to the level of complexity in the clock structure and its energy consumption, such devices show trade-offs whose characterization remains an open challenge. Indeed, even conceptual designs for thermodynamically efficient quantum clocks are not yet well understood. In condensed matter theory, time-crystals were found as an exciting new phase of matter, featuring oscillations in (pseudo)-equilibrium with first experimental observations appearing recently. This naturally prompts the question: can time crystals be used as quantum clocks and what is their performance from a thermodynamic perspective? We answer this question and find that quantum time crystals are indeed genuine quantum clocks with a performance enhanced by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry.</p>

Adopting a hypergraph framework for a fine-scale trade-centric representation of international trade, we find that collapsed trades (hyperedges) are clustered and their occurrence decays algebraically with trade volume (weight), which suggests inhomogeneous, epidemic-like spreading of collapse in the international trade hypergraph. Modeling collapse propagation as a contagion process and analyzing its dynamics, we show that a positive degree-weight correlation and a volume-decaying collapse rate synergistically suppress the onset of global collective collapse. Notably, the degree-weight correlation persisted but the volume-decay of the collapse rate weakened during the 2008-2009 global economic recession, resulting in a broader collapse spread. Our study shows how the interplay between structure and dynamics stabilizes complex systems.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^†$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^†(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.</p>

            <p>Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5{+}1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.</p>

In this paper, we obtain the six-loop expressions not only for the leading-$n$ contribution but also for the subleading one. While the leading correction confirms the predictions of recent semiclassical calculation, the subleading one is a new result and will serve as a future welcome check for all-loop expressions. As an important by-product of our calculation, we provide a full dependence on $n$ of the four-loop $\gamma_{2n}$ in the $O(N)$ case.</p>

            <p>Understanding how microscopic few-body interactions give rise to thermal behavior in isolated quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. While individual energy eigenstates are expected to reproduce thermal equilibrium values, analytic access to highly entangled thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable Hamiltonians remains scarce. In this Letter, we construct exact infinite-temperature eigenstates of generically nonintegrable two-body Hamiltonians using stabilizer states. These states can fully reproduce thermal expectation values for all spatially local observables, extending previously known Bell-pair-based constructions to a broader class. At the same time, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy microscopic thermal equilibrium for all four-body observables. This bound is tight, as we explicitly construct a translationally invariant Hamiltonian whose stabilizer eigenstate is thermal for all two-body and three-body observables as well as all spatially local observables. Our results suggest that reproducing higher-order thermal correlations requires nonstabilizer degrees of freedom, providing analytic insight into the interplay between interaction locality, microscopic thermal equilibrium, and quantum computational complexity.</p>

            <h2>General-order degenerate coupled-cluster theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> So Hirata</p>
            <p>A size-extensive, converging, black-box, ab initio coupled-cluster ($\Delta$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-spin electrons, and any patterns of orbital occupancy. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference coupled-cluster ansatz. For a degenerate multireference, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate perturbation ($\Delta$MP) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, which may be useful for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A new, size-extensive, converging, general-model-space state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory is also proposed, to which $\Delta$CC theory is directly related. Determinant-based, general-order algorithms of $\Delta$CC and SUMRCC theories are implemented, which are compared with configuration-interaction (CI) and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theories through octuple excitations and with $\Delta$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm of $\Delta$CC theory is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitation ($\Delta$CCS) and of single and double excitations ($\Delta$CCSD). The order of performance is: SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $>$ EOM-CC $>$ CI at the same order or SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $>$ $\Delta$MP $>$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.</p>

            <h2>Detecting half-quantum superconducting vortices by spin-qubit relaxometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gábor B. Halász, Nirjhar Sarkar, Yueh-Chun Wu, Joshua T. Damron, Chengyun Hua, Benjamin Lawrie</p>
            <p>Half-quantum vortices in spin-triplet superconductors are predicted to harbor Majorana zero modes and may provide a viable avenue to topological quantum computation. Here, we introduce a novel approach for directly measuring the half-integer-quantized magnetic fluxes, $\Phi = h / (4e)$, carried by such half-quantum vortices via spin-qubit relaxometry. We consider a superconducting strip with a narrow pinch point at which vortices cross quasi-periodically below a spin qubit as a result of a bias current. We demonstrate that the relaxation rate of the spin qubit exhibits a pronounced peak if the vortex-crossing frequency matches the transition frequency of the spin qubit and conclude that the magnetic flux $\Phi$ of a single vortex can be obtained by dividing the corresponding voltage along the strip with the transition frequency. We discuss experimental constraints on implementing our proposed setup in spin-triplet candidate materials like UTe$_2$, UPt$_3$, and URhGe.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-geometry-enabled Landau-Zener tunneling in singular flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanyu Long, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>Flat-band materials have attracted substantial interest for their intriguing quantum geometric effects. Here we investigate how singular flat bands (SFBs) respond to a static, uniform electric field and whether they can support single-particle dc transport. By constructing a minimal two-band lattice model, we show that away from the singular band crossing point (BCP), the Wannier-Stark (WS) spectrum of the flat band is well captured by an intraband Berry phase $\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}$. The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport. In contrast, near the BCP the interband Berry connection becomes prominent and drives Landau-Zener tunneling, which bends the flat-band WS ladder and delocalizes the SFB wavefunctions. Remarkably, this regime is governed solely by the maximal quantum distance $d$ through two geometric phases $(\theta,\varphi)$: $\theta$ characterizes the tunneling rate and $\varphi$ acts as a generalized Berry phase. These results highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in enabling nontrivial transport signatures in SFBs.</p>

            <h2>Quantum capacitance and parity switching of a quantum-dot-based Kitaev chain</h2>

            <p>An array of quantum dots coupled via superconductivity provides a new platform for creating Kitaev chains with Majorana zero modes, offering a promising avenue toward topological quantum computing. In this work, we theoretically study the quantum capacitance of a minimal Kitaev chain weakly coupled to an external normal lead. We find that in the open regime, charge stability diagrams of quantum capcaitance can help to identify the sweet spot of a Kitaev chain, consistent with tunnel spectroscopy. Moreover, the quantum capacitance of a single quantum dot coupled to Andreev bound states reveals the interplay between two distinct parity switching mechanisms: coupling to an external normal lead and intrinsic quasiparticle poisoning. Our work provides useful physical insights into the quantum capacitance and parity dynamics in a quantum-dot-based Kitaev chain device.</p>

            <h2>Topological-transition-driven Giant Enhancement of Second-harmonic Generation in Ferroelectric Bismuth Monolayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Zheng Chen, Hongjun Xiang, Yusheng Hou</p>
            <p>The interplay between band topology and light in condensed materials could unlock intriguing nonlinear optical phenomena, enabling modern photonic technologies such as quantum light sources and sub-wavelength topological lasers. Here, we unveil that a buckling-tuned topological transition in ferroelectric bismuth monolayer unleashes a giant second-harmonic generation. Using first-principles calculations, we surprisingly find that ferroelectric bismuth monolayer with a buckling parameter, $\Delta h$, has a large susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ on the order of $10^{7}$ $\mathrm{pm}^2/\mathrm{V}$, exceeding monolayer MoS$_2$ by about two orders of magnitude. When $\Delta h$ is engineered to the critical window where Dirac electrons emerge, a low-frequency resonance appears, boosting $\chi^{(2)}$ by an additional order of magnitude. We show that this enhancement is localized on the Dirac cones and dominated by intraband modification contributions. Based on an extended Dirac model, we establish that this enhancement physically originates from the ultralight effective masses $m^{*}$ of Dirac electrons through scaling with the Fermi velocity $v_F$ and band gap $E_g$. Our findings provide a general paradigm for achieving exceptional second-harmonic generation via engineering topological criticality, and could serve as an experimental signature of Dirac electrons in topological materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erekle Jmukhadze, Sam Olin, Allan H. MacDonald, Wei-Cheng Lee</p>
            <p>The layer-dependent Hamiltonians of parallel-stacked MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayer moiré materials are topologically non-trivial, both in real space and in momentum space, and have been shown to support integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, as well as antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moiré band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $\theta=2.7^\circ$ and $\theta=3.65^\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Llanos, Veronica Show, Reiley Dorrian, Joseph Falson</p>
            <p>Magnetic field induced superconductivity is a rare property in nature due to the sensitivity of spin-singlet Cooper pairing to time-reversal symmetry breaking perturbations. However, in rare cases, an interplay between magnetic fields and ions can be engineered to bring about superconductivity at finite fields. Here we use ultra-thin LaSb$_2$ doped with dilute Ce paramagnetic impurities to demonstrate a magnetic field-induced superconducting dome in a two-dimensional crystal. The reduced dimensionality of the structure enables the use of an in-plane magnetic field to dynamically suppress spin fluctuations on the Ce-site, which leads to an anomalous enhancement of the critical temperature with increasing field. By modelling the spin scattering dynamics across the experimental parameter space, we reveal insight into the complex nature of paramagnetic impurities in magnetic fields at low temperature, and how their manipulation can result in the ability to tune between competing magnetic pair-breaking regimes. Realizing this physics in a two-dimensional crystalline setting invites the application of similar approaches to unconventional forms of superconductivity while also highlighting new experimental standards which should be employed when studying ultra-thin materials in general.</p>

Combining analytical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the superradiant region shrinks with increasing system size and disappears in the thermodynamic limit, while spectral collapse remains.

            <h2>Fractional Chern insulator with higher Chern number in optical lattice</h2>

            <p>Fractional Chern insulators arise in topologically nontrivial flat bands, characterized by an integer Chern number C that corresponds to the number of dissipationless edge states in the non-interacting regime. Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice. Our work provides a general and widely applicable strategy for constructing higher Chern number flat bands, opening a pathway to explore exotic fractional quantum phases.</p>

Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions.

We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. it remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light.

Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</p>

In this work, we elucidate the relationship between the finite-size corrections in the spin representation and the fermionic Casimir effect in the corresponding fermion representation. In particular, we focus on the ground-state energy of one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models, and show that all finite-size corrections can be interpreted as lattice fermionic Casimir effects. We further find several types of Casimir phenomena, such as the conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping behavior from massive fields, vanishing behavior from flat or nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from the finite-density effect. Our findings establish a dictionary between finite-size corrections in spin chains and fermionic Casimir effects, and provide experimentally relevant platforms for the fermionic Casimir phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Cooper Condensation and Pair Wave Functions in Strongly Correlated Electrons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannes Karlsson, Johannes S. Hofmann, Alexander Wietek</p>
            <p>Identifying superconducting states of matter without prior assumptions is a central challenge in strongly correlated electron systems. We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter.</p>

Crucially, in both protocols the cooling capability is limited by dissipatively induced diffusion processes. The resulting quadratic scaling of the cooling time with system size is corroborated also analytically using mean-field approximations and a purely classical random walk model. Furthermore, we find that the engineered protocol admits a unique and stable dark state, which contributes to an ongoing discussion regarding the applicability of dissipative state preparation to many-body systems.</p>

Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.</p>

            <p>The frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function (g(2)({\tau})) of single-molecule fluorescence has recently been proposed as a powerful new quantum light spectroscopy that can reveal intrinsic quantum coherence in excitation energy transfer in molecular systems ranging from simple dimers to photosynthetic complexes. Yet, no experiments have been reported to date. Here, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence g(2)({\tau}) quantum light spectroscopy (SMFg2-QLS) that can simultaneously measure the fluorescence intensity, lifetime, spectra, and g(2)({\tau}) with frequency resolution, for a single molecule in a controlled environment at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature. As a proof of principle, we have studied single molecules of IDTBT (indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole), a semiconducting donor-acceptor conjugated copolymer with a chain-like structure that shows a high carrier mobility and annihilation-limited long-range exciton transport. We have observed different g(2)({\tau}=0) values with different bands or bandwidths of the single molecule IDTBT fluorescence. The general features are consistent with theoretical predictions and suggest non-trivial excited state quantum dynamics, possibly showing quantum coherence, although further analysis and confirmation will require additional theoretical calculations that take into account the complexity and inhomogeneity of individual IDTBT single molecular chains. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of frequency- and time-resolved SMFg2-QLS to provide new insights into molecular quantum dynamics and to reveal signatures of intrinsic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light harvesting that are independent of the nature of the light excitation.</p>

            <p>Quantum geometry underlies many fundamental properties of materials, but it has remained largely inaccessible to direct experiment. Here we demonstrate that inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) provides a direct, quantitative probe of quantum geometry and quantum information in solids. Studying two prototype insulators, covalently bonded diamond and ionically bonded LiF, we measure the density response and experimentally determine the quantum Fisher information, the associated Bures metric, and the electron localization length. These measurements enable a quantitative comparison of quantum geometry for two distinct bonding environments. We find that the dimensionless quantum weight, $aK(q)$, which quantifies the longitudinal localization of quantum information, is constrained by fundamental electrostatic bounds in both materials. Crucially, the quantum weight of diamond exceeds that of LiF, indicating that covalent bonds exhibit a higher degree of delocalization and higher density of quantum information than the ionic bonds. Our results establish a direct experimental relationship between quantum information, electron localization, and chemical bonding, and identify IXS as a powerful tool for measuring quantum geometry in materials.</p>

The measurements reveal hybridization not only with bright resonant modes but also with optically dark modes and topological edge modes, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of the photocurrent spectroscopy. Moreover, the engineered near-field interactions allow the study of multi-mode ultrastrong coupling and the interplay between topological band structure and cavity quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity arises from the global phase coherence of Cooper pairs. The modulation of phase coherence leads to quantum phase transitions, serving as an important tool for the study of unconventional superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transitions in infinite-layer nickelate superconducting films by the control of spatially periodic network patterns. Magnetoresistance oscillations with a periodicity of h/2e provide direct evidence of 2e Cooper pairing in nickelates. The phase transitions are predominantly driven by enhanced superconducting fluctuations, with Cooper pairs involved in the charge transport across the transitions. Notably, we observe two types of anomalous metallic phases, emerging respectively in finite and down to zero magnetic fields. They can be characterized by bosonic excitations, suggesting the dynamic roles of vortices at the ground states. Our work establishes nickelates as a key platform for investigating the rich landscape of bosonic phases controlled via the phase coherence of Cooper pairs.</p>

            <p>We discuss a possibility of superconductivity in the p-wave magnets. These are recently discovered materials that have zero net magnetization by symmetry and finite non-relativistic spin splitting of electron bands, like in altermagnets. Similarly, the spin polarizations is collinear in the momentum space. Yet, as opposed to altermagnets, the magnetization is noncollinear in the real space, and the spin splitting obeys time-reversal symmetry in the momentum space. As a result, if such material harbors superconductivity (due to phonons, or any other mechanism), the only supported superconducting symmetry is Ising superconductivity, an exotic symmetry where any Cooper pair is a 50:50 mix of singlet and triplet. This unusual behavior is also in stark contrast to regular antiferromagnet, which can support Cooper pairs of any parity, and altermagnets, which can only support nonunitary triplet pairs. The presence of large triplet component and enhanced resilience against pair breaking is inherent to the p-wave magnets and as such is unconventional as it does not materialize in conventional spin-orbit coupling induced Ising superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eliya Blumenthal, Ilay Mangel, Amit Kanigel, Shay Hacohen-Gourgy</p>
            <p>Incorporating van der Waals (vdW) superconductors into Josephson elements extends circuit-QED beyond conventional Al/AlO$_x$/Al tunnel junctions and enables microwave probes of unconventional condensates and subgap excitations. In this work, we realize a flux-tunable transmon whose nonlinear inductive element is an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction. The tunnel barrier is formed by sequential deposition and full in-situ oxidation of ultrathin Al layers on an exfoliated 4Hb-TaS$_2$ flake, followed by deposition of a top Al electrode, yielding a robust, repeatable hybrid junction process compatible with standard transmon fabrication. Embedding the device in a three-dimensional copper cavity, we observe a SQUID-like flux-dependent spectrum that is quantitatively reproduced by a standard dressed transmon--cavity Hamiltonian, from which we extract parameters in the transmon regime. Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~\mu$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system. Although we do not resolve material-specific subgap modes in the present geometry, this work establishes a practical route to integrating 4Hb-TaS$_2$ into coherent quantum circuits and provides a baseline for future edge-sensitive designs aimed at enhancing coupling to boundary and subgap degrees of freedom in vdW superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Structure: Invariant Crystal Property Prediction with Pseudo-Particle Ray Diffraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Cao, Yang Liu, Longhan Zhang, Yifan Wu, Zhixun Li, Yuyu Luo, Hong Cheng, Yang Ren, Tong-Yi Zhang</p>
            <p>Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-range atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is openly available at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerardo Ortiz, Chinmay Giridhar, Philipp Vojta, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy, Zohar Nussinov</p>
            <p>We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</p>

            <h2>Detecting the full photoemission cone from laser-based ARPES experiments by leveraging deflector technology</h2>

            <p>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a direct access to the electronic band structure of solid and molecular systems. The momentum range accessible by this technique depends directly on the photon energy used, and low-photon-energy sources are insufficient to photoemit electrons over the full Brillouin zone of most quantum materials. In addition, while electrons are emitted over a 2$\pi$ solid angle, conventional hemispherical analyzers only collect a small subset of those electrons. A previous work [RSI 92, 123907 (2021)] demonstrated that electrons emitted over a larger field-of-view can be acquired in one fixed configuration by accelerating them towards the analyzer with a bias voltage. Here, we extend this work by leveraging the deflector technology of novel ARPES hemispherical analyzers. We demonstrate the ability to detect all $2\pi$ photoemitted electrons in a fixed configuration for various materials such as gold, cuprates and transition-metal dichalcogenides. This approach is especially advantageous for time-resolved ARPES, as electron dynamics over a large momentum range can be accessed with identical measurement conditions.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of Ferroelectric and Optical Properties in KNbO3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiden Ross, Venkatraman Gopalan, Long-Qing Chen</p>
            <p>Potassium niobate (KNbO3) is a prototypical perovskite ferroelectric with large electro-optic and nonlinear optical responses, high optical damage thresholds and a rich sequence of temperature-driven phase transformations, making it a promising platform for tunable photonic devices. In this work, we develop a thermodynamic model for the coupled ferroelectric and optical properties of KNbO3. By separating the total polarization into lattice and electronic contributions, the model provides a unified description of both the anisotropic ferroelectric and optical properties. The thermodynamic coefficients are determined by fitting to experimental measurements of the spontaneous polarization, dielectric susceptibilities, lattice parameters, and refractive indices. Without any further fitting, the model quantitatively predicts the temperature dependence of the electro-optic and piezoelectric coefficients in close agreement with experimental measurements. By utilizing the electronic polarization equation of motion, the model further captures the optical dispersion in the near infrared to visible spectrum. This work provides the thermodynamic foundation for future studies of coupled ferroelectric and optical phenomena in KNbO3.</p>

Physikalische Chemie, Berlin, Germany)</p>
            <p>There are conflicting predictions and reports on the character of the exciton Mott transition (EMT) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. It could be either a discontinuous or a continuous transition from the excitonic to the plasma phase, with important implications for devices such as photoswitches. To resolve the nature of the transition in monolayer WS$_2$, we study its ultrafast optical response upon resonant photoexcitation of the A exciton across a broad range of photoexcitation densities. In agreement with previously reported measurements we observe that the A exciton quenches gradually with increasing excitation density. However, a detailed lineshape analysis unveils an abrupt red shift in the transient peak positions of the A and B exciton resonances above an excitation density threshold. This is attributed to band gap renormalization arising from the formation of free charge carrier plasma, i.e., the EMT. The plasma phase decays with a time constant of 0.65 ps back into the excitonic state. The abrupt appearance of the plasma phase at the threshold density suggests that the EMT is a discontinuous and not a continuous transition. This work demonstrates how transient optical spectroscopy combined with lineshape analysis of two excitonic resonances simultaneously can be used to investigate the EMT in 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-protected topological polarons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaifa Luo, Jon Lafuente-Bartolome, Feliciano Giustino</p>
            <p>Emergent quasiparticles in solids often exhibit unique topological properties as a result of the complex interplay between charge, orbital, spin and lattice degrees of freedom. Among these quasiparticles, the polaron occupies a special place as the first known manifestation of the interaction between a fermion and a boson field. While polarons have been investigated for almost a century, whether these quasiparticles exhibit topological properties and why remain open questions. Here, we establish the universal symmetry principles governing the topology of polar textures in large polarons. Using a group-theoretic analysis, we identify four distinct classes of polar textures in time-reversal-invariant systems, and we show that they carry integer topological charges. We validate this classfication by performing state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of materials representative of each class. For these materials, we compute the fingerprints of polaron topology in Huang diffuse scattering, and propose ultrafast electron and X-ray scattering experiments to detect these quasiparticles.</p>

            <h2>Electric-field controlled nonlinear anomalous Nernst effect in two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Li Wu, Xiao-Qin Yu</p>
            <p>It's established that the nonlinear anomalous Nernst effect (NANE), originating from Berry curvature near the Fermi energy, is symmetry-permitted only when a single mirror symmetry exists in the transport plane of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we show that an applied direct electric field can lift this symmetry constraint, enabling an electric-field-induced NANE emerge in time-reversal symmetric 2D systems with higher crystallographic symmetries. This electric-field-induced NANE arises from both Berry connection polarization, rooted in the electric-field-corrected Berry curvature, and the anomalous-velocity-modified nonequilibrium Fermi distribution function. Additionally, we propose an alternating temperature gradient as a driving force instead of the conventional steady one, ensuring experimental detection of NANE via second-harmonic measurement techniques. The behaviour of electric-field-induced NANE in the monolayer graphene has been theoretically and systematically investigated.</p>

            <h2>Catalog of phonon emergent particles and chiral phonons: Symmetry-based classification and materials database investigation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Houhao Wang, Dongze Fan, Hoi Chun Po, Xiangang Wan, Feng Tang</p>
            <p>Chirality and topology are fundamental and ubiquitous in nature. Symmetry has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting topological phonons. However, to date, topological phonon emergent particles (EMPs) have not been systematically cataloged in material databases. Moreover, traditional symmetry methods are often inadequate for predicting chiral phonons, because realistic calculations can yield negative results even when symmetry analysis permits phonon chirality. Here, we first establish a complete symmetry-based classification: given any space group and Wyckoff positions (WYPOs) occupied by atoms, the number of occurrences of all (co-)irreducible representations ((co-)irreps) (that can host EMPs) can be unambiguously known without omission prior to expensive and parameter-dependent calculation. Moreover, whether a phonon mode (belonging to one (co-)irrep) is chiral can also be determined from the occupied WYPOs. We then perform a materials database investigation identifying over 25 million EMPs at high-symmetry points and along high-symmetry lines and computing the concrete value of phonon angular momentum for each mode. We demonstrate two main applications: identifying ideal materials with surface chirality momentum locking and identifying materials with giant phonon magnetic moment. All computational data are compiled into a website: this http URL, which is expected to stimulate future studies on topological and chiral phonons.</p>

            <h2>Tunable two-dimensional Dirac-Weyl semimetal phase induced by altermagnetism</h2>

            <p>We demonstrate a tunable Dirac-Weyl semimetal phase in two dimensions, realized by introducing in-plane d-wave altermagnetism into a Dirac system. This phase hosts both a central Dirac point and momentumseparated Weyl points connected by Fermi line edge states. The Weyl point positions--and thus the edge-state connectivity--can be continuously tuned by rotating the altermagnetic axis. In contrast, out-of-plane altermagnetism gaps part of the bulk spectrum while preserving a single Dirac point accompanied by chiral edge modes, as evidenced by quantized edge polarization. Our findings provide a tunable platform for manipulating Dirac-Weyl physics and topological edge transport in two dimensions.</p>

            <p>We report a comprehensive investigation of the physical properties of the Dirac semimetal compound EuAuBi single crystals, using neutron diffraction, magnetization, electrical transport, and specific heat measurements. EuAuBi crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with space group P63mc (No. 186). First-principles calculations using density functional theory characterize it as a Dirac semimetal, with a notable band-crossing in proximity to the Fermi level (EF ) along the {\Gamma}-A direction. The crystal exhibits three distinct magnetic phases at 4 K (TN1), 3.5 K (TN2), and 2.8 K (TN3)as observed from magnetic and specific heat measurements. However, zero-field neutron diffraction resolves only two magnetic phases: a commensurate antiferromagnetic phase and a canted antiferromagnetic phase. Field-dependent ac and dc magnetization measurements uncover field-induced non-trivial spin textures in the magnetic field range 1.5 to 3 T, manifested as a tilted plateau in the magnetization curves. The interplay between conduction carriers and these spin textures is further evidenced by unique features in the magnetic field-dependent longitudinal resistivity in the system. Finally, we present a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram of EuAuBi, highlighting diverse spin alignments present in the material. EuAuBi thus emerges as a rare material system in which both momentum-space and real-space Berry curvature effects may coexist, providing a unique opportunity to investigate their interplay.</p>

            <p>Magnetic-field-driven Lifshitz transitions are typically considered zero-temperature phenomena involving Fermi-surface reconstruction without symmetry breaking. Here, we report an unconventional Lifshitz transition in TaCo2Te2 that emerges exclusively within a narrow finite-temperature window under cooperative tuning by both temperature and magnetic field. Bulk-sensitive transport and thermoelectric measurements demonstrate continuous Fermi-surface renormalization at low temperatures, where the transition is sharply triggered by a critical magnetic field. Crucially, neutron diffraction reveals the absence of structural or magnetic phase transitions, while angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy shows no spectral anomalies in electronic structure without magnetic field. These observations constrain the mechanism to a Zeeman-driven process invisible to equilibrium probes, establishing a paradigm where Fermi-surface topology is jointly controlled by temperature and magnetic field.</p>

            <p>We used density functional theories (DFT) to investigate the properties of Au2O and Au2O3-x (x = 00.08) to reveal their remarkable functionalities. Hybrid functional theories accurately estimate the band gap (Eg) of oxides, and the present hybrid functional calculations determined Eg values of 0.96 eV for Au2O and 2.86 eV for Au2O3, which is >300% of the commonly accepted Eg of Au2O3 (0.85 eV). Moreover, we discovered spontaneous polarization (PS) in Au2O3, which is unusually large and advantageous for catalysis. The PS was retained even in 2-nm-thick Au2O3 nanosheets, similar to hyperferroelectric, generating a potential of 0.6 eV despite screening caused by surface reconstruction, which is a novel screening mechanism. Below a thickness of 0.8 nm, the PS vanished, and inversion symmetry emerged at 0.4 nm, suggesting a new approach to finding a paraelectric phase. Au2O was supersoft under shear distortion.</p>

            <p>Kagome materials are at the frontier of condensed matter physics. An ideal kagome lattice features only one geometrically frustrated flat band spanning the entire momentum space and a single Dirac cone at the Brillouin-zone corners. However, for the first time, here we observe unusual flat-band and Dirac physics in the newly discovered "322" kagome material Ni3In2S2 by combining high-resolution synchrotron- and laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, scanning tunneling microscopy, and first-principles calculations. We resolve two distinct electronic flat-band states located in close proximity to the Fermi level: a robust Topological Surface Flat Band at ~40 meV below the Fermi level on the Sulfur-terminated surface, originating from weak topological insulator states, and a kagome lattice-derived flat band at ~100 meV binding energy with an ultranarrow bandwidth (~5 meV). Instead of the single Dirac cone, the Indium-terminated surface hosts a rare two-dimensional Dirac-node arc state, where the gapless Dirac nodes extend along an open one-dimensional line crossing the Brillouin-zone boundary, exhibiting sharp linear dispersion, exceptionally high Fermi velocity, and pronounced circular dichroism. These findings establish Ni3In2S2 as a unique topological kagome metal in which multiple flat-band states of different physical origin coexist with an unusual Dirac-node arc, opening an avenue for discovering flat-band--driven and topology-enabled quantum phenomena.</p>

            <p>Extending hyperuniformity from classical to quantum fluctuations in electron systems yields a framework that identifies quantum phase transitions and reveals underlying gap structures through the quantum weight. We study long-wavelength fluctuations of many-body ground states through the charge-density structure factor by incorporating intrinsic quantum fluctuations into hyperuniformity. Although charge fluctuations at zero temperature are generally suppressed by particle-number conservation, their long-wavelength scaling reveals distinct universal behaviors that define quantum hyperuniformity classes. By exemplifying the Aubry-Andre model, we find that gapped, gapless, and localized-critical-extended phases are sharply distinguished by the quantum hyperuniformity classes. Notably, at the critical point, multifractal wave functions generate anomalous scaling behavior. We further show that, in quantum-hyperuniform gapped phases, the quantum weight provides a quantitative measure of the gap size through a universal power-law scaling. Along with classical hyperuniformity, quantum hyperuniformity serves a direct fingerprint of quantum criticality and a practical probe of quantum phase transitions in aperiodic electron systems.</p>

In this study, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition was transferred from copper onto the top of the standard AlGaN/GaN wafer, forming a heterostructure with two conducting layers separated by an AlGaN barrier layer. Contacts fabricated to the two-dimensional electron gas and graphene allowed us to study the drag current induced in graphene by passing the drive current through the two-dimensional electron gas. At low temperatures, the graphene drag current exhibited quantum oscillations as a function of the drive voltage. As temperature increases, quantum oscillations disappear, and the magnitude of the drag current increases. Graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are a promising platform for studying drag and two-stream instability effects, especially if the AlGaN barrier layer thickness can be reduced to a few nanometers.</p>

            <p>Continuous measurement of quantum systems provides a standard route to quantum trajectories through the successive acquisition of information which further results in measurement back-action. In this work, we harness this back-action as a resource for global $U(1)$ symmetry restoration where continuous measurement is combined with a $U(1)$-preserving unitary evolution. Starting from a $U(1)$ symmetry-broken initial state, we simulate quantum trajectories generated by continuous measurements of both global and local observables. We show that under global monitoring, states containing superpositions of distant charge sectors restore symmetry faster than those involving nearby sectors. We establish the universality of this behavior across different measurement protocols. Finally, we demonstrate that local monitoring can further accelerate symmetry restoration for certain states that relax slowly under global monitoring.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seung-Ju Hong, Tae Yun Kim, Cheol-Hwan Park</p>
            <p>$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a candidate Kitaev material that exhibits zigzag antiferromagnetic ordering below 7 K. One contentious issue regarding this material is its bulk structure in the low-temperature phase. Recently, it has become generally accepted from experiments that the low- and high-temperature structures belong to the $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ space groups, respectively. However, there was no theoretical study supporting the $R\bar{3}$-type structure as the low-temperature structure. In this study, we use constrained density functional theory to show that the $R\bar{3}$ structure is lower in energy than the $C2/m$ structure, in agreement with experimental observations. Then, we show that the conduction band minimum states are almost of the $J_\textrm{eff}=1/2$ and $m_\textrm{eff}=-1/2$ character, if we set the angular momentum quantization axis to be parallel to the Néel vector; this is the first analysis of the $J_\textrm{eff}$ picture for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ from this perspective. In addition, we compute the anisotropic magnetic exchange parameters and $g$ factors of monolayer $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of its magnetism. Our results demonstrate that both second-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions and magnetic moments not captured by the conventional atomic orbital projection method are necessary for accurate description of the magnetism in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Moreover, the calculated $g$ factors are in fairly good agreement with experimental measurements, especially the small anisotropy between their in-plane and out-of-plane components. Finally, we examine the effects of structural distortions from a perfect RuCl$_6$ octahedron, already present in bulk $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ without any external perturbation, on the magnetic properties.

The density of states peaks near the Fermi level, with the low energy region largely unaffected. Graphene's low energy helical wave functions yield topological features like pseudospin momentum locking and a pi Berry phase, leading to distinct transport behavior.

            <p>The interplay among electronic correlation, topology, and time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) often leads to exotic quantum states of matter. Primary examples include the recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2) and multilayer graphene aligned with hBN, where TRS is broken in partially filled flat moire Chern bands. Among the FCIs in tMoTe2, the most robust is at a hole filling of v = -2/3 per moire unit cell. Interestingly, transient optical sensing and more recent transport measurements revealed a correlated state at v = -4/3, twice the filling factor for the v = -2/3 FCI. Here, employing pump-probe circular dichroism (CD) measurements on tMoTe2 with twist angles = 3.9 degree and 3.7 degree, we find that the v = -4/3 state exhibits vanishing magnetization (m = 0) in finite windows of out-of-plane magnetic field less than ~2-4 mT, and a first order phase transition to + - m states at higher fields. This out-of-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM) like behavior is notably absent for all other correlated states and disappears for the v = -4/3 state at higher or lower twist angles = 4.0 degree and 3.3 degree. The observed magnetic signature at v = -4/3 is consistent with a predicted fractional topological insulator (FTI) with TRS, consisting of two copies of -2/3 FCIs with opposite chiralities. We support these findings with calculations in the interacting continuum model of tMoTe2. Our work presents a candidate for fractional topological insulators with TRS.</p>

            <h2>Exotic vortex states at high magnetic fields in a quasi-two-dimensional FeSe-based superconductor</h2>

            <p>Owing to strong electronic correlations, high-temperature superconductivity always exhibits intricate intertwinement with various competing electronic orders in phase diagrams, such as spin/charge density waves (S/CDWs). In cuprate superconductors,the intertwinement of superconductivity and CDW order could strongly affect the fundamental properties of superconductivity, such as the critical temperature(Tc) and critical magnetic field(Hc). Recent high-field transport measurements indicate that when quantum fluctuations become important at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, the CDW order also reshapes the vortex states, which leads to fragile superconductivity with extremely low critical current(Jc). Here, by performing comprehensive high-field transport measurements, the H-T phase diagram of vortex states is mapped to H = 33 T in a quasi-two-dimensional FeSe-based superconductor (TBA+)xFeSe with a zero-resistivity transition temperature above 40 K. Our results indicate that (TBA+)xFeSe is an extremely type II superconductor with significant thermal this http URL low temperatures, high magnetic fields cause the vortex solid state to exhibit similar current-dependent zero-resistance behavior as the fragile superconductivity in cuprate superconductors with CDW order. When the vortex solid state is melted with increasing temperature, a superconducting regime with vortex-like phase fluctuations emerges as an intermediate state, which features finite longitudinal resistance and vanishing Hall resistance. At higher temperatures, a vortex liquid state with finite Hall resistance eventually appears due to thermal fluctuations. All these observations suggest exotic vortex states beyond the classical paradigm of vortex matter.</p>

            <h2>Formation Dynamics of Quantum Droplets for Homonuclear and Heteronuclear Mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrique Calderoli, Gerardo Martinez</p>
            <p>Great effort has been invested over the past decade in studying the properties of quantum droplets, a phase of bosonic quantum matter that arises as a consequence of the fluctuating Lee-Huang-Yang correction. However, the dynamics of droplet formation for heteronuclear Bose mixtures is partially understood. Here, we numerically analyze the formation process for homonuclear and heteronuclear boson mixtures in one dimension using a tight-binding model and real-time evolution. A systematic sweep of interaction strengths, mass ratios, and initial conditions allows us to characterize quantitative criteria for droplet formation and equilibration. We find that the energy contribution of the LHY correction dominates the energetic profile of the droplets formed, with the deepest binding occurring for mass ratios $m_2/m_1 \in [1.2,2.0]$. Breathing oscillations are observed, and the low equilibration rate is consistent with the restricted nature of the phase space for one-dimensional systems; the oscillation frequency is found to have a very weak correlation to the interaction strengths. For the simulation, Gaussian over discrete initial conditions are clearly favorable to the formation of droplets. The results contained herein provide rich insight into the dynamical nature of quantum droplet physics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the collective excitation spectrum and dynamics of a quasi two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba type spin-orbit (SO) coupling. Employing Bogoliubov-de-Gennes analysis, we analytically compute the excitation spectra across a wide range of interaction strengths and coupling parameters. By systematically varying the SO and Rabi couplings, we uncover distinct dynamical signatures of quantum phase transitions, including mode softening, the appearance of roton-like minima, and miscibility-driven instabilities in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interaction regimes. In the antiferromagnetic case, these instabilities lead to a dynamically unstable supersolid phase characterized by the coexistence of density modulation and global phase coherence. To corroborate the analytical predictions, we numerically solve the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations and analyze the dynamical stability of the condensate. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for spinor condensates with tunable spin-orbit coupling and demonstrate the rich interplay between spin-dependent interactions and synthetic couplings in nonequilibrium quantum fluids.</p>

            <h2>Boundary condition for phonon distribution functions at a smooth crystal interface and interfacial angular momentum transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Suzuki, Shuntaro Sumita, Yusuke Kato</p>
            <p>We theoretically elucidate the boundary conditions for phonon distribution functions of long-wavelength acoustic phonons at smooth crystal interfaces. We first derive boundary conditions that fully incorporate reflection, transmission, and mode conversion. We obtain these conditions for phonons from those for classical lattice vibrations, using the correspondence between the quantum and classical descriptions. This formulation provides a theoretical foundation for the acoustic mismatch model, widely used to analyze Kapitza resistance. We then refine the boundary conditions to include spatial dependence parallel to the interface. The refined form captures transverse shifts of elastic wave packets, analogous to the optical Imbert--Fedorov shift, and ensures conservation of total angular momentum. Consequently, circularly polarized phonons carrying spin angular momentum (SAM) generate phonon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at the interface. We analytically determine the spatial profile of this OAM and demonstrate that SAM and OAM are both involved in the interfacial diffusion of chiral phonons. Our theory provides concise boundary conditions for phonons, with applications ranging from heat transport to phonon angular momentum transport.</p>

            <p>Aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as normal alkanes, constitute a naturally abundant source of carbon atoms. Of special interest is the formation of cyclic and aromatic products from aliphatic reactants. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy and ab initio calculations, we investigate the thermal induced aromatization of linear n octane molecules on the catalytic Pt(111) surface and the reactions of intermolecular homocoupling between them at temperatures above 600 K. The cycloaromatization of individual n octane molecules requires bending the linear adsorbates prior to their dehydrogenation and the formation of an intramolecular C-C bond, yielding adsorbed benzene rings. In addition, the Pt(111) surface catalyzes a homocoupling reaction by initiating the formation of a C-C bond between the dehydrogenated methyl ends of the chemisorbed n octane molecules and then propagating along the carbon backbone in a zipper like fashion. Our findings provide molecular level insight into the heterogeneous catalytic processes underlying the generation of aromatic products and stable on surface polycyclic species.</p>

            <h2>Role of transfer films and interfacial cracking in metallic sliding wear</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R.Xu, B.N.J. Persson</p>
            <p>The origin of wear particles in metallic sliding contacts remains debated. Classical views based on cold-welded junctions suggest that plastic yielding of the real contact area should lead to large wear coefficients, in apparent contradiction with the small values typically measured for metals. Here we argue that this discrepancy can be resolved if most junctions do not directly produce wear particles, but instead cause metal transfer and the formation of a weakly bound transfer film. Wear then occurs intermittently when fragments of this film detach due to crack propagation at the interface between the transfer film and the underlying bulk metal. We perform unlubricated reciprocating sliding experiments on nominally smooth stainless steel, brass, and aluminum. For steel on steel, the wear mass loss shows an initial stage with negligible mass change up to a sliding distance of $\sim 2.4 \ {\rm m}$, followed by a linear regime. Transfer-film formation in dissimilar-metal contacts is evidenced by optical imaging, net mass gain of the steel slider, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and the collected debris is flake-like. These observations support a transfer-film-controlled wear mechanism associated with cold-welded junctions.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the objective of quantifying the energetic cost of accessing boundary phases through local control, we investigate here a simple, analytically tractable quantum impurity model. This model exhibits a rich boundary phase diagram, characterized by phases with different numbers of edge states. By considering a local quench protocol that drives the system out of equilibrium, we calculate exactly the resulting quantum work distribution across these phases. Our results show that the presence of edge states strongly alters this distribution. In particular, we analytically determine key fingerprints of these states both near the low-energy threshold and in the high-energy region.</p>

            <p>Superconducting systems may display different types of nonequilibrium states depending on the specific constraints imposed for measurement. We probe current-voltage relations of three-dimensional superconducting films by allowing finite voltages to develop across their length. Our experiments reveal sharp features of negative differential conductance which highlight the validity of the principle of minimum entropy production at the critical current transition. We have observed dissipative states with resistances intermediate between those of superconducting and normal phases at zero applied magnetic field, indicating a phenomenon of phase coexistence under nonequilibrium conditions.

            <h2>Multi-target density matrix renormalization group for 3D CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Xiang Hao, Zheng Zhu, Yang Qi</p>
            <p>The fuzzy sphere regularization provides a powerful framework for studying three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs) by mapping them onto numerically tractable lattice models on the spherical lowest Landau level. However, the system sizes accessible to this method have been limited by the exact diagonalization (ED). In this work, we transcend this limitation by combining the fuzzy sphere regularization with a sophisticated multi-target density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. Focusing on the 3D Ising-type model on the spherical lowest Landau level, we calculate the 24 low-lying energies at a larger system size than previously feasible with ED. At criticality, we extract the scaling dimensions of six primary operators, and the results show significantly improved agreement with bootstrap benchmarks compared to previous ED results at smaller sizes. Our approach allows us to efficiently target multiple excited states in larger systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. This study establishes the fuzzy sphere regularization combined with advanced DMRG techniques as a powerful and general framework for precision physics in 3D CFTs.</p>

            <h2>Giant Resonant Enhancement of Photoinduced Dynamical Cooper Pairing, far above $T_c$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, Marios Michael, Andrea Cavalleri, Eugene Demler</p>
            <p>Pump-probe experiments performed on $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ have unveiled both optical and transport signatures of metastable light-induced superconductivity up to room temperature, far above $T_c$. Recent experiments have uncovered that excitation in the vicinity of $50 ~\textrm{meV}$ enables the observation of high temperature light-induced superconductivity at significantly lower fluences. Inspired by these experiments we develop a mechanism which can explain such a giant resonant enhancement of light-induced superconductivity. Within a minimal non-linear Holstein model, we show that resonantly driving optical Raman modes leads to a time-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Such a coupling then modulates the effective electron-electron attraction, with the strongest modulations occurring when the drive is resonant with the phonon frequency. These dynamical modulations of the pairing interactions lead to Floquet-BCS instabilities at temperatures far exceeding equilibrium $T_c$, as observed in experiments. We conclude by discussing the implications of our general analysis on the $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ experiments specifically and suggesting experimental signatures of our mechanism.</p>

            <p>One-dimensional kagome strip chains share much of the same frustrated structural motif as two-dimensional kagome antiferromagnets, making them valuable for deepening our understanding of kagome lattice magnetism. In this paper, we report the hydrothermal synthesis and detailed structural and property characterization of Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, a striped kagome system. The crystal structure was characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals that Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system C2/m. The structure features a one-dimensional kagome strip lattice built from Co2+ ions and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 14 K. The magnetic ground state at zero field was characterized using neutron powder diffraction. Below the magnetic transition, Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 orders into an antiferromagnetic structure with a k-vector (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In the proposed model, the Co1 moment is predominantly confined to the ac-plane while the Co2 moment is primarily aligned along the b-axis. Two flat bands were observed in the inelastic neutron spectra below the magnetic transition at 5 and 10 meV. Inelastic neutron spectra were modeled with a Heisenberg Hamiltonian including three nearest-neighbor exchange interactions (J1, J2, J3) and strong single-ion anisotropy to stabilize the observed magnetic structure. Our study highlights the complexity of the Co2+-based kagome strip magnetic lattice compound Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, which provides an excellent platform to broaden our understanding of the frustrated kagome magnetic lattice space.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmions are topological quasiparticles potentially useful for memory and computing devices. Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions present no transverse deflection, making them suitable candidates for data storage applications. After the discovery of skyrmions with length scales comparable to the lattice constant, several works presented quantum analogues of classical ferromagnetic skyrmions in spin systems. However, studies about quantum analogues of AF skyrmions are still lacking. Here, we explore the phases of the AF quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions on the triangular lattice using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. We study the magnetization profile, spin structure factor and quantum entanglement of the resulting ground states to characterize the corresponding phases and signal the emergence of quantum AF skyrmions. Our results support that three-sublattice quantum antiferromagnetic skyrmion textures are stabilized in a wide range of magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>We develop a simple and general variational method to estimate the solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations and obtain the corresponding density profiles for all spin states of a trapped spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. We further employ this approach to obtain the complete phase diagram of the system under quasi-one-dimensional harmonic confinement, with ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic spin interactions. We identify a suitable scaling that collapses all phase diagrams for different system sizes (i.e., total particle number) into a universal (system size-independent) phase diagram. The complete phase diagram for a confined system shows some significant qualitative differences compared to that of a condensate with homogeneous density distribution. The phase diagrams reported here could help identify the important parameter regimes in which phase transitions in the confined system, in general, occur. This knowledge of the region of phase boundaries can enable a reliable investigation of the instabilities near the boundaries that drive phase transitions.</p>

            <p>This work presents a study on the application of Time-Resolved Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TR-APXPS) in association with chemometric techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS), to investigate the surface chemistry and dynamics of Fe2O3 reduction processes. The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> So Hirata</p>
            <p>A size-extensive, converging, black-box coupled-cluster ($\Delta$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-spin electrons, any patterns of orbital occupancy, any spin multiplicities, and any spatial symmetries. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference, projection coupled-cluster ansatz. For degenerate references, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate RS perturbation ($\Delta$MP) theory, and is closely related to, but distinct from Li and Paldus's state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection (nonvariational) Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, whose practical utility seems rather limited except for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A determinant-based, general-order algorithm is implemented, generating $\Delta$CC energies through connected octuple excitations, which are compared with the results from CI, equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC), and SUMRCC theories up to the FCI limits as well as from $\Delta$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitations only and of single and double excitations. The order of performance is: $\Delta$CC $>$ EOM-CC $>$ CI at the same order or $\Delta$CC $>$ $\Delta$MP $>$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.</p>

Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Decoherence Times in Finite-Memory Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramandeep Dewan</p>
            <p>Decoherence is often modeled using Markovian master equations that predict exponential suppression of coherence and are frequently used as effective bounds on quantum behavior in complex environments. Such descriptions, however, correspond to the singular physical limit of vanishing environmental memory. Here we formulate decoherence using a general time-nonlocal decoherence functional determined solely by the environmental force correlation function, with Markovian dynamics recovered explicitly as a limiting case. For arbitrary stationary environments with finite temporal correlations, we show that the decoherence functional exhibits quadratic short-time growth that is model-independent within the finite-memory class considered. Consequently, the decoherence time defined operationally-without assuming exponential decay-scales as the square root of the environmental correlation time, independent of the detailed form of the bath correlation kernel. These results are illustrated analytically for Gaussian-correlated, soft power-law, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environments. In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck case, the non-Markovian dynamics admit an exact analytical closure, yielding a closed evolution equation for the coherence. Exact numerical simulations based on a pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling and show that exponential decoherence emerges only in the memoryless limit. Beyond coherence decay, we distinguish decoherence rates from observable loss of quantum signatures by analyzing purity and von Neumann entropy dynamics. We show that suppression of a specific coherence element need not coincide with irreversible entropy production. Finally, we introduce an inferred-memory perspective in which the environmental correlation time is treated as an operationally extractable parameter from dynamical data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ravi Venkata Surya Sai Mogilisetti, Partha Pratim Das, Rassel Raihan, Shiyao Lin</p>
            <p>Digital image correlation (DIC) has become one of the most popular methods for deformation characterization in experimental mechanics. DIC is based on optical images taken during experimentation and post-test image processing. Its advantages include the capability to capture full-field deformation in a non-contact manner, the robustness in characterizing excessive deformation induced by events such as yielding and cracking, and the versatility to integrate optical cameras with a variety of open-source and commercial codes. In this paper, we developed a new paradigm of DIC analysis by integrating camera control into the DIC process flow. The essential idea is to dynamically increase the camera imaging frame rate with excessive deformation or deformation rate, while maintaining a relatively low imaging frame rate with small and slow deformation. We refer to this new DIC paradigm as in-situ on-demand (ISOD) DIC. ISOD DIC enables real-time deformation analysis, visualization, and closed-loop camera control. ISOD DIC has captured approximately 178% more images than conventional DIC for samples undergoing crack growth due to its dynamically adjusted frame rate, with the potential to significantly enhance data richness for damage inspection without consuming excessive storage space and analysis time, thereby benefiting the characterization of intrinsic constitutive behaviors and damage mechanisms</p>

            <p>Coherent perfect absorption (CPA)-the time-reversed operation of lasing at threshold-relies on finely tuned interference and is intrinsically fragile to disorder and structural imperfections. Whether absorption can be endowed with topological protection, by analogy to topological lasing, has remained an open question. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a topological antilaser: the time-reversed counterpart of a topological laser, in which chiral edge modes of a photonic lattice enable perfect light absorption protected by topology. Using a nonreciprocal microwave network with low intrinsic loss, we show that the topological antilaser preserves near-unity absorption under strong disorder, and, unlike conventional antilasers, remains functional for arbitrary placements of dissipation and input ports, even when the lattice is strongly perturbed. This robustness arises from the disorder-immune propagation and stable spatial profile of the topological edge modes. Our results establish topologically protected absorption as the missing counterpart of topological lasing, opening new directions for studying robust energy dissipation, wave control, and coherent-absorption-based detection technologies.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling hidden features of social evolution by inferring Langevin dynamics from data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youngkyoung Bae, Hajime Shimao, Seungwoong Ha, Luna Yang, David Wolpert</p>
            <p>Are there hidden dynamical common patterns in the evolution of social and cultural history? While the growing availability of digitized social data invites us to answer this question, prevailing quantitative methods often rely on deterministic snapshots or average effects. Such approaches overlook the continuous and inherently uncertain nature of historical trajectories. In this paper, we propose a framework for modeling historical dynamics as stochastic processes described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By viewing historical change through the lens of continuous-time dynamics, this framework provides a natural language to describe how structural trends and inherent random fluctuations interact to shape societal evolution. This approach allows us to handle the uncertainty in fragmentary historical records, moving beyond the dichotomy of structural determinism versus pure chance. We demonstrate that adopting this stochastic perspective unlocks a rich suite of analytical capabilities unavailable to static models. Specifically, we introduce methods to: (1) quantify the irreversibility; (2) detect exogenous perturbations; (3) perform multiple imputation for missing historical records. This framework offers a unified methodology for dissecting the stability, contingency, and dynamics of historical change.</p>

            <p>We report on the first experimental realization of multi-material dielectric mirror coatings designed through a multi-objective optimization algorithm to simultaneously minimize thermal noise and optical losses. We validate this design strategy by fabricating and characterizing two distinct ternary systems: a SiNx -based proof-of-concept and a Ti:GeO2 -based system targeting lower optical losses. The performance of the SiN x coating shows remarkable agreement with predictions, demonstrating a noise amplitude spectral density reduction of 0.82 with respect to current reference coatings, and validating our design-to-fabrication pipeline. The Ti:GeO2 -based system achieves the crucial goal of sub-ppm absorption; its measured thermal noise, however, is higher than the theoretically predicted level of 0.71, extrapolated from single-layer material characterization. A dedicated tolerance analysis confirms that this discrepancy is not attributable to random thickness errors, emphasizing that further studies of the manufacturing process are needed to fully exploit this combination of materials. This work establishes a robust methodology for producing complex, high-performance optical coatings tailored for precision experiments.</p>

Some of them - like the T centre - also possess optically-active spins that enable spin-photon interfaces for generating entangled photons and multi-spin registers. This paper explores the generation of several types of colour centres in silicon for mass-manufacturable silicon-on-insulator quantum devices. We investigate how different processes in the device development affect the presence of the quantum emitters, including thermal annealing and fabrication steps for optical nanostructures. The study reveals coupled formation dynamics between different colour centres, identifies optimal parameters for annealing processes, and reports on the sensitivity to annealing duration and nanofabrication procedures for photonic integrated circuits. Furthermore, we discern stable optical signals from colour centres in silicon which have not been identified before.</p>

            <p>Dielectric materials are critical building blocks for modern electronics such as sensors, actuators, and transistors. With the rapid recent advance in soft and stretchable electronics for emerging human- and robot-interfacing applications, there is a surging need for high-performance dielectric elastomers. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop soft elastomers that simultaneously possess high dielectric constants (k, related to energy storage capacity) and low Young's moduli (E, related to mechanical flexibility). While some new elastomer designs have been reported in individual (mostly one-off) studies, almost no structured dataset is currently available for dielectric elastomers that systematically encompasses their molecular sequence, dielectric, and mechanical properties. Within this context, we curate a compact, high-quality dataset of acrylate-based dielectric elastomers, one of the most widely explored elastomer backbones due to its versatile chemistry and molecular design flexibility, by screening and aggregating experimental results from the literature over the past 10 years. Building on this dataset, we propose a multimodal learning framework that leverages large-scale pretrained polymer representations from graph- and sequence-based encoders. These pretrained embeddings transfer rich chemical and structural knowledge from vast polymer corpora, enabling accurate few-shot prediction of both dielectric and mechanical properties from molecular sequences. Our results represent a new paradigm for transferring knowledge from pretrained multimodal models to overcome severe data scarcity, which can be readily translated to other polymer backbones (e.g., silicones, urethanes) and thus accelerate data-efficient discovery of soft high-k dielectric elastomers.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeki Hayran, John B. Pendry, Prasad P. Iyer, Francesco Monticone</p>
            <p>Time-varying photonic systems open new possibilities for controlling light, enabling photonic time crystals, time reflection and refraction, frequency conversion, synthetic gauge fields, optical nonreciprocity, among others. These effects emerge from the dynamic modulation of optical properties, which can mediate photonic transitions between eigenstates of different frequencies and/or wavevectors. To achieve such transitions, conventional approaches rely on periodic modulation schemes that demand ultrafast modulation rates and continuous energy input, posing significant practical challenges at optical frequencies. Here, we demonstrate that periodic-modulation-driven photonic transitions within the radiation continuum can be effectively mimicked using a single-period ultrafast pulse modulation, eliminating the need for sustained continuous modulation. By leveraging dispersion engineering in metasurfaces to tailor the density of states in the radiation continuum, we achieve controlled frequency transitions and theoretically demonstrate strong nonreciprocity for free-space waves as a key application. Our findings may guide future experimental research on time-varying photonics using materials such as transparent conductive oxides and semiconductors, expanding the possibilities for ultrafast and reconfigurable optical technologies. More broadly, our work may establish a practical and energy-efficient framework for dynamic photonic systems, with potential applications ranging from spatio-temporal wavefront manipulation to photonic computing and ultrafast signal processing.</p>

            <h2>In-depth analysis of bar formation mechanisms of disk galaxies in halos of different concentrations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Worrakitpoonpon</p>
            <p>We use $N$-body simulations to investigate the distinct bar formation processes in disks residing in halos of various concentrations. In a highly concentrated halo, the bar development is limited by the dominant multi-arm modes as a result of the swing amplification in the early stage. Only after the multi-arm modes decay, the bar growth proceeds mechanically owing to the particle trapping in continuation of that bar seed. In this scheme, the corotation resonance of the bar modes does not come into play at all, justified by a low amount of disk-halo angular momentum transfer and a modestly decreasing bar pattern speed. On the other hand, although reducing the halo concentration suggests the reduction of the preferred swing-amplified modes to be bi-symmetric, the bar formation in a lowly concentrated halo does not involve the swing amplification at all. Rather, the fast-growing linearly unstable bar modes of a single uniform frequency is solely the governing factor, attributed to a mild shearing. The bar modes trigger the corotation resonance since the beginning and such resonance is maintained until the end, which leads to a high amount of angular momentum transfer and a fast slowdown. For the intermediate halo concentration, the kinematical analyses of multiple non-axisymmetric modes suggests that the linear modes, the swing amplification, and the particle trapping are all present in the evolution chronology. To specify bars formed in the different halo concentrations, full analyses of the isophotal shape, the radial Fourier amplitude, and the resonance diagram can be of use.</p>

            <p>The Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg (TTSH) equations are one of the basic equations that are used to model turbulent behaviour in active matter, specifically the swarming of bacteria in suspension. They combine features of the incompressible Navier-Stokes, the Toner-Tu and Swift-Hohenberg equations, together with the important properties that they are linearly driven, and that the Laplacian diffusion is taken to be negative in combination with hyper-dissipation. We prove that the TTSH equations possess a finite-dimensional compact global attractor on the periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^d$ ($d=2,3$) and we establish explicit estimates for its Lyapunov dimension which agree with the heuristic prediction based on the Swift-Hohenberg length scale. The predominance of this length scale (as a vortex length scale) has been observed in both numerical and experimental studies of bacterial turbulence, so our methods and results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this phenomenon. We also carry out pseudospectral direct numerical simulations of these PDEs in dimension $d=2$ through which we obtain Lyapunov spectra for representative parameter values. We show that our numerical results are consistent with the analytically derived rigorous bounds.</p>

            <p>How water droplets move and slide on leaves influences plant ecophysiological and abiotic interactions, as well as the design of advanced bio-inspired wetting materials. Despite cross-disciplinary relevance, current descriptions of the in situ dynamics of droplets on living leaves focus almost exclusively on surface structure and chemistry, treating the leaf as a static, electrically neutral substrate. Here, three decades after the mechanistic discovery of the Lotus effect, we show that a yet 'hidden' force due to instantaneous electrical phenomena affect the dynamic droplet motion on living leaves. Using high-speed motion tracking and precision charge measurements, we show that droplets sliding on the pristine epicuticular wax layer on superhydrophobic Colocasia esculenta leaves strongly charge affecting its dynamics, previously observed only on synthetic (highly electronegative fluorinated) surfaces. Droplets accumulate charges of Qp,D1 = -0.02 to -0.15 nC per 30 uL droplet on pristine leaves. However, we specifically demonstrate the crucial role of the epicuticular wax layer plasticity: by a structural modification that decreases its roughness amplitude, the same leaves gain an impressive 30-40 fold enhancement in charge transfer (reaching Qt,D1 = -2.8 to -5.2 nC) slowing the droplet by half due to an estimated electrostatic force of 11 uN dominating the resistive forces. The charge accumulation is surface-history-dependent and charge quantities per droplet are surprisingly similar or even exceeding those recently reported from artificial surfaces. Our findings prove that electrostatic charging is a fundamental component of droplet-leaf interactions, opening new research directions from charge-affected leaf ecology to sustainable materials for droplet-based energy harvesting by tuning surface treatments and, moreover,...</p>

            <h2>Finite-Time Transition to Intermittency for a Stochastic Heat Equation Driven by the Square of a Gaussian Field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philippe Mounaix</p>
            <p>In this paper, we study the spatial behavior of the solution $\psi(x,t)$ to the stochastic heat equation $\partial_t\psi(x,t)-\frac{1}{2}\partial^2_{x^2} \psi(x,t)=g\, S(x,t)^2\, \psi(x,t)$, with $0\le t\le T$, $x\in\mathbb{R}$, and $\psi(x,0)=1$. Here, $g>0$ is a coupling constant and $S(x,t)$ is a stationary, homogeneous, and ergodic Gaussian field. Focusing on $\mathcal{E}(x,g)\equiv \psi(x,T)$ at a finite time $T>0$, we identify the critical coupling $g_c(T)$ above which the average of $\mathcal{E}(0,g)$ diverges. We show that in the subcritical regime $g<g_c(T)$, $\mathcal{E}(x,g)$ is spatially ergodic, with no intermittency, while in the supercritical regime $g>g_c(T)$ it becomes spatially intermittent and loses ergodicity. Our results differ from the extensively studied case where $S(x,t)^2$ is replaced by $S(x,t)$, in which intermittency appears only asymptotically as $T\to +\infty$, with no finite-time intermittency.</p>

            <p>The global optimization of atomic clusters represents a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry and materials science due to the exponential growth of local minima with system size (i.e., the curse of dimensionality). We introduce a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the low-rank structure of potential energy surfaces through Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. Our approach combines two complementary TT-based strategies: the algebraic TTOpt method, which utilizes maximum volume sampling, and the probabilistic PROTES method, which employs generative sampling. A key innovation is the development of physically-constrained encoding schemes that incorporate molecular constraints directly into the discretization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by identifying global minima of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 45 atoms. Furthermore, we establish its practical applicability to real-world systems by optimizing 20-atom carbon clusters using a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential, achieving geometries consistent with quantum-accurate simulations. This work establishes TT-decomposition as a powerful tool for molecular structure prediction and provides a general framework adaptable to a wide range of high-dimensional optimization problems in computational material science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Halperin</p>
            <p>We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on compact two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience the competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$ (closed manifolds), and bounded cylinder $S^1 \times [0,H]$ (manifold with boundary). Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction accompanied by spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry: order emerges from the combination of two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with the manifold topology determining the character of the emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures, specifically bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. The symmetry breaking pattern depends on topology: SO(3)$\to$SO(2) on the sphere, SO(2)$\times$SO(2)$\to$SO(2)$\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the torus, and SO(2)$\to\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the cylinder. Unlike conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise through type-A diffusive Nambu-Goldstone dynamics, while the reduced-dimensional structure persists. Unlike conventional self-organizing systems that require external driving or fine-tuned nonlinearities, our model demonstrates that geometry and topology alone can channel randomness into order. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems, providing a geometric framework for understanding how disorder generates emergent spatial order on curved spaces.</p>

McSAS3GUI will help to generate and test the three configuration files that McSAS3 needs for data read-in, Monte Carlo optimization and histogramming. The user interface can also be used to process individual files or batches, and can be augmented with machine-specific use templates. The Monte Carlo (MC) approach is able to fit most practical scattering patterns extremely well, resulting in form-free model parameter distributions. Theoretically, these can be distributions on any model parameter, but in practice the MC-optimized parameter is usually a (volume-weighted) size distribution, in absolute volume fraction for absolute-scaled data.</p>

We propose a new class of RG flows between the diagonal minimal models of $\mathcal{W}_N$-algebra that take the form $\mathcal{W}_N(p,q)\to\mathcal{W}_N(p,kp-q)$. These are obtained by matching the anomalies of the non-invertible symmetry ${\mathrm{Rep}}[SU(N)_{p-N}]$ (and its discrete quotients) that is preserved by special relevant primary fields. This large non-invertible symmetry includes the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry of the minimal models. Our new flows furnish a significant generalization of the ones recently found in the case of Virasoro algebra, and include all previously known RG flows of $\mathcal{W}_N$. They have the remarkable property of being uniform in the rank $N$ of the $\mathcal{W}$-algebra.</p>

            <p>Accurately simulating long-time dynamics of many-body systems is a challenge in both classical and quantum computing due to the accumulation of Trotter errors. While low-order Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are straightforward to implement, their rapidly growing error limits access to long-time observables. We present a framework for constructing efficient high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes by identifying their structure and directly optimizing their parameters over a high-dimensional space. This method enables the discovery of new schemes with significantly improved efficiency compared to traditional constructions, such as those by Suzuki and Yoshida. Based on the theoretical efficiency and practical performance, we recommend two novel highly efficient schemes at $4^{\textrm{th}}$ and $6^{\textrm{th}}$ order. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of these decompositions on the Heisenberg model and the quantum harmonic oscillator, and find that for a fixed final time they perform better across the computational cost. Even when using large time steps, they surpass established low-order schemes like the Leapfrog. Finally, we investigate the in-practice performance of different Trotter schemes and find the decompositions with more uniform coefficients tend to feature improved error accumulation over long times. We have included this observation into our choice of recommended schemes.</p>

            <p>We propose an auxiliary-bath algorithm for the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method to solve multi-impurity models with shared electron baths. The method allows us to disentangle the electron baths into independent Wilson chains to perform standard NRG procedures beyond the widely adopted independent bath approximation. Its application to the 2-impurity model immediately reproduces the well-known even- and odd-parity channels. For 3-impurity Kondo models, we find collective screening of cluster degrees of freedom depending on impurity configurations and clarify the false prediction of a non-Fermi liquid ground state for the $C_3$ symmetric case in previous literature due to improper treatment of disentanglement. Our work highlights the importance of nonlocal spatial correlations due to shared baths and reveals a generic picture of successive collective screening for entropy depletion that is crucial in real correlated systems. Our method greatly expands the applicability of the NRG and opens an avenue for its further development.</p>

            <p>The field of electron optics exploits the analogy between the movement of electrons or charged quasiparticles, primarily in two-dimensional materials subjected to electric and magnetic (EM) fields and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium with varied refractive index. We significantly extend this analogy by introducing an electronic analogue of Fourier optics dubbed as Fourier electron optics (FEO) with massless Dirac fermions (MDF), namely the charge carriers of single-layer graphene under ambient conditions, by considering their scattering from a two-dimensional quantum dot lattice (TDQDL) treated within Lippmann-Schwinger formalism. By considering the scattering of MDF from TDQDL with a defect region, as well as the moiré pattern of twisted TDQDLs, we establish an electronic analogue of Babinet's principle in optics. Exploiting the similarity of the resulting differential scattering cross-section with the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, we construct a dictionary for such FEO. Subsequently, we evaluate the resistivity of such scattered MDF using the Boltzmann approach as a function of the angle made between the direction of propagation of these charge-carriers and the symmetry axis of the dot-lattice, and Fourier analyze them to show that the spatial frequency associated with the angle-resolved resistivity gets filtered according to the structural changes in the dot lattice, indicating wider applicability of FEO of MDF.</p>

Apart from level spacing distribution indicators like disorder-averaged mean level spacing, we also consider an intensive estimator $\mathcal{D} \in [0,1/4]$, which acts as a measure of elementary plaquettes on the lattice that are active or inert in mid-spectrum eigenstates as well as the concentration of these eigenstates in Fock space, with $\mathcal{D}$ equal to its maximum value of $1/4$ for Fock states in the electric flux basis. We calculate its distribution, $p(\mathcal{D})$, for $L_x \times L_y$ lattices, with $L_y=2$ and $4$, as a function of (a dimensionless) disorder strength $\alpha$ ($\alpha=0$ implies zero disorder) using exact diagonalization in many disorder realizations. Although finite-size estimators based on level spacings do not give a reliable critical disorder strength, $\alpha_c(L_y)$, beyond which MBL prevails as $L_x \rightarrow \infty$; a different estimator based on the skewness of $p(\mathcal{D})$ gives $\alpha_c(L_y=2)=31.04 \pm 0.54$ using data for $L_x \leq 14$ due to faster convergence. $p(\mathcal{D})$ for wider ladders with $L_y=4$ show a lower tendency to localize, suggesting a lack of MBL in two dimensions. A remarkable observation is the resolution of the (monotonic) infinite-temperature autocorrelation function of single plaquette diagonal operators in typical high-energy Fock states into a plethora of emergent timescales of increasing spatio-temporal heterogeneity as the disorder is increased. At intermediate $\alpha$ as well as for $\alpha$ slightly below $\alpha_c (L_y)$, a fraction of randomly selected initial Fock states display striking oscillatory temporal behavior of such plaquette operators in spatial regions formed out of connected plaquettes.</p>

            <h2>Universal Negative Energetic Elasticity in Polymer Chains: Crossovers among Random, Self-Avoiding, and Neighbor-Avoiding Walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nobu C. Shirai, Naoyuki Sakumichi</p>
            <p>Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity; despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</p>

            <p>We theoretically elucidate the transfer of phonon angular momentum by acoustic modes across a smooth interface between crystals. We analyze this process, which is difficult to describe with the conventional acoustic mismatch model, using a reformulated boundary condition and the Boltzmann theory. For an interface between a chiral and an achiral crystal, our analysis reveals that thermal gradients in the chiral crystal induce angular momentum, which diffuses into the achiral crystal even without heat flow. Notably, the density of angular momentum can be enhanced near the interface. These findings advance our understanding of phonon transport and its interplay with electron spins.</p>

This phenomenon has been observed in numerous systems within physics and engineering, profoundly transforming modern science and technology. Despite rapid progress, the parametric control of collective excitations, such as phonons, remains a challenge while promising to generate novel and intriguing effects in a largely unexplored field. Here, we investigate the terahertz (THz) field-induced dynamics of Raman-active phonons in the perovskite structure of LaAlO$_3$ (LAO). Utilizing intense THz pulses, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of parametric phonon excitation marked by substantial subharmonic components. Theoretical analysis can successfully capture the hallmarks of the observed phenomena in a physical scenario with the THz field inducing a parametric coupling between the Raman mode and pairs of acoustic phonon excitations.</p>

            <p>Our microscopic understanding of the integer quantum Hall effect is still incomplete. For decades, there has been a controversial discussion about "where the current flows" if the Hall resistance is quantized. Here, we qualitatively analyze the current density distribution in a Hall bar based on the screening properties of a two-dimensional electron system in the quantum Hall regime. Beyond previous publications, we include a closed loop persistent current that exists inside a Hall bar if the Hall resistance is quantized. We find, that the persistent current density decreases with increasing Hall voltage. Accounting for this dependence, we find, that the current flows in the opposite directions along opposite edges of the Hall bar, while the imposed current flows unidirectionally and only on the side of the Hall bar connected with its higher electrical potential edge.</p>

            <p>In twisted van der Waals materials, local atomic relaxation can alter the underlying electronic structure. Characterizing lattice reconstruction and its susceptibility to strain is essential for understanding emergent electronic states, especially in multilayers in which interference between moiré lattices yields larger supermoiré patterns whose energy is highly sensitive to local stacking. Here we image spatial modulations in the electronic character of helical trilayer graphene, which indicate relaxation into a superstructure of large domains with uniform moiré periodicity. We show that the supermoiré domain size is increased by strain and can be altered in the same device while preserving the local properties within each domain. Finally, we observe a higher conductance at the domain boundaries, consistent with predictions that they host counter-propagating edge modes. Our work provides a real-space visualization of moiré-periodic domains, reveals two independently tunable length scales and demonstrates strain engineering as a route towards designing correlated topological networks at the supermoiré scale.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments on planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, e.g., in Corbino geometry, have reported low-temperature nonzero Josephson currents in states with integer fluxoid (flux) induced in the junction by a perpendicular magnetic field. This effect was discussed in connection with Majorana zero modes localized in Josephson vortices of such junctions. Here, we provide an explanation for this phenomenon, attributing it to imperfections. We focus on the ``atomic" limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit, we can associate the nonvanishing critical current with the irregularities, e.g., in the junction's width. The low-temperature contribution to the current is provided by the bound states with low but nonzero energy. We also propose clear experimental tests based on microwave spectroscopy, revealing distinctive selection rules for vortex transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli</p>
            <p>(2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</p>

            <p>We study the low-energy physics of planar Josephson junction structures realized in a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor system proximity-coupled to narrow superconducting films. Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.</p>

            <p>Rare earth/transition metal (RE/TM) multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are key ingredients for the development of spintronic applications. Their compensation temperature depends on the ratio of the thicknesses of rare earth and transition metal, allowing their magnetic properties to be tuned with temperature while maintaining their anisotropy even in nanometer-scale devices. In this work, we performed a thorough structural characterization and systematically investigate the magnetic properties of a whole family of ferrimagnetic [Tb/Co]$_{\times 5}$ multilayers varying the Tb thickness in the range of 0.4 nm - 1.25 nm. A linear dependence of the compensation temperature on the Tb layer thickness was observed. Moreover, a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 330$\pm$30 kJ/m$^3$, which is close to the values reported by other authors, was estimated. Additionally, we proposed a model to gain a better understanding of the angular dependence of the magnetization loops and the linear dependence of the compensation temperature. We present strong evidence demonstrating that the perpendicular anisotropy must be tilted away from the perpendicular axis in order to explain the observed features, particularly the hysteresis in the in-plane loops. Our work advances the understanding of DC magnetic properties in thin RE/TM ferrimagnetic films, which has the potential to impact different fields where these materials are involved.</p>

            <p>Curvature plays a central role in the proper function of many biological processes. With active matter being a standard framework for understanding many aspects of the physics of life, it is natural to ask what effect curvature has on the collective behaviour of active matter. In this paper, we use the classical theory of surfaces to explore the active motion of self-propelled agents confined to move on a smooth curved two-dimensional surface embedded in Euclidean space. Even without interactions and alignment, the motion is non-trivially affected by the presence of curvature, leading to effects akin, e.g.\ to gravitational lensing and tidal forces. Such effects can lead to intermittent trapping of particles and profoundly affect their flocking behaviour. We show that these effects are governed by a geometric torque that, in the absence of noise and interactions, compels particles to move along geodesics.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of activity on dense amorphous assemblies is crucial for biological processes such as wound healing, embryogenesis, or cancer progression. Here, we study the effect of self-propulsion forces of amplitude $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$ in dense assemblies of soft repulsive particles by simulating a model particle system that interpolates between particulate active matter and biological tissues. We identify the fluid and glass phases of the three-dimensional phase diagram obtained by varying $f_0$, $\tau_p$, and the packing fraction $\phi$. The morphology of the phase diagram directly accounts for a non-monotonic evolution of the relaxation time with $\tau_p$, which is a direct consequence of the crossover in the dominant relaxation mechanism, from glassy to jamming. A second major consequence is the evolution of the glassy dynamics from sub-Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius. We show that this tunable glass fragility extends to active systems analogous observations reported for passive particles. This analogy allows us to apply a dynamic scaling analysis proposed for the passive case, in order to account for our results for active systems. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences between our results and recent findings in the context of computational models of biological tissues.</p>

            <h2>Liquid-Gas Criticality of Hyperuniform Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shang Gao, Hao Shang, Hao Hu, Yu-Qiang Ma, Qun-Li Lei</p>
            <p>In statistical physics, it is well established that the liquid-gas (LG) phase transition with divergent critical fluctuations belongs to the Ising universality class. Whether non-equilibrium effects can alter this universal behavior remains a fundamental open question. In this work, we theoretically prove that non-equilibrium hyperuniform (HU) fluids with additional center-of-mass conservation exhibit LG criticality different from the Ising universality class. As a specific case, we investigate a 2D HU fluid composed of active spinners, where phase separation is driven by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the critical point, the 2D HU fluid displays finite density fluctuations $S(q)\sim q^{\eta}$ with $\eta=0$, while the compressibility still diverges. The critical point is thus calm yet highly susceptible, in fundamental violation of the conventional fluctuation-dissipation relation. Consistently, we observe short-range pairwise correlation functions coexisting with quasi-long-range response functions at the critical point. Based on a generalized Model B and renormalization-group analysis, we prove that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical dimension $d_c$ from $4$ to $2$. Moreover, the critical point exhibits Gaussian density fluctuations and non-divergent energy fluctuations. Furthermore, the HU fluid undergoes non-conventional spinodal decomposition. The origin of the above anomalies lies in the non-equilibrium nature of the system which obeys a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation $2\mathrm{Im}~ \chi(q,\omega) ={\omega }C(q,\omega)/{k_B T_{\text{eff}}(q)}$ with a scale-dependent effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}(q) \propto q^2$. These findings establish a striking exception to conventional paradigms of critical phenomena and illustrate how non-equilibrium forces can fundamentally reshape universality classes.</p>

Leveraging the stability and propagative properties of hinge modes, these unconventional magnons demonstrate manipulability in atomic-scale modifications of termination.

            <p>Combining superconducting and magnetic materials is a promising path to generate exotic interface subgap states. In this regard, altermagnetism is particularly interesting because it lifts spin degeneracy while providing tailored anisotropy of spin splittings. Here, we investigate the realization and control of subgap states by using the symmetry contrast between altermagnetic fields and unconventional pairings. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands as the Bogoliubov Fermi surface, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of a Sokoban random walker moving in a disordered medium with obstacle density $\rho$. In contrast to the classic model of de Gennes with static obstacles that exhibits a percolation transition, the Sokoban walker is capable of modifying its environment by pushing a few surrounding obstacles. Surprisingly, even a limited pushing ability leads to a loss of the percolation transition. Through a combination of a rigorous large-deviation calculation and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the Sokoban model belongs to the Balagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan trapping universality class. The survival probability that the walker has not yet been trapped inside a cage exhibits stretched-exponential relaxation at late times. Furthermore, using the average trap size as a proxy, we identify the emergence of a dynamical crossover at a density $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ between two qualitatively different trapping mechanisms: a self-trapping mechanism at low density, where the walker becomes dynamically localized within a self-formed trap, and a pre-existing trapping mechanism at high density, where confinement arises from the initial arrangement of obstacles. This crossover is responsible for the loss of the classical percolation transition.</p>

            <p>Lattice models are powerful tools for studying strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, but their general lack of exact solutions motivates efforts to simulate them in tunable platforms. Recently, a promising new candidate has emerged for such platforms from two-dimensional materials. A subset of moiré systems can be effectively described as a two-dimensional electron gas (2D EG) subject to a moiré potential, with electron-electron interactions screened by nearby metallic gates. In this paper, we investigate the realization of lattice models in such systems. We show that, by controlling the gate separation, a 2D EG in a square moiré potential can be systematically tuned into a system whose ground state exhibits orders analogous to those of the square lattice Hubbard model, including the stripe phase. Furthermore, we study how variations in gate separation and moiré potential depth affect the ground-state orders. A number of antiferromagnetic phases, as well as a ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase, are identified. We then apply our quantitative downfolding approach to triangular moiré systems closer to current experimental conditions, compare them with the square lattice parameters studied, and outline routes for experimental realization of the phases.</p>

            <p>Durable, high-performance and eco-friendly lead-free piezoceramics are essential for next-generation sustainable energy transducers and electromechanical systems. While significant performance enhancements have been made, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics are intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working conditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical durability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key challenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a scalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the microstructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks stacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded together by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This deliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural strength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT synthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without sacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT exhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 10- to 15-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles before failure. These gains originate from anisotropic residual stress fields, revealed by Raman spectroscopy and XRD, which delay crack initiation events. Furthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and electromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based piezoelectric transducer under bending mode. Given its non-chemical-compositional origin, this bioinspired strategy could be broadly applicable to other piezoelectric material systems for applications where both functional and structural performance are critical.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiryl Pakrouski, K. V. Samokhin</p>
            <p>Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary. Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.</p>

By aligning $|\psi|^2$ with the symmetry of the crystal field, they allow rapid determination of eigenstate structures without the need for elaborate calculations. The agreement with established results indicates that these functions capture the essential physics while offering considerable computational simplification.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilles Parez, Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p>We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full system, the RLE coincides with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.</p>

            <p>We propose a new time (t)-resolved method of both vertical- and horizontal-temperature gradients in an orthogonal configuration (t-resolved T(t)-HVOT) to have real interpretations of the enhancement in thermoelectric Seebeck effect (SE) observed during the structural phase transition. We apply our new method to superionic-state semiconductors of p-type Cu2Se and n-type Ag2S. The experimental data differentiate the two types of enhancements during the phase transition: a colossal SE (Scolossal), exhibiting an enormous value of up to 5 mV/K, and a slight enhancement in SE (Sstructure), approximately 1.5-2.0 times larger than those in the absence of the phase transition. We provide critical insights that both enhancements in SE arising during the structural phase transition are not intrinsic phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Activity-driven clustering and many-body steady state of jamming run-and-tumble particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leo Hahn, Arnaud Guillin, Manon Michel</p>
            <p>We exactly resolve the three-particle steady state of run-and-tumble particles with jamming interactions, providing the first microscopic description beyond two bodies. The invariant measure, derived via a piecewise-deterministic Markov process description and symmetry principles, reveals persistent, separated, and diffusive regimes ruled by the activity parameter. A geometric cascade of scales in the activity parameter organizes the structural weights, showing the separated phase dominates at finite activity, while non-uniformity plays only a minor role. Extending these results to larger systems, we show that the $N$-body steady state inherits the same organization: the number of clusters becomes sharply defined by the activity value, with crossover boundaries whose slopes diverge with $N$. We also show how the activity plays a role similar to a fugacity conjugate to cluster number, yielding a grand-canonical-like structure emerging directly from the microscopic dynamics. This framework lays the groundwork for a systematic microscopic theory of active many-body steady states.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Mpemba effect in quasiperiodic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Shujie Cheng, Gao Xianlong</p>
            <p>We study a one-dimensional quasiperiodic tight-binding model with simultaneous off-diagonal (hopping) and diagonal (onsite) modulations. Using the inverse participation ratio and the wave-packet centroid, we construct localization-delocalization phase diagrams for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states. We analyze the robustness of initial-state properties under dissipation and characterize dissipation-induced localization-delocalization transitions (and their reversals) in detail. Trace-distance dynamics provide evidence for a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared farther from the steady state can relax faster than states initialized closer to it. We propose a starting-line hypothesis that explains the presence or absence of this effect across parameter regimes. These results advance the understanding of steady-state phase transitions and relaxation dynamics in dissipatively driven quasiperiodic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Brühlmann, Yunyoung Hwang, Jorge Puebla, Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero</p>
            <p>We provide a theory of spin and acoustic wave coupled nonlinear dynamics in continuum systems. Combining the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations with the magnetoelastic Hamiltonian, we derive classical equations of motion for the magnetization and acoustic wave amplitudes, that include magnonic nonlinearity -- both three- and four-magnon processes -- as well as linear and nonlinear magnetoelastic interactions. We focus on two-dimensional magnetic films sustaining surface acoustic waves, a geometry where our model successfully reproduces our recent experimental observation of phonon-to-magnon down-conversion under acoustic drive. We provide analytical expressions for all the rates in our equations, which make them particularly suitable for quantization. We then quantize our model, deriving Heisenberg-Langevin equations of motion for magnon and phonon operators, and show how to compute quantum expectation values in the mean field approximation. Our work paves the way toward acoustic control of magnons in the quantum regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankush Kumar Mishra, Jacob P. Mauthe, Nicholas Luke, Aram Amassian, Baskar Ganapathysubramanian</p>
            <p>To accelerate materials discovery using self-driving labs (SDLs), we present a machine learning pipeline that predicts the electrical conductivity of doped conjugated polymers using rapid, non-destructive optical spectroscopy. Our approach automates spectral featurization by combining a genetic algorithm with adaptive area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations, creating a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) that links optical response and processing parameters to conductivity. By incorporating SHAP-guided selection and domain-knowledge-based feature expansion, the model matches expert-curated performance while theoretically reducing experimental effort by $\sim 33\%$ by minimizing the need for costly direct conductivity measurements. Notably, the model recovers known physical descriptors in pBTTT and identifies informative tail-state regions correlated with polymer bleaching upon successful doping. This generic, interpretable, small-data-friendly methodology can be extended to other spectroscopic modalities, such as Raman or FTIR, providing a framework for autonomous decision-making in SDLs.</p>

            <p>In this paper we introduce a theoretical model of a metallic magnetic system with noncollinear antiferromagnetic order. We introduce a mechanism of indirect interaction of conducting fermions with localized spins based on the tunneling processes of conducting fermions through the localized spins. We demonstrate that interaction of conducting fermions with noncollinear antiferromagnetic order results in odd in momentum spin-momentum locking. The interaction resembles Rashba spin-orbit coupling but breaks the time-reversal symmetry. As a result, we show that a ferromagnet with the noncollinear antiferromagnetic order is an insulator with anomalous Hall effect occurring without any spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <p>We report the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface. Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements reveal spin-dependent electron reflectivity for enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers, indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Control experiments on clean Cu(100) and TO[11]H on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite show no such effect, excluding artifacts and chirality-induced spin selectivity as origins. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with hybrid functionals attribute the magnetism to strong chemisorption, which induces hybridization between the molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface. An extended Newns-Anderson-Grimley model incorporating on-site Coulomb repulsion in Cu d-orbitals reproduces the emergence of interfacial spin polarization above a threshold interaction strength, highlighting the key roles of hybridization parameters and Coulomb correlation. These findings reveal a mechanism for inducing magnetism at molecule-metal interfaces without inherently magnetic components, offering avenues for engineering spin-polarized states in organic-inorganic hybrid systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael Almada, Nuno Araújo, Pedro Patrício</p>
            <p>Embryonic healing in epithelial tissues is distinct from adult wound healing, as it lacks inflammatory responses or immune cell recruitments, making it ideal to test models of wound healing driven primarily by epithelial dynamics. Many models have been developed to describe this process, ranging from simple mechanistic models to more elaborate multiscale simulations. We review different classes of physical models, from discrete to continuum models, and how they address key questions about the mechanics, signaling, and coordination of cells during wound closure. We highlight tensions between model complexity and interpretability and discuss recent efforts to bridge gaps across scales. Finally, we identify directions for hybrid modeling and model-experiment integration that could push forward our understanding of epithelial repair in development and disease.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Valley Anderson Impurity for Moiré Systems: Fermi Liquid, Pairing, and Pseudogap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Jie Wang, Geng-Dong Zhou, Hyunsung Jung, Seongyeon Youn, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Zhi-Da Song</p>
            <p>Recent experiments support that the magic-angle graphene can be modeled by a periodic array of correlated quantum impurities, immersed in a Dirac sea. This work analytically tackles a spin-valley Anderson impurity, featuring a general (anti-)Hund's interaction ($J_D, J_S$) that can originate from electron-phonon couplings. We derive its full phase diagram, which encompasses rich continuous local phase transitions, and presents a unified origin for pairing potential and pseudogap. In particular, $J_D$ favors a valley doublet, and we show it drives a BKT transition out of heavy Fermi liquid, to an anisotropic doublet phase exhibiting a non-analytic zero-energy kink in the impurity spectral function. $J_S$ drives a second-order transition out of heavy Fermi liquid, to a local singlet phase, with a non-Fermi liquid critical point. We analyze the pairing potential across the phase diagram, and unveil their ubiquitous existence triggered by the (anti-)Hund's multiplet splitting. Crucially, we show the pseudogap shoulders in the spectral function represent multiplet excitations induced by an injected electron or hole. All results are obtained analytically, using techniques including bosonization-refermionization, with further verification by numerical renormalization group calculations. Then we derive the correlation self-energy ansatze that account for pseudogap, and apply to the magic-angle graphene lattice.</p>

            <p>Bernstein modes -- hybrid magnetoplasmon excitations arising from the coupling between cyclotron motion and collective oscillations in two-dimensional electron systems -- offer direct access to non-local electrodynamics. These modes can exhibit rich nonlinear behavior akin to strong-coupling phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but reaching nonlinear regime has remained experimentally challenging. Here we report the observation of nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene using terahertz excitation with near-field enhancement from embedded metallic contacts. Photoresistance spectroscopy reveals sharp resonances at Bc/2 and Bc/3 that saturate at radiation intensities nearly an order of magnitude lower than the cyclotron resonance. We ascribe this to strong local heating of the electron gas due to resonant excitation of high-amplitude Bernstein magnetoplasmons, associated with a combination of the field-concentration effect of the near field and plasmonic amplification that is resonantly enhanced in the region of Bernstein gaps. Polarization-resolved measurements further confirm the near-field origin: Bernstein resonances are insensitive to circular helicity but strongly depend on the angle of linear polarization, in sharp contrast to the cyclotron resonance response. Our results establish graphene as a platform for nonlinear magnetoplasmonics, opening opportunities for strong-field manipulation of collective electron dynamics, out-of-equilibrium electron transport, and solid-state analogues of cavity quantum electrodynamics.</p>

We demonstrate here efficient magnetically tunable THz amplitude control in ultrathin, exchange-biased Co/Pt/Co/IrMn spin valve. Terahertz spintronic magnetometry resolves reversible switching between parallel and antiparallel magnetization states and correlates the high- and low-emission regimes with constructive and destructive interference of charge transients generated by the inverse spin Hall effect in the Pt spacer. A residual low-emission signal is traced to spin-to-charge conversion in IrMn. Phase inversion under front- versus back-side excitation confirms the ISHE origin of the emission, while a macrospin Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert model reproduces the field dependence of its amplitude and separates layer-specific contributions. Together, these results define a wafer-compatible spin valve device architecture that enables efficient, low-field THz amplitude control.</p>

            <h2>Compatibilities and supercompatibility conditions in shape memory alloys determined from correspondence, metrics and symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cyril Cayron</p>
            <p>The phenomenological theory of martensite crystallography (PTMC) developed in the 1950s explains the main crystallographic and microstructural features of martensite in shape memory alloys, such as the habit planes of bi-variant laminate martensite product, and the transformation twins between the variants. It also permits to determine the austenite and martensite lattice parameters that allow supercompatibility, which has driven important research and development of new shape memory alloys with low hysteresis and high cyclability. Supercompatibility takes the form of three mathematical equations called cofactor conditions. The calculations are in great part based mathematical tools from continuum mechanics (polar decompositions and stretch tensors). They were recently replaced by pure crystallographic tools (metric tensors, group of symmetries and correspondence) in an alternative approach called correspondence theory (CT). The CT allows for the direct calculation of the transformation twins and their generic and non-generic characteristics. These twins ensure the compatibility at martensite/martensite (M/M) junction planes. Here, we show that the CT can also be used to determine the conditions of austenite/martensite (A/M) compatibility, and A/M/M supercompatibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir P. Golubinskii, Vladimir A. Zyuzin</p>
            <p>We propose and theoretically study minimal models of Néel ordered collinear (compensated) antiferromagnets that show the anomalous Hall effect. For simplicity, we first consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. We provide explicit examples of a Néel ordered ferrimagnet and a Dzyaloshinskii weak ferromagnet. Then antiferromagnet on the rutile lattice, that belongs to the class of weak ferromagnets, is studied. We analyze Dzyaloshinskii's invariants for the existence of spontaneous magnetization in these Néel ordered systems. Microscopic calculations of the Berry curvature for the studied systems confirm the validity of these Dzyaloshinskii's invariants. It is shown that the anomalous Hall effect mechanism in these antiferromagnets arises either from the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the Néel order and the spin-orbit coupling. These physical processes originate from the broken symmetries that permit the Dzyaloshinskii's invariant in the system.</p>

            <h2>Precise, efficient and flexible modeling of crystallizing elastomers based on physics-augmented neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konrad Friedrichs, Franz Dammaß, Karl A. Kalina, Markus Kästner</p>
            <p>We propose a precise and efficient physics-augmented neural network (PANN) to model strain-induced crystallization in rubbery polymers. We demonstrate that the model can be flexibly employed for both unfilled and filled natural rubber (NR). The approach is based on a two potential framework, similar to the concept of generalized standard materials (GSMs). To describe the material behavior, neural network-based free energy and dissipation potentials are employed. The evolution of crystallinity is derived from the two potentials. To ensure boundedness of the crystallinity, a novel constrained GSM-type evolution problem is proposed. To this end, two additional Lagrange multipliers together with the corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are introduced. As a result, it is guaranteed that crystallinity can be interpreted as a variable of concentration type. The neural network-based potentials ensure all physically desirable properties by construction. Most importantly, objectivity, material symmetry and thermodynamic consistency are automatically fulfilled. In addition, an alternative derivation of the governing model equations in time-discrete form is presented based on an incremental variational framework, which also serves as the basis for a finite element implementation. We demonstrate the predictive capability of the PANN using three different experimental data sets from literature, considering both stress and crystallinity evolution at material point level as well as the corresponding field distributions in a notched specimen. Moreover, we show that model parameterization is also possible when experimental crystallinity data is not available, still enabling suitable stress predictions.</p>

            <h2>Real-space formulation of the Chern invariant and topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiminori Hattori, Shinji Nakata</p>
            <p>In this paper, we formulate the real-space Chern number in a supercell framework. In this framework, the overlap matrix between two corners of the Brillouin zone (BZ) is derived from diagonalizing the real-space Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions. The pass-ordered product of overlap matrices around the BZ boundary forms a Wilson loop, and defines the Chern number in real space. It is analytically shown that the real-space Chern number is quantized at integers for large enough systems and coincides with the Bott index used in the previous studies. The formulation is greatly simplified for the former so that it makes numerical computations more efficient. The real-space formula is used to numerically elucidate topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator. The Chern insulator is modeled by dimensional extension of the Rice-Mele (RM) model consisting of two sublattices, and is disordered by including a random onsite potential. As disorder strength increases, the nontrivial-to-trivial phase transition takes place for normal disorder with no sublattice polarization. By contrast, the phase diagram is almost unaffected by polarized disorder, indicating that nontrivial topology persists against disorder. These observations are supported by the linear conductance and the density of bulk states.</p>

            <p>Among all excitonic complexes in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), dark and semi-dark trions are poised to play a stellar role in future quantum technologies due to their long lifetimes, about two orders of magnitude greater than those of their bright counterparts. In monolayer (ML) tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$), accessing these states via a suitable brightening mechanism remains challenging, specially, at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the brightening of dark trions from ML WS$_2$ over the temperature range, 83 K-115 K, enabled by localized surface plasmon modes in a disordered gold substrate. The resulting photoluminescence (PL) spectrum reveals a distinct spectral doublet with the twin peaks of semi-dark and bright trion states, separated by $\sim$ 45 meV. The origin of the semi-dark trion state lies in intervalley electron-electron scatterings, while its visibility in the PL spectrum is made possible by the enhanced out-of-plane electromagnetic field associated with plasmon localization. We also report on the negative degree of circular polarization in ML WS$_2$ at the energy of the semi-dark trion state. Our results establish a scalable plasmonic route to access valley-polarized semi-dark trions, opening new opportunities for quantum and valleytronic applications.</p>

We demonstrate the ability of common LLM tools (ChatGPT, DeepSeek) to suggest and justify prediction methods in a dialogue with the user under conditions of incomplete information about the physical models of PSC degradation and the influence of the environment, providing rather accurate prediction. The results cover the formation of time series of efficiency with a given architecture, calculated using various available mathematical models together with environmental characteristics archived in various meteorological databases (illumination, temperature, humidity, UV level). We conclude that ChatGPT currently has sufficient access to training samples, can suggest to PSC designer various PSC models in the literature, and has adequate solutions for predicting degradation trends.</p>

            <p>Artificially engineered lattices provide a flexible platform for reproducing and extending the electronic behavior of atomic-scale materials. Artificial graphene systems, in particular, mimic graphene-like linear dispersion with tunable Dirac cones and offer a route to realizing more exotic band structures. Here we examine the emergence of quartic energy dispersion in artificial graphene heterostructures using analytical modeling and numerical solutions of the effective Hamiltonian. We identify three distinct quartic band types: Mexican-hat-shaped (MHS), purely quartic, and non-MHS quartic bands, and determine the conditions under which each arises. We find that a staggered honeycomb lattice supports all three classes of quartic dispersion, whereas its planar counterpart yields only purely quartic and non-MHS forms. These results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering quartic band edges in artificial lattices and clarify how lattice geometry can be used to tailor their characteristics.</p>

            <p>Understanding and controlling spin dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets is essential for their application in magnonics and hybrid quantum platforms. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the vdW ferromagnet 1T-CrTe_{2} and demonstrate their systematic tunability via niobium (Nb) substitution in Cr_{1-x}Nb_{x}Te_{2}(x=0-0.2). Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy reveals that Nb doping enables wide-band tuning of the resonance frequency from 40 GHz down to the few-GHz regime, accompanied by a moderate increase in the Gilbert damping constant from ~0.066 to ~0.14, while preserving robust room-temperature ferromagnetism. Complementary magnetometry shows a concurrent reduction of the Curie temperature and saturation magnetization with increasing Nb content. Density functional theory calculations attribute the observed spin-dynamic trends to Nb-induced modifications of magnetic anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, CrTe_{2} flakes (~100nm thick) exhibit lower resonance frequencies than bulk crystals, consistent with thickness-dependent magnetic anisotropy. These results establish Nb-doped CrTe_{2} as a tunable vdW ferromagnet with controllable spin dynamics, extending its functionality from spintronics to broadband magnonics and quantum magnonics.</p>

            <p>In this work, we determine the dissociation temperature of the hydrogen (H$_2$) hydrate by computer simulation using two different methods. In both cases, the molecules of water and H$_2$ are modeled using the TIP4P/Ice and a modified version of the Silvera and Goldman models respectively, and the Berthelot combining rule for the cross water-H$_2$ interactions has been modified. The first method used in this work is the solubility method which consists in determining the solubility of H$_2$ in an aqueous phase when in contact with a H$_2$ hydrate (H--L$_{\text{w}}$) phase and when in contact with a pure H$_2$ phase (L$_{\text{w}}$--L$_{\text{H}_2}$) at different temperatures. At a given pressure value, both solubility curves intersect at the temperature ($T_3$) at which the three phases coexist in equilibrium. Following this approach, we determine the dissociation temperature of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$ finding a good agreement with the data previously reported in the literature. We also analyze the effect of the multiple occupancy of the D, or small, and H, or large, cages of the sII hydrate structure. We conclude that the $T_3$ value is barely affected by the occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$. From the analysis of the solubility curves and performing extra bulk simulations of the three phases involved in the equilibrium, we also determine the driving force for nucleation ($\Delta\mu^{\text{EC}}_{N}$) at $185\,\text{MPa}$ as a function of the supercooling degree and the H$_2$ hydrate occupancy. We determine that, thermodynamically, the most favored occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate consists of 1 H$_2$ molecule in the D cages and 3 in the H cages (named as 1-3 occupancy).</p>

            <h2>Temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization of Ni2MnGa and other ferromagnets. The superellipse equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Perevertov</p>
            <p>The temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization of Ni2MnGa and other ferromagnets can be described in reduced coordinates by the superellipse equation using a single dimensionless parameter. This critical exponent parameter equals 2.4 for Ni2MnGa, 2.7 for nickel and cobalt, 3.0 for iron and 2.05 for gadolinium. Because reduced magnetization and reduced temperature enter the equation symmetrically, the Ms(T) dependence can be measured only in the low temperature range, from 0 to 0.5Tc. The magnetization curve from 0.5Tc to Tc can then be obtained by interchanging reduced magnetization and temperature in the superellipse equation. In this way, the experimentally challenging task of measuring spontaneous magnetization near Tc is avoided, as the behavior near Tc is effectively determined from measurements performed near T = 0. The Ms(T) dependence in a whole temperature range is fully determined by two parameters - the Curie temperature, Ts and the critical exponent, n.</p>

            <p>The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered, which yields a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of the absolute value of Euler characteristic in finite-size graphs near to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</p>

            <h2>Prediction of superconductivity in mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Nashabeh, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>We study density-balanced, mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers as a tunable platform for correlated quantum phases. With independent control of carrier density and interlayer separation, the system exhibits a rich phase diagram, including exciton condensates, Wigner crystals, and for large hole-to-electron mass ratios, an electron-liquid hole-crystal phase. This mixed phase is an analog of two-dimensional metallic hydrogen, featuring an electron liquid immersed in and coupled to a lattice of heavy holes. We show that acoustic plasmons mediate an attractive interaction between electrons, leading to BCS-type superconductivity at experimentally accessible parameters. The superconducting transition temperature is calculated from first principles, and experimental realization in van der Waals heterostructures is discussed.</p>

            <p>Strong Coulomb interactions in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors give rise to tightly bound excitons, exciton polarons, and correlated electronic phases such as Wigner crystals (WCs), yet their mutual interplay remains poorly understood. Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective. These results establish WC polarons as a new quasiparticle paradigm and introduce polaron-induced Umklapp scattering as a general route to accessing finite-momentum many-body excitations in 2D quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Additive-Functional Approach to Transport in Periodic and Tilted Periodic Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang Yang, Zhixin Peng</p>
            <p>In this Letter, we clarify the physical origin of effective transport in periodic and tilted periodic systems. When Brownian dynamics is examined on the scale of a single period, the particle displacement admits a natural separation into a bounded part associated with recurrent motion within the periodic landscape, and an unbounded stochastic part that grows in time and carries the net transport. We show that effective drift and diffusion are governed entirely by this unbounded component, while local potential-induced fluctuations contribute only bounded corrections. Treating the displacement as an additive functional of the stochastic dynamics provides a rigorous formulation of this separation and leads to a corrector-martingale representation at the trajectory level. Within this framework, classical results-including the Lifson-Jackson formula for unbiased periodic systems and the Stratonovich expressions for tilted periodic potentials-follow as direct consequences of the same underlying structure. The same perspective extends naturally to higher-dimensional periodic environments, recovering the standard homogenized transport tensors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan-Wei Zhang, Ling-Zhi Tang</p>
            <p>Topological states of matter in disordered systems without translation symmetry have attracted great interest in recent years. These states with topological characters are not only robust against certain disorders, but also can be counterintuitively induced by disorders from a topologically trivial phase in the clean limit. In this review, we summarize the current theoretical and experimental progress on disorder-induced topological phases in both condensed-matter and artificial systems. We first introduce the topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) induced by random disorders and their topological characterizations and experimental realizations. We then discuss various extensions of TAIs with unique localization phenomena in quasiperiodic and non-Hermitian systems. We also review the theoretical and experimental studies on the disorder-induced topology in dynamical and many-body systems, including topological Anderson-Thouless pumps, disordered correlated topological insulators and average-symmetry protected topological orders acting as interacting TAI phases. Finally, we conclude the review by highlighting potential directions for future explorations.</p>

            <h2>Influence of intraspecies interactions on the diversity of the wetting phase diagram in dilute ternary Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nguyen Van Thu</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of intraspecies interactions on the structure and diversity of the wetting phase diagram in a dilute ternary Bose-Einstein condensates. Within the GP formalism, we employ the double-parabola approximation to describe the interfacial properties of the system in the limit of strong segregation between two of the components. Our analysis focuses on the static behavior near degenerate points where distinct phase boundaries intersect in the parameter space defined by the healing-length ratios. We demonstrate that the first-order and critical wetting transition lines, along with the nucleation line intersect at a unique degenerate point. This finding contrasts with previous studies in the interspecies interaction space, where two degenerate points were observed. These results provide new insights into the interfacial phase behavior of multicomponent quantum gases and offer theoretical guidance for experimental explorations of wetting phenomena in ultracold atomic systems.</p>

            <h2>Exciton-Anyon Binding in Fractional Chern Insulators: Spectral Fingerprints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianhong Lu, Luiz H. Santos</p>
            <p>Transition--metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) uniquely combine topological electronic states realized without external magnetic fields with a strong optical response arising from long--lived excitons. Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moiré TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Reich, Kiryl Piasotski, Eytan Grosfeld, Alexander Shnirman</p>
            <p>We study planar Josephson junctions formed on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator (Fu-Kane proposal) and examine the experimentally relevant parameter regimes in which the effective velocity of the emergent one-dimensional Majorana modes approaches zero. We show that the frequently employed Fu-Kane effective theory breaks down in this case. As parameters like the chemical potential or the width of the junction are tuned, instances of vanishing effective velocity mark the emergence of additional 'Dirac cones' at zero energy and finite momentum. If the junction is subjected to an external magnetic field, Josephson vortices may then bind a number of zero modes in addition to the topological Majorana mode. The additional zero modes are 'symmetry-protected' and can be lifted by a broken mirror symmetry (which is to be expected in realistic scenarios) as well as by an in-plane magnetization (or Zeeman field). We note that the ensuing presence of additional low-energy Andreev states can significantly contribute to measured quantities like the Josephson current or microwave absorption spectra.</p>

            <p>In this work, three InAs/InAs$_{0.65}$Sb$_{0.35}$ superlattices with different periods were investigated using photoluminescence and photoreflectance measurements and their band structure was simulated using a 14 bulk-band kp model.

After identifying which of these are related to the superlattice mini-bands, a rich collection of observed higher-order optical transitions was compared with refractive-index calculations. This procedure was used to adjust the parameters of the theoretical model, namely the bowing parameters of the InAsSb valence band offset and bandgap. It was also shown that the spectroscopy of the higher-order states combined with numerical modeling of the refractive index is a powerful tool for improvement of the material parameters, presenting a new approach to material studies of advanced semiconductor heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics. We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, microampere currents, 2 MHz speeds and ~250 fJ per nonlinear operation, with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales. We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emily Townsend, Joshua Pomeroy, Garnett W. Bryant</p>
            <p>We derive a modified Lindblad equation for the state of quantum dot tunnel coupled to a Markovian lead when the spin state of the dot is driven by an oscillating magnetic field. We show that the equation is a completely positive, trace-preserving map and find the jump operators. This is a driven-dissipative regime in which coherent driving is relevant to the tunneling and cannot be treated as simply a rotation modifying the system with a bath derived under a static magnetic field. This work was motivated by an experimental desire to determine the Zeeman splitting of an electron spin on a quantum dot (a spin qubit), and in a related work we show that this splitting energy can be found by measuring the charge occupancy of the dot while sweeping the frequency of the driving field \ arXiv:2503.17481. Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.</p>

            <p>Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</p>

            <p>Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) show evidence that they are protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.</p>

We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Cioni, Roberto Menta, Riccardo Aiudi, Marco Polini, Vittorio Giovannetti</p>
            <p>The processing unit of a solid-state quantum computer consists in an array of coupled qubits, each locally driven with on-chip microwave lines that route carefully-engineered control signals to the qubits in order to perform logical operations. This approach to quantum computing comes with two major problems. On the one hand, it greatly hampers scalability towards fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are estimated to need a number of qubits -- and, therefore driving lines -- on the order of $10^6$. On the other hand, these lines are a source of electromagnetic noise, exacerbating frequency crowding and crosstalk, while also contributing to power dissipation inside the dilution fridge. We here tackle these two overwhelming challenges by presenting a novel quantum processing unit (QPU) for a universal quantum computer which is globally (rather than locally) driven. Our QPU relies on a string of superconducting qubits with always-on ZZ interactions, enclosed into a closed geometry, which we dub ``conveyor belt''. Strikingly, this architecture requires only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ physical qubits to run a computation on $N$ computational qubits, in contrast to previous $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ proposals for global quantum computation. Additionally, universality is achieved via the implementation of single-qubit gates and a one-shot Toffoli gate. The ability to perform multi-qubit operations in a single step could vastly improve the fidelity and execution time of many algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben T. McDonough, Chao Yin, Andrew Lucas, Carolyn Zhang</p>
            <p>Lieb-Robinson bounds demonstrate the emergence of locality in many-body quantum systems. Intuitively, Lieb-Robinson bounds state that with local or exponentially decaying interactions, the correlation that can be built up between two sites separated by distance $r$ after a time $t$ decays as $\exp(vt-r)$, where $v$ is the emergent Lieb-Robinson velocity. In many problems, it is important to also capture how much of an operator grows to act on $r^d$ sites in $d$ spatial dimensions. Perturbation theory and cluster expansion methods suggest that at short times, these volume-filling operators are suppressed as $\exp(-r^d)$ at short times. We confirm this intuition, showing that for $r > vt$, the volume-filling operator is suppressed by $\exp(-(r-vt)^d/(vt)^{d-1})$. This closes a conceptual and practical gap between the cluster expansion and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We then present two very different applications of this new bound. Firstly, we obtain improved bounds on the classical computational resources necessary to simulate many-body dynamics with error tolerance $\epsilon$ for any finite time $t$: as $\epsilon$ becomes sufficiently small, only $\epsilon^{-O(t^{d-1})}$ resources are needed. A protocol that likely saturates this bound is given. Secondly, we prove that disorder operators have volume-law suppression near the "solvable (Ising) point" in quantum phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking, which implies a new diagnostic for distinguishing many-body phases of quantum matter.</p>

            <p>We show that a simple nonlinear differential equation (originally studied in the physics of disordered systems) is able to mathematically describe the global population growth over the past 12000 years. Different regimes of population growth since the early Neolithic until today are shown to be all solutions to the same nonlinear differential equation in its various limits. These also include the well-known Malthus (exponential) and Verhulst (logistic) growth regimes, as well as von Foerster's ``doomsday'' formula. All these limits correspond to neglecting higher-order terms in a more general nonlinear dynamic model described by the proposed nonlinear differential equation. While the older models may provide valid fittings to limited time intervals in the global population growth curve in time, their clearly approximate nature prevents them from being predictive over longer periods of time. The proposed comprehensive solution of the proposed model is instead well suited to provide predictions for future scenarios. These include halving of the global population as early as 2064 due to resource depletion, if the effect of the Earth's limited carrying capacity were to set in today.</p>

Our approach extends a previously developed PMR-QMC method for spin-1/2 Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013281 (2024)]. Because it does not rely on a local bond decomposition, the method applies equally well to models with arbitrary connectivities, long-range and multi-spin interactions, and its closed-walk formulation allows a natural analysis of sign-problem conditions in terms of cycle weights. To demonstrate its applicability and versatility, we apply our method to spin-1 and spin-3/2 quantum Heisenberg models on the square lattice, as well as to randomly generated high-spin Hamiltonians. Additionally, we show how the approach naturally extends to general Hamiltonians involving mixtures of particle species, including bosons and fermions.

Superconducting microwave resonators provide highly efficient storage, long coherence times, on-demand reading and even in memory pulse engineering, but it is still challenging to overcome design and materials induced loss channels for on-chip realization. In this work, we present a novel architecture of integrated superconducting quantum memory with a dynamically controlled RF-SQUID coupling element in pulse regime, thus ensuring high efficiency storage and cycling storage time. It demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and 57.5% storage fidelity with preservation of the stored pulse shape during the retrieval at single-photon level excitations. We establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching and materials imperfections. Still the device was used only for storing finite-duration near-single-photon classical microwave pulses, we assert that it operates as a linear device when the photon population in the common resonator remains low so it should be compatible with quantum state this http URL proposed architecture highlights a disruptive potential for on-chip qubit and memory integration for scalable quantum error correction, while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avik Chakraborty, Manavendra Mahato</p>
            <p>The chiral SYK model is an 1+1 dimensional generalisation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with chiral Majorana fermions and homogeneous random interactions. In the large N limit, the model admits an exact solution of the two-point function due to its scaling symmetry and exhibits a quantised thermal Hall conductance consistent with that of a 2+1 dimensional gapped topological system. We study two chiral SYK systems coupled by a relevant quadratic interaction that explicitly breaks scaling and time reversal symmetry. Working in the regime of weak intersystem coupling, we solve the Dyson-Schwinger equations perturbatively and obtain analytic expressions for two-point functions at finite temperature. Unlike the coupled SYK model in 0+1 dimensions, the 1+1 dimensional chiral system does not develop a mass gap, and no thermal phase transition is observed. We show that the leading correction to the thermodynamic free energy is temperature-independent, implying that the entropy density remains identical to that of two uncoupled chiral SYK systems. A real-time analysis of the retarded correlator reveals the emergence of massless collective bosonic modes propagating between the two subsystems at zero temperature, signalling quasiparticle tunnelling without gap generation. Our results demonstrate a sharp qualitative distinction between relevant deformations of SYK models in zero and one spatial dimensions, and highlight the robustness of gapless chiral edge dynamics against explicit scaling symmetry-breaking interactions.</p>

We show that the SAXS data can be analysed using a simple polymer model which nevertheless quantitatively describes the average persistence length and torsional rigidity of the DNA double helix to determine the statistical distribution of local conformations of the DNA in solution to a high accuracy. Although the SAXS data is averaged over time and all spatial orientations of the molecules, for sequences which have some asymmetry in the data we show that the conformations can be oriented with respect to the sequence. This allows specific features detected by the analysis to be precisely related to the DNA sequence, opening up new opportunities for SAXS to investigate the properties of DNA in solution. The biological implications of these results are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saptarshi Mandal, Pieter W. Claeys, Sthitadhi Roy</p>
            <p>Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation-driven topological phase transitions in open quantum systems independent of system Hamiltonian</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian-Shu Deng, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>We investigate dissipation-driven topological phase transitions in one-dimensional quantum open systems governed by the Lindblad equation with linear dissipation operators, which ensure the density matrix retains its Gaussian form throughout the dynamics. By employing the modular Hamiltonian framework, we rigorously demonstrate that the $\rm{Z}_2$ topological invariant characterizing steady states in one-dimensional class D systems is exclusively dependent on the dissipation operators, rather than the system Hamiltonian. Through a sudden quench protocol where the system evolves from the steady state of one Lindbladian to another, we reveal that topological transitions can occur at analytically predictable critical times, even when the initial and final steady states share identical topological indices. These transitions are shown, both analytically and numerically, to depend solely on dissipation parameters. Entanglement spectrum analysis demonstrates bulk-edge correspondence in non-equilibrium density matrices via coexisting single-particle gap closures (periodic boundaries) and topologically protected zero modes (open boundaries), directly underpinning the detection of dissipation-induced topology in quantum simulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benoît Ferté, Davide Farci, Xiangyu Cao</p>
            <p>We characterize monitored quantum dynamics in a solvable model exhibiting a phase transition between a measurement apparatus and a scrambler. We show that approximate decoherent histories emerge in both phases with respect to a coarse-grained extensive observable. However, the apparatus phase, where quantum Darwinism emerges, is distinguished by the non-ergodicity of the histories and their correlation with the measured qubit, which selects an ensemble of preferred pointer states. Our results demonstrate a clear distinction between two notion of classicality, decoherent histories and environment-induced decoherence.</p>

            <h2>Saddle Hierarchy in Dense Associative Memory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Thériault, Daniele Tantari</p>
            <p>Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related to cutting edge machine learning paradigms, such as the attention mechanism and generative diffusion. We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating the Limits of QAOA Parameter Transfer at High-Rounds on Sparse Ising Models With Geometrically Local Cubic Terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah Pelofske, Marek Rams, Andreas Bärtschi, Piotr Czarnik, Paolo Braccia, Lukasz Cincio, Stephan Eidenbenz</p>
            <p>The emergent practical applicability of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for approximate combinatorial optimization is a subject of considerable interest. One of the primary limitations of QAOA is the task of finding a set of good parameters. Parameter transfer is a phenomenon where QAOA angles trained on problem instances that are self-similar tend to perform well for other problem instances from that similar class. This suggests a potentially highly efficient and scalable non-variational learning method for QAOA angle finding. We systematically study QAOA parameter transferability from small problems (16, 27 qubits) onto large problem instances (up to 156 qubits) for heavy-hex graph Ising models with geometrically local higher order terms using the Julia based QAOA simulation tool JuliQAOA to perform classical angle finding for up to 49 QAOA layers. Parameter transfer of the fixed angles is validated using a combination of full statevector, Projected Entangled Pair States, Matrix Product State, and LOWESA numerical simulations. We find that the QAOA parameter transfer from single instances applied to unseen problem instances does not in general provide monotonically improving performance as a function of p - there are many cases where the performance temporarily decreases as a function of p - but despite this the transferred angles have a general trend of improved expectation value as the QAOA depth increases, in many cases converging close to the true ground-state energy of the 100+ qubit instances. We also sample the hardware-compatible Ising models using the ensemble of fixed QAOA angles on several superconducting qubit IBM Quantum processors with 127, 133, and 156 qubits. We find continuous solution quality improvement of the hardware-compatible QAOA circuits run on the IBM NISQ processors up to p=5 on ibm_fez, p=9 on ibm_torino, and p=10 on ibm_pittsburgh.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Benini, Pasquale Calabrese, Michele Fossati, Amartya Harsh Singh, Marco Venuti</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is an observable in quantum systems, constructed using quantum-information methods, suited to detecting symmetry breaking in states -- possibly out of equilibrium -- relative to a subsystem. In this paper we define the asymmetry for generalized finite symmetries, including higher-form and noninvertible ones. To this end, we introduce a "symmetrizer" of (reduced) density matrices with respect to the $C^*$-algebra of symmetry operators acting on the subsystem Hilbert space. We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Rodrigues, F. J. Galindo-Rosales, L. Campo-Deaño</p>
            <p>A microfluidic approach to probing the first normal stress difference from single-point pressure measurements in transient shear flows is presented. Using an original experimental design, we examine the near-zero-mean pulsatile flow of polymeric solutions in a straight microchannel at low Reynolds and Womersley numbers. An important aspect of this work is that the enhanced fluid elastic stresses can be efficiently determined via the pressure shift measured from pressure-controlled pulsatile shear experiments. We find a scaling law that collapses pressure-shift data from viscoelastic fluids of different molecular weights onto a single master curve that can then be used to predict this phenomenology. Taken together, these results could help shed light on our understanding of the non-linear normal stress responses in time-dependent flows.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brenden Roberts, Jin Ming Koh, Yi Tan, Norman Y. Yao</p>
            <p>The existence of self-correcting quantum memories in three dimensions is a long-standing open question at the interface between quantum computing and many-body physics. We take the perspective that large contributions to the entropy arising from fine-tuned spatial symmetries, including the assumption of an underlying regular lattice, are responsible for fundamental challenges to realizing self-correction. Accordingly, we introduce a class of disordered quantum codes, which we call "cored product codes". These codes are derived from classical factors via the hypergraph product but undergo a coring procedure which allows them to be embedded in a lower number of spatial dimensions while preserving code properties. As a specific example, we focus on a fractal code based on the aperiodic pinwheel tiling as the classical factor and perform finite temperature numerical simulations on the resulting three-dimensional quantum memory. We provide evidence that, below a critical temperature, the memory lifetime increases with system size for codes up to 60000 qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Izzatjon Allayarov, Andrey B. Evlyukhin, Antonio Calà Lesina</p>
            <p>Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.</p>

            <p>We engineer lumped-element superconducting resonators that maximize magnetic coupling to molecular spin qubits, achieving record single-spin couplings up to $100$ kHz and collective couplings exceeding $10$ MHz. The resonators interact with PTMr organic free radicals, model spin systems with $S=1/2$ and a quasi-isotropic $g \simeq 2$, dispersed in polymer matrices. The highest collective spin-photon coupling strengths are attained with resonators having large inductors, which therefore interact with most spins in the molecular ensemble. By contrast, the coupling of each individual spin $G_{1}$ is maximized in resonators having a minimum size inductor, made of a single wire. The same platform has been used to study spin relaxation and spin coherent dynamics in the dispersive regime, when spins are energetically detuned from the resonator. We find evidences for the Purcell effect, i.e. the photon induced relaxation of those spins that are most strongly coupled to the circuit. The rate of this process gives access to the distribution of single spin photon couplings in a given device. For resonators with a $50$ nm wide constriction at the inductor center, single maximum $G_{1}$ values reach $\sim 100$ kHz. Pumping the spins with strong pulses fed through an independent transmission line induces coherent Rabi oscillations. The spin excitation then proceeds via either direct resonant processes induced by the main pulse frequency or, in the case of square-shaped pulses, via the excitation of the cavity by sideband frequency components. The latter process measures the cavity mode hybridization with the spins and can be eliminated by using Gaussian shaped pulses. These results establish a scalable route toward integrated molecular-spin quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement as a Cohomological Obstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Ikeda</p>
            <p>We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental validation. Detailed numerical implementations for concrete quantum many-body models are presented in the companion paper \cite{2026arXiv260113467I}.</p>

            <p>Strongly-confined perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) offer opportunities not found in conventional isotropic nanocubes, especially in producing linearly polarized light, as well as enhancing outcoupling through control over the transition dipole moment. But this requires ultrathin nanoplatelets with three or fewer monolayers of PbI6 octahedra across the thickness, which are challenging to synthesise uniformly, and their luminescence is strongly affected by surface defects. Together, these limit the performance of ultrathin PeNPLs in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. We demonstrate that ligands with phosphoryl functional groups strongly bind to the perovskite surface, while having an organic backbone that is not sterically bulky ensures high ligand density. By modulating nucleation and growth, these ancillary ligands lead to monodisperse PeNPLs that stack more uniformly when self-assembled into superlattices, with suppressed agglomeration. As a result, from edge-up PeNPL superlattices, we achieve enhanced degree of polarization, while from face-down PeNPL superlattices, we achieve enhanced outcoupling that results in LEDs with 13.1% external quantum efficiency, the highest reported for ultrathin PeNPL LEDs. This work establishes ancillary ligand-induced synthesis as a decisive route to achieve uniform nanoplatelets with robust orientation control, enabling full utilization of the multifunctionality of anisotropic PeNPLs.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic reconnection as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: The topological origin of Bohm resistivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magnus F Ivarsen</p>
            <p>The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta \propto T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the ensemble of electron gyro-axes in a magnetized plasma as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the mean magnetic field. Unlike stochastic turbulence models, this framework predicts a coherent, explosive onset of resistivity that naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. We support this thesis with renormalization group theory and a novel analysis of Magnetospheric Multiscale mission data, which reveals an explosive phase space confinement consistent with collective phase slippage rather than chaotic scattering. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</p>

We show that the equation is a completely positive, trace-preserving map and find the jump operators.

Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.</p>

Bromide co-adsorbates play a decisive role by guiding molecular alignment, inducing surface atom displacements, and enabling transient adsorption geometries that activate otherwise Raman-inactive vibrational modes. In the absence of bromide, distinct excitation pathways emerge, reflecting competition between optomechanical coupling and charge-transfer processes associated with molecular polarization along the optical field or orientation relative to the metal surface. These results establish molecular optomechanics as a sensitive probe of surface-molecule interactions and demonstrate how anion-mediated surface dynamics regulate energy flow at plasmonic interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiyi Pan, Jaroslav Fabian</p>
            <p>The Edelstein effect, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and is therefore highly promising for future spintronic devices, can be realized and non-volatilely manipulated in ferroelectric materials owing to their broken inversion symmetry and switchable polarization states. To date, most ferroelectric systems reported to exhibit the Edelstein effect are semiconductors, requiring extrinsic doping for functionality. In contrast, the Edelstein effect has rarely been reported in metallic ferroelectric systems, where doping is unnecessary. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that a pronounced Edelstein effect can be realized in the recently proposed intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$ monolayer, where the sign of the Edelstein coefficient is coupled to the direction of ferroelectric polarization through the polarization-switching-induced reversal of spin textures, thereby enabling non-volatile control of charge-spin conversion. The Edelstein effect reaches a magnitude of $10^{11}~\hbar/(\textup{A} \cdot \textup{cm})$, which is sizable compared to previously reported ferroelectric systems. Microscopically, the Edelstein effect in a PtBi$_2$ monolayer originates from competing contributions of inner Rashba-like electron pockets and outer hole pockets with opposite signs; an upward shift of the Fermi level alters their balance and can reverse the sign of the Edelstein effect. Upon applying biaxial strain, the Fermi-surface electronic structure is strongly modified, resulting in a pronounced change of the Edelstein effect: a 2 \% compressive strain suppresses the Edelstein effect by about 50 \%. Our results not only identify a promising material platform for tunable charge-spin conversion but also provide new insights into the functional potential of metallic ferroelectric systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hriticka Dhiman, Soniya Chaudhary</p>
            <p>An analytical model is developed to investigate the interaction of quasi longitudinal (qP) waves with a perfectly bonded interface between a thermo piezoelectric half space and a functionally graded piezoelectric half space. The formulation is based on the fractional order Lord Shulman generalized thermoelasticity theory, which provides an enhanced description of coupled thermo electro mechanical wave behaviour. Rotational effects are incorporated into the constitutive relations and equations of motion for both media, while the lower half space is assumed to be subjected to initial stress. Closed form solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained, together with associated energy partition factors, allowing a comprehensive assessment of interface wave characteristics. Numerical simulations carried out using MATLAB demonstrate that the reflection and transmission responses are strongly influenced by initial stress, fractional order parameter, and thermal relaxation time. The calculated energy ratios of scattered waves satisfy the energy conservation condition, confirming the mathematical consistency of the formulation. The findings of this study are relevant to the design and analysis of smart sensors, rotating and aerospace structures, vibration control systems, and energy harvesting devices employing functionally graded thermo piezoelectric materials under fractional order effects.</p>

With simple pulse sequences, we explore many-body dynamics and generate a variety of entangled states, including GHZ states, 96.7(1.7)%-fidelity Bell states, 17-qubit cluster states, and high-connectivity graph states. The versatility and scalability of QCAs offers compelling routes for scaling quantum information systems with global controls, as well as new perspectives on quantum many-body dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Vacuum structure of gapped QCD$_2$ theories from the infinite Hamiltonian lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ross Dempsey, Anna-Maria E. Glück, Silviu S. Pufu, Benjamin T. Søgaard</p>
            <p>Gapped two-dimensional gauge theories with massless fermions generically have rich vacuum structures consisting of many degenerate vacua related by the action of topological line operators. The algebra of such operators has been used to calculate ratios of vacuum expectation values of local operators and to predict nontrivial particle-soliton degeneracies. In this paper, we use recently-developed tensor network methods to study several examples of such theories via their Hamiltonian lattice descriptions. Our lattice results agree with all previously-made predictions. Furthermore, we identify the lattice strong-coupling states that can be adiabatically continued to the degenerate vacua in the continuum limit. We conjecture a procedure, referred to as a lattice decay rule, for how this identification works in general. This rule allows us to compute the continuum vacuum degeneracy by studying the lattice Hamiltonian in the strong-coupling limit.</p>

            <h2>Active learning for photonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Lopez, Charlotte Loh, Rumen Dangovski, Marin Soljačić</p>
            <p>Active learning for photonic crystals explores the integration of analytic approximate Bayesian last layer neural networks (LL-BNNs) with uncertainty-driven sample selection to accelerate photonic band gap prediction. We employ an analytic LL-BNN formulation, corresponding to the infinite Monte Carlo sample limit, to obtain uncertainty estimates that are strongly correlated with the true predictive error on unlabeled candidate structures. These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arisa Ikeda, Akitada Sakurai, Kae Nemoto, Mayu Muramatsu</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</p>

            <p>The valley degree of freedom in atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides provides a natural binary index for information processing. Exciton-polaritons formed under strong light-matter coupling offer a promising route to overcome the limited lifetime and transport of bare valley excitons. Here we report an anomalous optical valley Hall effect in a monolayer WS2 exciton-polariton system. Using polarization- and time-resolved real-space imaging, we directly visualize a symmetry-breaking spatial separation of polaritons from opposite valleys under linearly polarized excitation, accompanied by an ultrafast Hall drift velocity on the order of 10^5 m/s. This behaviour cannot be accounted for by conventional cavity-induced mechanisms and instead points to a strain-induced synthetic pseudomagnetic field acting on the excitonic component of polaritons. Our results establish exciton-polaritons as a high-speed and optically accessible platform for valley transport, opening pathways towards tunable valleytronic and topological photonic devices.</p>

            <p>In type-II superconductors, magnetic fields modulate the amplitude and phase of the superconducting order parameter, forming quantized vortices where superconductivity is locally suppressed and exotic bound states or competing electronic orders emerge. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on epitaxial Ba(Fe$_{0.94}Co$_{0.06})$_2$As$_2$ films, we discover an incommensurate charge-stripe order aligned with the Fe-Fe bond direction and nucleated inside magnetic vortices. These charge modulations intensify at the vortex core, extend far into the vortex halo, and persist within the superconducting gap. Strikingly, the charge order modulates Andreev bound states of vortices at non-zero energies, producing abelian vortices with half-odd-integer level quantization and non-abelian vortices with integer-quantized core states that host a Majorana zero mode. The distinct vortex types are distinguished by the registry of their centers relative to the charge-stripe pattern and remain robust in ultrathin (2.5-unit-cell) films. Our findings reveal a density-wave-textured vortex matter and provide fresh insights into the intertwined phenomena of charge-stripe order, pair-density-wave modulations, and Majorana physics in iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <p>Graphene enables precise carrier-density control via gating, making it an ideal platform for studying electronic interactions. However, sample inhomogeneities often limit access to the low-density regimes where these interactions dominate. Enhancing carrier mobility is therefore crucial for exploring fundamental properties and developing device applications. Here, we demonstrate a significant reduction in external inhomogeneity using a double-layer graphene architecture separated by an ultra-thin hexagonal boron nitride layer. Mutual screening between the layers reduces scattering from random Coulomb potentials, resulting in a quantum mobility exceeding. Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations emerge at magnetic fields below 1 mT, while integer quantum Hall features are observed at 0.002T. Furthermore, we identify a fractional quantum Hall plateau at a filling factor of at 2T. These results demonstrate the platform's suitability for investigating strongly correlated electronic phases in graphene-based heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Electric-Switchable Chiral Magnons in PT-Symmetric Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinyang Ni, Congzhe Yan, Peiyuan Cui, Zhijun Jiang, Yuanjun Jin, Guoqing Chang</p>
            <p>The magnons in antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs) exhibit dual chirality, each carrying opposite spin angular momentum. However, in AFIs that are protected by PT symmetry, the magnon bands remain degenerate. In this work, we introduce a new class of PT - preserving AFIs in which the giant chiral splitting of magnons can be induced and reversibly controlled by an external electric field. Unlike ordinary cases, such AFIs host a hidden dipole coupled to the antiferromagnetic order, which allows an external electric field to break the magnon sublattice symmetry and thereby largely lift the band degeneracy. Through group theory analysis, we identify the possible magnetic layer groups that support electric-field-induced magnon band splitting. Promisingly, by density-functional- theory and spin wave calculations, the magnon band splitting of Cr2CBr2 reach up to 27meV induced by an electric field of 0.2V/Å, equivalent to the 230T under a uniform magnetic field. In addition, since chiral splitting is directly coupled to the electric field, the corresponding magnon-mediated spin current can be switched by the electric field. Our Letter opens a door for developing electric-field-controlled spintronics based on the magnons.</p>

            <h2>Facile Optimization of Combinatorial Sputtering Processes with Arbitrary Numbers of Components for Targeted Compositions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shelby Sutton Fields, Christopher David White, Keith Knipling, Steven Bennett</p>
            <p>Combinatorial sputtering is a physical vapor deposition method that enables the high-throughput synthesis of compositionally varied thin films. Using this technique, the effects of stoichiometry on specific properties of alloy thin films with analog composition gradients can be mapped using high-throughput characterization. To obtain specific stoichiometries, such as those desired for an equiatomic, intermetallic, or doped compounds, the sputter power of each target must be simultaneously tuned to optimize the deposition rate of each component. This optimization problem increases in complexity with the number of components, which commonly leads to iterative guess-and-check processing and can limit the intrinsic high-throughput advantages of this synthesis method. To circumvent this challenge, this work introduces a composition optimization procedure that enables the facile synthesis of sputtered combinatorial films with targeted compositions. This procedure leverages the expeditious mapping of composition using wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence and is capable of optimizing processing for an arbitrary number of components. As a demonstration, this method is leveraged to sputter a combinatorial Cr$_{v}$Fe$_{w}$Mo$_{x}$Nb$_{y}$Ta$_{z}$ film with an equiatomic composition near the wafer center.</p>

Using exact Dirac eigenstates in cylindrical confinement, we demonstrate that this helical structure possesses definite handedness, persists into evanescent regions, and is characterized by a geometric helix pitch independent of the longitudinal de~Broglie wavelength. This intrinsic helical geometry enables a local geometric coupling between a propagating electron and a chiral environment, yielding chirality--dependent spin selectivity through current geometry rather than through a spin--orbit coupling term.</p>

            <p>We report a detailed investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and dielectric properties of polycrystalline LaV$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_4$ samples, prepared at two sintering temperatures (1000\degree C and 1250\degree C). The introduction of Nb$^{5+}$ at the V$^{5+}$ site leads to notable structural and vibrational changes, which can be attributed to their isoelectronic nature and the comparatively larger ionic radius of Nb$^{5+}$. The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns confirms a coexistence of monoclinic ($P$2$_{1}$/$n$) and scheelite-type tetragonal ($I$4$_{1}$/$a$) phases; for example, with a fraction of 4\% and 96\% for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C. The particle morphology has altered from spherical (1000\degree C) to irregular-shaped (1250\degree C) as a result of increase in annealing temperature. The Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy have been used to understand the vibrational and electronic properties. An optical band gap of 2.7~eV for the sample sintered at 1250\degree C is calculated using Ultraviolet-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The dielectric studies shows the higher dielectric permittivity ($\epsilon$$_{r}$) and lower dielectric loss for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C.</p>

            <p>To achieve room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new FMI phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our study reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Excitons and their correlated complexes underpin the rich photophysics of quantum-confined semiconductors. Among these, biexcitons -- bound states of two electrons and two holes -- provide a sensitive probe of Coulomb correlations, exciton-exciton interactions, and the role of the dielectric environment. In Ruddlesden-Popper metal halide materials (RPMHs), strong quantum and dielectric confinement stabilize excitons with binding energies of hundreds of meV, creating an ideal platform for multi-exciton phenomena. Conventional linear spectroscopies, such as photoluminescence and transient absorption, reveal biexciton signatures but suffer from spectral congestion and reabsorption artifacts. Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopies, particularly two-quantum (2Q) multidimensional techniques, uniquely access multi-exciton coherences and provide unambiguous estimates of biexciton binding energies. This minireview surveys the spectroscopic evidence for biexcitons in RPMHs, highlights the advantages of nonlinear multidimensional approaches, and situates biexciton physics within the broader context of excitonic materials, including GaAs quantum wells, quantum dots, and transition-metal dichalcogenides. By emphasizing the interplay of exciton-exciton annihilation, excitation-induced dephasing, and biexciton formation, we argue that multidimensional coherent spectroscopy offers the most reliable pathway to disentangle many-body interactions in quantum-well derivatives of metal-halide perovskites.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prashant Singh, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai</p>
            <p>We investigate the splitting probability of a monitored continuous-time quantum walk with two targets and show that, in stark contrast to a classical random walk, it exhibits a nonanalytic, phase-transition-like behavior controlled by the sampling time at the targets. For large systems and sampling times smaller than a critical value $\tau_c = 2\pi/\Delta E$, where $\Delta E$ is the energy bandwidth, the splitting probability is universal and equal to $1/2$, independent of the initial condition and the sampling time. Above the critical sampling, a nonuniversal regime emerges in which the splitting probability deviates from $1/2$ and develops a fluctuating pattern of pronounced peaks and dips dependent on both the sampling time and the initial condition. These results follow from a nontrivial mapping of the splitting problem onto a pair of single-target detection problems enabled by the superposition principle.</p>

            <h2>Langevin equations with non-Gaussian thermal noise: Valid but superfluous</h2>

            <p>We discuss the statistics of additive thermal (internal) noise in systems governed by the generalized Langevin equation with linear dissipation. To assess the equation's validity, it is common to assume that the system is ergodic and to verify that solutions approach correct equilibrium values at asymptotically long times. In this paper, we instead consider the consistency of the generalized Langevin equation with the Jarzynski equality at finite times and do not assume the system's ergodicity. Specifically, we consider a classical Brownian oscillator whose initial stiffness, or frequency, is perturbed by a rectangular pulse of duration $\tau$. We find that the Jarzynski equality is satisfied unconditionally only up to the seventh order in $\tau$; in higher orders, the Jarzynski equality holds if and only if the noise is Gaussian. These results imply that, unless it is exact, the Langevin equation can only be used to evaluate properties that are linear or quadratic in noise and its derivatives. Such properties are insensitive to the noise statistics, so the Langevin equation with linear dissipation and non-Gaussian noise (though not inconsistent by itself) is superfluous.</p>

            <p>In this work, we combine coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations and mean-field theory to study supercoiling dynamics, as well as the steady-state profiles of twist and writhe, in an open DNA polymer where one of the free ends is subjected to a constant torque. Even though the other end is free, and hence can spin and release torsional stress, we observe that the entire chain transitions between a swollen and a plectonemic phase as the torque increases beyond a critical threshold. In the plectonemic phase, we observe a non-linear twist profile in the steady state, resulting from the mutual interconversion between the injected twist and geometrical writhe, which distributes inhomogeneously along the chain. We also show that the non-equilibrium dynamics of twist accumulation is diffusive, and that writhe diffusion is negligible in this geometry, as plectonemes remain localised near the end that is being rotated. We discuss the feasibility of testing our results with single-molecule experiments.</p>

            <p>Consistent with prior qualitative expectations for group IV-VI topological crystalline insulators, this work demonstrates, based on band structure and Chern number calculations, that Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se/(PbSe)$_{1-y}$(EuS)$_y$ quantum wells constitute a promising and viable platform for realizing a variety of quantum anomalous Hall phases. The proposed basis transformation procedure for the multiband $\mathit{k} \cdot \mathit{p}$ Hamiltonian enables the treatment of wells grown along arbitrary crystallographic directions while explicitly accounting for the anisotropy of the material's isoenergetic surfaces. Numerical studies of $\langle 111\rangle$-, $\langle 110\rangle$- and $\langle 001\rangle$-oriented quantum wells predict attainable Chern numbers with magnitudes ranging from $1$ to $4$, depending on the quantum well width, Sn content, and relative orientation of the four projected $\mathrm{L}$ valleys with respect to the growth direction.

            <p>Strongly-correlated fermion systems on a lattice have been a subject of intense focus in the field of condensed-matter physics. These systems are notoriously difficult to solve, even with state-of-the-art numerical methods, especially in regimes of parameters where degrees of freedom compete or cooperate at similar energy and length scales. Here, we introduce a spin-1 slave-particle technique to approximately treat the t-U-V-J fermionic model at arbitrary electron dopings in an economical manner. This formalism respectively maps the original charge and spin degrees of freedom into effective pseudo-spin and pseudo-fermion sectors, which are treated using a self-consistent cluster mean-field method. We study the phase diagram of the model under various conditions and report the appearance of charge and spin stripes within this formalism. These stripes are a consequence of the cluster mean-field treatment of the pseudo-particle sectors and have not been detected in previous slave-particle studies. The results obtained agree qualitatively well with what more reliable numerical methods capture.</p>

            <h2>A saturation bound for cumulative responses under local linear relaxation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjeev Kumar Verma</p>
            <p>Saturation of cumulative observables is widely observed in systems with propagating or spreading signals and is commonly modeled using system-specific mechanisms such as scattering statistics, coherence functions, or phenomenological decay laws. This work shows that such saturation follows directly from linear local relaxation alone. Any linear observable accumulated over the lifetime of a relaxing signal is bounded by a scale set by the relaxation time, independent of geometry, dimensionality, or microscopic dynamics. When relaxation is mapped to space through transport or spreading, this temporal bound yields a corresponding spatial saturation scale. A closed-form expression reveals a two-regime behavior: linear growth at short times followed by saturation beyond the relaxation time. The result provides a minimal and unified explanation for cumulative saturation across transport, diffusive, and stochastic systems.</p>

Large amplitude of the predicted effect may compensate for the smallness of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, making the equilibrium spin currents to be experimentally observed. We suggest that external electric field can play the role of effective flux magnons interact with and propose an experiment based on the interference of magnons in the ring geometry as a verification of the concept.</p>

            <p>Fluctuations are an intrinsic feature of many-body systems, and their full statistical distributions reveal a wealth of information about the underlying physics. Of particular interest are non-Gaussian, extreme-value statistics that arise when nontrivial correlations and criticality dominate over the central limit theorem. Strikingly, in two-dimensional (2D) quantum fluids, such effects have been predicted to manifest in the order parameter distribution in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) superfluid phase, which approaches a universal extreme-value form in the low-temperature limit. Here, we measure the order parameter statistics of 2D Bose gases across the BKT critical point using matter-wave interferometry. This allows us to confirm the predicted convergence of the observed statistics to a universal Gumbel distribution at low temperatures, to the 0.1% level of the probability density. Furthermore, the intrinsic precision of the atom interferometer allows the robust extraction of higher-moment observables such as skewness and kurtosis; in particular, we report direct measurements of the Binder cumulant which allows us to precisely identify the onset of the phase transition. Extending this approach to the investigation of non-equilibrium systems, we probe vortex unbinding dynamics following a quench across the BKT critical point and identify parameter-independent scaling behaviour of higher moments.</p>

            <p>Error mitigation (EM) methods are crucial for obtaining reliable results in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, where noise significantly impacts output accuracy. Some EM protocols are particularly efficient for specific types of noise. Yet the noise in the actual hardware may not align with that. In this article, we introduce Noise Tailoring (NT) -- an innovative strategy designed to modify the structure of the noise associated with two-qubit gates through statistical sampling. We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates. At the same time, on actual IBM quantum computers, the NT method falls victim to various small error sources beyond Markovian Pauli noise. We propose to use the NT method for characterizing such error sources on quantum computers in order to inform hardware development.</p>

            <h2>Cost scaling of MPS and TTNS simulations for 2D and 3D systems with area-law entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Barthel</p>
            <p>Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D>1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.</p>

            <h2>Bayesian identification of fibrous insulation thermal conductivity towards design of spacecraft thermal protection systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Alberts, Akshay Jacob Thomas, Kamran Daryabeigi, Ilias Bilionis</p>
            <p>The design of spacecraft thermal protection systems (TPS) requires accurate knowledge of thermal transport properties across wide ranges of temperature and pressure. For fibrous insulation, conventional measurement techniques in laboratory settings are typically limited to temperatures much lower than what is reached in atmosphere entry scenarios. Moreover, it is often the case that only temperature measurements are available, meaning that the thermal conductivity of the insulation must be indirectly inferred as an inverse problem. We propose a Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) to reconstruct the thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse experimental data. Under IFT, the conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, and the physics is enforced via a physics-informed prior over the temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces an infinite-dimensional posterior distribution that quantifies uncertainty about the conductivity which can be evaluated in extrapolation regimes. We apply the method to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with both synthetic and experimental data to reconstruct the thermal conductivity beyond the experimental regime. The inferred conductivities are validated against reference data and then propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories. The results show that IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust TPS sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement.</p>

            <h2>Dissipative Quantum Dynamics in Static Network with Different Topologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Yang Liu, Hsuan-Wei Lee</p>
            <p>We investigate the dissipative dynamics of quantum population and coherence among different network topologies of a quantum network using a quantum spin model coupled to a thermal bosonic reservoir. Our study proceeds in two parts. First, we analyze a small network of Ising spins embedded in a large dissipative bath, modeled via the Lindblad master equation, where temperature arises naturally from system-bath coupling. This approach reveals how network topology shapes quantum dissipative dynamics, providing a basis for controlling quantum coherence through tailored network structures. Second, we propose a mean-field approach that extends the network to larger scales and captures dissipative dynamics in large-scale networks, connecting network topology to quantum coherence in complex systems and revealing the sensitivity of quantum coherence to network structure. Our results highlight how dissipative quantum dynamics depend on network topology, providing insight into the coherent dynamics of entangled states in networks. These results may be extended to dynamics in complex systems such as opinion propagation in social models, epidemiology, and various condensed-phase and biological systems.</p>

            <h2>Interaction between cell membranes and protein inclusions in the large-deformation regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaetano Ferraro, Michele Castellana</p>
            <p>Biological membranes are dynamic surfaces whose shape and function are critically influenced by protein inclusions (PIs). While membrane deformations induced by PIs have been extensively studied in the small-deformation regime, a variety of processes involves strong membrane deformations. We investigate the interaction between lipid membranes and PIs in the large deformation (LD) regime, with the finite-element method. We develop an approximate analytical solution that captures key features of the LD regime. We show that the force exerted by the membrane on a PI displays a non-monotonic behavior with respect to the PI vertical displacement. The qualitative features of this force appear to be independent of the protein geometry. For two interacting PIs, the membrane-mediated potential exhibits sub-power-law decay with inter-protein distance, reflecting the complex nature of the elastic medium. The interaction potential shows that conical PIs with identical and opposite orientations repel and attract, respectively, confirming the analogy between PI orientation and electric charge, in the LD regime. In the presence of membrane flows, we identify a characteristic velocity that separates two regimes in which bending rigidity and viscous effects dominate, respectively, implying the onset of flow-induced deformations above such velocity threshold. Overall, our results provide quantitative predictions for membrane-protein systems in biologically relevant scenarios involving LDs, with implications for protein sorting, clustering, and membrane trafficking.</p>

            <p>Surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) resonators operating at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies are widely used in wireless telecommunication and quantum information processing. Successful implementation of such resonators calls for detailed microscopic understanding of their mode profiles, energy dissipation channels, and imperfections from microfabrication. In this work, we report on the visualization of acoustic waves in LiNbO3 SAW resonators by transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy (TMIM). The Gaussian mode profile tightly confined by reflecting mirrors is vividly seen in the TMIM images, from which the linewidth of the resonator itself can be extracted. The spatially resolved acoustic profile also allows us to perform failure analysis on faulty devices. Our work establishes a pathway for further optimization of SAW resonators for classical and quantum acoustic applications.</p>

            <p>We show that quantum information scrambling can enable a generic SWAP gate between collective degrees of freedom in systems without universal local control. Our protocol combines the Hayden-Preskill recovery scheme, associated with the black hole information paradox, with quantum teleportation and runs them in parallel and in opposite directions, enabling bidirectional exchange of quantum states through global interactions alone. This approach cleanly distinguishes the roles of information spreading, entanglement, and chaos for enabling both coherent state transfer and recovery. We propose an experimental realization using the Dicke model, which can be realized in cavity-QED and trapped-ion platforms, highlighting the utility of holography in designing practical quantum gates.</p>

Here, we build an ultrafast diamond nonlinear photonic sensor to assess the surface electric field; an electro-optic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond nanotip breaks the spatial-limit of conventional pump-probe techniques. The 10-fs near-infrared optical pulse modulates the surface electric field of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide and we monitor the dynamics of the local electric field at nanometer-femtosecond spatio-temporal resolutions.

            <p>Transitions from bound states in the continuum (BICs) to quasi-BICs (qBICs) are typically realized by introducing in-plane asymmetry, including permittivity asymmetry ({\epsilon}-qBICs) and geometry asymmetry (g-qBICs). Here, we demonstrate that when the in-plane symmetry is rigorously kept, the transition can also be occurred, provided the out-of-plane asymmetry is designed, which is called {\sigma}h -qBICs in this work. When the {{\sigma}h symmetry is gradually broken, the system undergoes a topological phase transition characterized by a Zak phase inversion, leading to a band inversion between quadrupole and dipole modes. This process not only enables controlled radiation coupling of BICs but also introduces a defect-immune qBIC regime. Our findings establish a general mechanism for engineering high-Q resonances and topologically robust plasmonic cavities.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of antiferromagnetic Dimers in Rydberg Atom Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Yuan Kuang, Lin Li, Weibin Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers within a Rydberg atom chain in the regime where laser detuning compensates for nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. Using an effective PXQ model, we demonstrate that the associated Hilbert space decomposes into disconnected, dimer-conserving subspaces. The classification of these subspaces is provided, and the computational basis states spanning them are identified. Through a combination of analytical mapping and numerical simulations, we compare the dynamics of the PXQ model with those of the full Rydberg atom chain. The deviations are attributed to two factors, laser-induced leakage from the constrained Hilbert subspace and the influence of long-range interactions beyond the NN limit. Our results indicate that subspace leakage can be mitigated by increasing the NN interaction strength. While this simultaneously amplifies the effects of long-range interactions, the conservation of the dimer number remains. Our study opens up possibilities for exploring the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers using the Rydberg atom quantum simulator.</p>

            <h2>Size-dependent Dielectric Permittivity of Perovskite Nanocrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jehyeok Ryu, Victor Krivenkov, Vitaly Goryashko, Yury Rakovich, Alexey Y. Nikitin</p>
            <p>Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising building blocks for quantum photonic devices. Optical properties of PNCs can be enhanced by integration with optical cavities or nanoantennas. Designing such structures requires accurate size dependent dielectric permittivity of PNCs. However, current reports provide primarily ensemble averaged values with limited access to the intrinsic response of individual PNCs. Here we suggest a methodology to reconstruct the size dependent complex dielectric permittivity of CsPbBr3 PNCs from the measured absorbance spectrum of colloidal solution. The permittivity of PNCs is modeled as a sum of Voigt profile oscillators, with the size dependent transition energies governed by the exciton effective mass. Using a transmission electron microscopy derived size distribution of the PNCs, the solution permittivity is obtained via Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. This permittivity is used in a transfer matrix method to simulate and fit the absorbance spectrum, from which the permittivity of PNCs is reconstructed. The extracted spectral linewidth from the imaginary part of the permittivity (78.4 meV) is consistent with single nanocrystal emission linewidths at room temperature. Finite element simulations show enhanced absorption cross section of a single PNC coupled to a nanoantenna, demonstrating applicability of the extracted permittivity. More generally, these findings provide a route to extract intrinsic permittivity of individual nanocrystals from absorbance measurements of their ensembles.</p>

            <p>The maximum work extractable from a quantum system is achieved when the system is driven adiabatically. Frictional work then quantifies the difference in work output between adiabatic and non-adiabatic driving. Here we show that frictional work in a non-integrable spin chain is well-described by the diagonal entropy production associated with the build up of quantum coherence. The relationship is characterized by an effective temperature of the final adiabatic state and holds for slow to moderate driving protocols. For fast protocols, the frictional work is instead described by the quantum relative entropy between the final non-adiabatic and adiabatic states. We compare our results to those obtained from an integrable spin chain, in which case the adiabatic state is no longer described by a single temperature. In this case, the frictional work is described by a sum of terms for each independent subspace of the spin chain, which are at different effective temperatures. We show how integrability breaking can enhance work extraction in the adiabatic limit, but degrade work extraction in sufficiently non-adiabatic regimes.</p>

            <h2>Partitioning networks into clusters of synchronized nodes via the message-passing algorithm: an unbiased scalable approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Massimo Ostilli</p>
            <p>Partitioning large networks into stable clusters of synchronized nodes is a challenging task. Recent approaches based on spectral analysis can provide exact results on specific dynamics but remain unfeasible for very large networks. Moreover, within a stochastic framework, it is unclear which dynamics should be chosen to study synchronization. Here we propose an unbiased and scalable method based on the message-passing algorithm. By exploiting the collective behavior emerging across critical points of an effective Ising-like model, we identify dynamically coherent clusters of synchronized nodes and illustrate the approach on some large real-world networks. We find that, unlike continuous-time dynamics, abrupt desyncrhronization occurs even in simple graphs, without the need to invoke higher order interactions. However, when noise is included, the transition to synchronization becomes smoother and proceeds through the formation of plateaus, albeit at the cost of requiring larger coupling strengths.</p>

            <p>For a few decades, Fluorescent Molecular Rotors have been commonly employed as local probes of microviscosity in complex materials. However, without proper calibration, relating microviscosity to a physical parameter is unclear, which strongly limits their quantitative use in biological media for instance. In this study, the response of a molecular rotor in binary and ternary macromolecular aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights is investigated in order to better rationalize the sensitivity of rotors to their cybotactic environment. More precisely, for the investigated composition range of ternary mixtures, it is shown that a linear mixing rule applies for fluorescence lifetime with the proportion of the two PEG, and with an increasing ratio of heavy PEG leading to larger lifetimes. These results allow to test more precisely the free volume theory, which has been proposed in the context of probing glass transition. Analysis show that while this theory semi-quantitatively captures the observation, its precise use raises some questions.</p>

In this paper, we propose a universal method of digitized counterdiabatic driving, constructing the adiabatic gauge potential in a digital way with the idea of universal counterdiabatic driving. This method has three advantages over existing universal counterdiabatic driving and/or digitized counterdiabatic driving: it does not introduce any many-body and/or nonlocal interactions to an original target Hamiltonian; it can incorporate infinite nested commutators, which constitute the adiabatic gauge potential; and it gives explicit expression of rotation angles for digital implementation. We show the consistency of our method to the exact theory in an analytical way and the effectiveness of our method with the aid of numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are ubiquitous in time-series modelling, with applications ranging from chemical reaction modelling to speech recognition. These HMMs are often large, with high-dimensional memories. A recently-proposed application of quantum technologies is to execute quantum analogues of HMMs. Such quantum HMMs (QHMMs) are strictly more expressive than their classical counterparts, enabling the construction of more parsimonious models of stochastic processes. However, state-of-the-art techniques for QHMM compression, based on tensor networks, are only applicable for a restricted subset of HMMs, where the transitions are deterministic. In this work we introduce a pipeline by which \emph{any} finite, ergodic HMM can be compressed in this manner, providing a route for effective quantum dimension reduction of general HMMs. We demonstrate the method on both a simple toy model, and on a speech-derived HMM trained from data, obtaining favourable memory--accuracy trade-offs compared to classical compression approaches.</p>

            <p>In combinatorial optimization problems with degenerate ground states, fair sampling of degenerate solutions is essential. However, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with a standard transverse-field mixer induces biases among degenerate states as circuit depth increases. Based on quantum-classical correspondence theory, we propose SBO-QAOA, which employs a temperature-dependent Hamiltonian encoding a Gibbs distribution as its ground state. Numerical simulations show that, unlike standard QAOA, SBO-QAOA yields ground-state probabilities converging to finite-temperature values with uniform distribution among degenerate states. These fairness and temperature-targeting properties are preserved even with only four variational parameters under a linear schedule.</p>

            <p>At the heart of quark confinement and hadronization, the physics of flux strings has recently become a focal point in the field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP). Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges. Finally, we provide efficient qudit circuits for a quantum simulation experiment in which our results can be observed in state-of-the-art ion-trap setups. Our findings lay the groundwork for quantum simulations of flux strings towards the quantum field theory limit.</p>

            <p>Understanding how to analyze highly entangled thermal eigenstates is a central challenge in the study of quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we introduce a stabilizer-based approach to construct analytically tractable energy eigenstates of nonintegrable many-body Hamiltonians. Focusing on zero-energy eigenstates at infinite temperature, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy $k$-body microscopic thermal equilibrium for any $k\ge4$. We further show that this bound is tight by explicitly constructing two-body nonintegrable Hamiltonians whose stabilizer eigenstates reproduce thermal expectation values for all two-body and all three-body observables. Finally, we identify the structural origin of this limitation by characterizing the conditions under which a stabilizer state can appear as a zero-energy eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, thereby revealing a fundamental constraint imposed by the few-body nature of interactions.</p>

            <h2>Studying energy-resolved transport with wavepacket dynamics on quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melody Lee, Roland C. Farrell</p>
            <p>Probing energy-dependent transport in quantum simulators requires preparing states with tunable energy and small energy variance. Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport properties with improved energy resolution. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we prepare and evolve wavepackets on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and identify an energy-dependent localization transition in the Anderson model on an 8x7 lattice--a finite-size mobility edge. We observe that a wavepacket initialized at low energy remains spatially localized under time evolution, while a high-energy wavepacket delocalizes, consistent with the presence of a mobility edge. Crucial to our experiments is an error mitigation strategy that infers the noiseless output bit string distribution using maximum-likelihood estimation. Compared to post-selection, this method removes systematic errors and reduces statistical uncertainty by up to a factor of 5. We extend our methods to the many-particle regime by developing a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional model of interacting fermions. This technique has modest quantum resource requirements, making wavepacket-based studies of transport in many-body systems a promising application for near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Political moderation, a key attractor in democratic systems, proves highly fragile under realistic information conditions. We develop a stochastic model of opinion dynamics to analyze how noise and differential susceptibility reshape the political spectrum. Extending Marvel et al.'s deterministic framework, we incorporate stochastic media influence $\zeta(t)$ and neuropolitically-grounded sensitivity differences ($\sigma_y > \sigma_x$). Analysis reveals the moderate population -- stable in deterministic models -- undergoes catastrophic collapse under stochastic forcing. This occurs through an effective deradicalization asymmetry ($u_{B}^{\text{eff}} = u + \sigma_y^2/2 > u_{A}^{\text{eff}}$) that drives conservatives to extinction, eliminating cross-cutting interactions that sustain moderates. The system exhibits a phase transition from multi-stable coexistence to liberal dominance, demonstrating how information flow architecture -- independent of content -- systematically dismantles the political center. Our findings reveal moderation as an emergent property highly vulnerable to stochastic perturbations in complex social systems.</p>
