            <h2>Detecting half-quantum superconducting vortices by spin-qubit relaxometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gábor B. Halász, Nirjhar Sarkar, Yueh-Chun Wu, Joshua T. Damron, Chengyun Hua, Benjamin Lawrie</p>
            <p>Half-quantum vortices in spin-triplet superconductors are predicted to harbor Majorana zero modes and may provide a viable avenue to topological quantum computation. Here, we introduce a novel approach for directly measuring the half-integer-quantized magnetic fluxes, $\Phi = h / (4e)$, carried by such half-quantum vortices via spin-qubit relaxometry. We consider a superconducting strip with a narrow pinch point at which vortices cross quasi-periodically below a spin qubit as a result of a bias current. We demonstrate that the relaxation rate of the spin qubit exhibits a pronounced peak if the vortex-crossing frequency matches the transition frequency of the spin qubit and conclude that the magnetic flux $\Phi$ of a single vortex can be obtained by dividing the corresponding voltage along the strip with the transition frequency. We discuss experimental constraints on implementing our proposed setup in spin-triplet candidate materials like UTe$_2$, UPt$_3$, and URhGe.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-geometry-enabled Landau-Zener tunneling in singular flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanyu Long, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>Flat-band materials have attracted substantial interest for their intriguing quantum geometric effects. Here we investigate how singular flat bands (SFBs) respond to a static, uniform electric field and whether they can support single-particle dc transport. By constructing a minimal two-band lattice model, we show that away from the singular band crossing point (BCP), the Wannier-Stark (WS) spectrum of the flat band is well captured by an intraband Berry phase $\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}$. The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport. In contrast, near the BCP the interband Berry connection becomes prominent and drives Landau-Zener tunneling, which bends the flat-band WS ladder and delocalizes the SFB wavefunctions. Remarkably, this regime is governed solely by the maximal quantum distance $d$ through two geometric phases $(\theta,\varphi)$: $\theta$ characterizes the tunneling rate and $\varphi$ acts as a generalized Berry phase. These results highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in enabling nontrivial transport signatures in SFBs.</p>

            <h2>Quantum capacitance and parity switching of a quantum-dot-based Kitaev chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Xiao Liu</p>
            <p>An array of quantum dots coupled via superconductivity provides a new platform for creating Kitaev chains with Majorana zero modes, offering a promising avenue toward topological quantum computing. In this work, we theoretically study the quantum capacitance of a minimal Kitaev chain weakly coupled to an external normal lead. We find that in the open regime, charge stability diagrams of quantum capcaitance can help to identify the sweet spot of a Kitaev chain, consistent with tunnel spectroscopy. Moreover, the quantum capacitance of a single quantum dot coupled to Andreev bound states reveals the interplay between two distinct parity switching mechanisms: coupling to an external normal lead and intrinsic quasiparticle poisoning. Our work provides useful physical insights into the quantum capacitance and parity dynamics in a quantum-dot-based Kitaev chain device.</p>

            <h2>Topological-transition-driven Giant Enhancement of Second-harmonic Generation in Ferroelectric Bismuth Monolayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Zheng Chen, Hongjun Xiang, Yusheng Hou</p>
            <p>The interplay between band topology and light in condensed materials could unlock intriguing nonlinear optical phenomena, enabling modern photonic technologies such as quantum light sources and sub-wavelength topological lasers. Here, we unveil that a buckling-tuned topological transition in ferroelectric bismuth monolayer unleashes a giant second-harmonic generation. Using first-principles calculations, we surprisingly find that ferroelectric bismuth monolayer with a buckling parameter, $\Delta h$, has a large susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ on the order of $10^{7}$ $\mathrm{pm}^2/\mathrm{V}$, exceeding monolayer MoS$_2$ by about two orders of magnitude. When $\Delta h$ is engineered to the critical window where Dirac electrons emerge, a low-frequency resonance appears, boosting $\chi^{(2)}$ by an additional order of magnitude. We show that this enhancement is localized on the Dirac cones and dominated by intraband modification contributions. Based on an extended Dirac model, we establish that this enhancement physically originates from the ultralight effective masses $m^{*}$ of Dirac electrons through scaling with the Fermi velocity $v_F$ and band gap $E_g$. Our findings provide a general paradigm for achieving exceptional second-harmonic generation via engineering topological criticality, and could serve as an experimental signature of Dirac electrons in topological materials.</p>

            <h2>Stripe antiferromagnetism and chiral superconductivity in tWSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erekle Jmukhadze, Sam Olin, Allan H. MacDonald, Wei-Cheng Lee</p>
            <p>The layer-dependent Hamiltonians of parallel-stacked MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayer moiré materials are topologically non-trivial, both in real space and in momentum space, and have been shown to support integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, as well as antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moiré band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $\theta=2.7^\circ$ and $\theta=3.65^\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state.</p>

            <h2>Field induced superconductivity in a magnetically doped two-dimensional crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Llanos, Veronica Show, Reiley Dorrian, Joseph Falson</p>
            <p>Magnetic field induced superconductivity is a rare property in nature due to the sensitivity of spin-singlet Cooper pairing to time-reversal symmetry breaking perturbations. However, in rare cases, an interplay between magnetic fields and ions can be engineered to bring about superconductivity at finite fields. Here we use ultra-thin LaSb$_2$ doped with dilute Ce paramagnetic impurities to demonstrate a magnetic field-induced superconducting dome in a two-dimensional crystal. The reduced dimensionality of the structure enables the use of an in-plane magnetic field to dynamically suppress spin fluctuations on the Ce-site, which leads to an anomalous enhancement of the critical temperature with increasing field. By modelling the spin scattering dynamics across the experimental parameter space, we reveal insight into the complex nature of paramagnetic impurities in magnetic fields at low temperature, and how their manipulation can result in the ability to tune between competing magnetic pair-breaking regimes. Realizing this physics in a two-dimensional crystalline setting invites the application of similar approaches to unconventional forms of superconductivity while also highlighting new experimental standards which should be employed when studying ultra-thin materials in general.</p>

            <h2>The superradiant phase is a finite size effect in two-photon processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Ramírez, David Villaseñor, Nahum Vázquez, Jorge G. Hirsch</p>
            <p>Two-photon light-matter interactions exhibit distinctive features such as spectral collapse. The two-photon Dicke model has been reported to exhibit a superradiant phase which could be useful in quantum applications. Here we show that this superradiant phase is not a genuine thermodynamic phase but a finite-size effect. Combining analytical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the superradiant region shrinks with increasing system size and disappears in the thermodynamic limit, while spectral collapse remains. Our results clarify the nature of superradiant conditions in two-photon systems and constrain its realization in quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Chern insulator with higher Chern number in optical lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Xing Ding, Wen-Tong Li, Li-Min Zhang, Yu-Biao Wu, Duanlu Zhou, Lin Zhuang, Wu-Ming Liu</p>
            <p>Fractional Chern insulators arise in topologically nontrivial flat bands, characterized by an integer Chern number C that corresponds to the number of dissipationless edge states in the non-interacting regime. Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice. Our work provides a general and widely applicable strategy for constructing higher Chern number flat bands, opening a pathway to explore exotic fractional quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Spin Response of a Magnetic Monopole and Quantum Hall Response in Topological Lattice Models through Local Invariants and Light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karyn Le Hur, Andrea Baldanza</p>
            <p>Here, we elaborate on and develop the geometrical approach introduced in K. Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions. We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. it remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light. We develop the formalism for coupled-planes materials including the possibility of quantum spin Hall effect and address a relation between the Ramanujan infinite alternating series and an interface in real space with a topological number one-half.</p>

            <h2>Creation of ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Jia, Zhichao Guo, Zerong Huang, Dajun Wang</p>
            <p>We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</p>

            <h2>Jordan-Wigner mapping between quantum-spin and fermionic Casimir effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katsumasa Nakayama, Kei Suzuki</p>
            <p>The Jordan-Wigner transformation connects spin operators in one-dimensional spin systems and fermionic operators. In this work, we elucidate the relationship between the finite-size corrections in the spin representation and the fermionic Casimir effect in the corresponding fermion representation. In particular, we focus on the ground-state energy of one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models, and show that all finite-size corrections can be interpreted as lattice fermionic Casimir effects. We further find several types of Casimir phenomena, such as the conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping behavior from massive fields, vanishing behavior from flat or nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from the finite-density effect. Our findings establish a dictionary between finite-size corrections in spin chains and fermionic Casimir effects, and provide experimentally relevant platforms for the fermionic Casimir phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Cooper Condensation and Pair Wave Functions in Strongly Correlated Electrons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannes Karlsson, Johannes S. Hofmann, Alexander Wietek</p>
            <p>Identifying superconducting states of matter without prior assumptions is a central challenge in strongly correlated electron systems. We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Dissipative diffusion in quantum state preparation: from passive cooling to system-bath engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Pokart, Lukas König, Sebastian Diehl, Jan Carl Budich</p>
            <p>We investigate and compare two particle number conserving protocols for the preparation of a topologically nontrivial state. The first is derived from thermally coupling the system to a cold bath, while the second is based on engineered dissipation. We numerically study the time required to reach the target state as well as its robustness against physically important perturbations. Crucially, in both protocols the cooling capability is limited by dissipatively induced diffusion processes. The resulting quadratic scaling of the cooling time with system size is corroborated also analytically using mean-field approximations and a purely classical random walk model. Furthermore, we find that the engineered protocol admits a unique and stable dark state, which contributes to an ongoing discussion regarding the applicability of dissipative state preparation to many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cooper Finnigan, Mehdi Kagarian, Dmitry K. Efimkin</p>
            <p>We study the formation of hybrid plasmon-magnon modes in a heterostructure comprising a monolayer semiconductor with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling -- specifically, Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) -- and an insulating ferrimagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet-based compounds. Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.</p>

            <h2>Frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function of IDTBT single-molecule fluorescence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quanwei Li, Yuping Shi, Lam Lam, K. Birgitta Whaley, Graham Fleming</p>
            <p>The frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function (g(2)({\tau})) of single-molecule fluorescence has recently been proposed as a powerful new quantum light spectroscopy that can reveal intrinsic quantum coherence in excitation energy transfer in molecular systems ranging from simple dimers to photosynthetic complexes. Yet, no experiments have been reported to date. Here, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence g(2)({\tau}) quantum light spectroscopy (SMFg2-QLS) that can simultaneously measure the fluorescence intensity, lifetime, spectra, and g(2)({\tau}) with frequency resolution, for a single molecule in a controlled environment at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature. As a proof of principle, we have studied single molecules of IDTBT (indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole), a semiconducting donor-acceptor conjugated copolymer with a chain-like structure that shows a high carrier mobility and annihilation-limited long-range exciton transport. We have observed different g(2)({\tau}=0) values with different bands or bandwidths of the single molecule IDTBT fluorescence. The general features are consistent with theoretical predictions and suggest non-trivial excited state quantum dynamics, possibly showing quantum coherence, although further analysis and confirmation will require additional theoretical calculations that take into account the complexity and inhomogeneity of individual IDTBT single molecular chains. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of frequency- and time-resolved SMFg2-QLS to provide new insights into molecular quantum dynamics and to reveal signatures of intrinsic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light harvesting that are independent of the nature of the light excitation.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental Tests of Quantum Geometric Bounds in Ionic and Covalent Insulators using Inelastic X-Ray Scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Bałut, Barry Bradlyn, Marcus D. Collins, Peter Abbamonte</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry underlies many fundamental properties of materials, but it has remained largely inaccessible to direct experiment. Here we demonstrate that inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) provides a direct, quantitative probe of quantum geometry and quantum information in solids. Studying two prototype insulators, covalently bonded diamond and ionically bonded LiF, we measure the density response and experimentally determine the quantum Fisher information, the associated Bures metric, and the electron localization length. These measurements enable a quantitative comparison of quantum geometry for two distinct bonding environments. We find that the dimensionless quantum weight, $aK(q)$, which quantifies the longitudinal localization of quantum information, is constrained by fundamental electrostatic bounds in both materials. Crucially, the quantum weight of diamond exceeds that of LiF, indicating that covalent bonds exhibit a higher degree of delocalization and higher density of quantum information than the ionic bonds. Our results establish a direct experimental relationship between quantum information, electron localization, and chemical bonding, and identify IXS as a powerful tool for measuring quantum geometry in materials.</p>

            <p>Landau polaritons arising from the coupling between cyclotron resonance and terahertz split-ring resonators (SRRs) have served as a central platform for exploring ultrastrong light-matter interaction for more than a decade. Over this period, a wide variety of SRR architectures, differing in size, geometry, and even material composition, have been investigated. However, the regime of near-field coupled SRRs has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate ultrastrong coupling using photocurrent spectroscopy in two prototypical near-field configurations: a SRR dimer and a topological SRR chain. The measurements reveal hybridization not only with bright resonant modes but also with optically dark modes and topological edge modes, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of the photocurrent spectroscopy. Moreover, the engineered near-field interactions allow the study of multi-mode ultrastrong coupling and the interplay between topological band structure and cavity quantum electrodynamics.</p>

Significant efforts aim to increase the critical temperature, to determine the electronic structure of the system, the underlying pairing mechanism, and the similarities between this system and cuprates - Ni1+ in infinite-layer nickelates being isoelectronic to Cu2+ in high-Tc cuprates. Here, we explore the unique role of magnetic rare earth ions in superconducting Eu-doped NdNiO2. We show that the field-induced re-entrant superconductivity which we evidence in this compound is the result of a delicate balance between the competing effects of the Eu2+ and Nd3+ ions. Our analyses of the extraordinary Hall effect and modeling of the superconducting critical fields demonstrate that the influence of these ions on magneto-transport is only felt when they are polarized by a magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity arises from the global phase coherence of Cooper pairs. The modulation of phase coherence leads to quantum phase transitions, serving as an important tool for the study of unconventional superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transitions in infinite-layer nickelate superconducting films by the control of spatially periodic network patterns. Magnetoresistance oscillations with a periodicity of h/2e provide direct evidence of 2e Cooper pairing in nickelates. The phase transitions are predominantly driven by enhanced superconducting fluctuations, with Cooper pairs involved in the charge transport across the transitions. Notably, we observe two types of anomalous metallic phases, emerging respectively in finite and down to zero magnetic fields. They can be characterized by bosonic excitations, suggesting the dynamic roles of vortices at the ground states. Our work establishes nickelates as a key platform for investigating the rich landscape of bosonic phases controlled via the phase coherence of Cooper pairs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Khodas, Libor Šmejkal, I. I. Mazin</p>
            <p>We discuss a possibility of superconductivity in the p-wave magnets. These are recently discovered materials that have zero net magnetization by symmetry and finite non-relativistic spin splitting of electron bands, like in altermagnets. Similarly, the spin polarizations is collinear in the momentum space. Yet, as opposed to altermagnets, the magnetization is noncollinear in the real space, and the spin splitting obeys time-reversal symmetry in the momentum space. As a result, if such material harbors superconductivity (due to phonons, or any other mechanism), the only supported superconducting symmetry is Ising superconductivity, an exotic symmetry where any Cooper pair is a 50:50 mix of singlet and triplet. This unusual behavior is also in stark contrast to regular antiferromagnet, which can support Cooper pairs of any parity, and altermagnets, which can only support nonunitary triplet pairs. The presence of large triplet component and enhanced resilience against pair breaking is inherent to the p-wave magnets and as such is unconventional as it does not materialize in conventional spin-orbit coupling induced Ising superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Flux-tunable transmon incorporating a van der Waals superconductor via an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eliya Blumenthal, Ilay Mangel, Amit Kanigel, Shay Hacohen-Gourgy</p>
            <p>Incorporating van der Waals (vdW) superconductors into Josephson elements extends circuit-QED beyond conventional Al/AlO$_x$/Al tunnel junctions and enables microwave probes of unconventional condensates and subgap excitations. In this work, we realize a flux-tunable transmon whose nonlinear inductive element is an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction. The tunnel barrier is formed by sequential deposition and full in-situ oxidation of ultrathin Al layers on an exfoliated 4Hb-TaS$_2$ flake, followed by deposition of a top Al electrode, yielding a robust, repeatable hybrid junction process compatible with standard transmon fabrication. Embedding the device in a three-dimensional copper cavity, we observe a SQUID-like flux-dependent spectrum that is quantitatively reproduced by a standard dressed transmon--cavity Hamiltonian, from which we extract parameters in the transmon regime. Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~\mu$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system. Although we do not resolve material-specific subgap modes in the present geometry, this work establishes a practical route to integrating 4Hb-TaS$_2$ into coherent quantum circuits and provides a baseline for future edge-sensitive designs aimed at enhancing coupling to boundary and subgap degrees of freedom in vdW superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Structure: Invariant Crystal Property Prediction with Pseudo-Particle Ray Diffraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Cao, Yang Liu, Longhan Zhang, Yifan Wu, Zhixun Li, Yuyu Luo, Hong Cheng, Yang Ren, Tong-Yi Zhang</p>
            <p>Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-range atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

            <h2>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerardo Ortiz, Chinmay Giridhar, Philipp Vojta, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy, Zohar Nussinov</p>
            <p>We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</p>

            <h2>Detecting the full photoemission cone from laser-based ARPES experiments by leveraging deflector technology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Gauthier, Benson Kwaku Frimpong, Dario Armanno, Akib Jabed, Francesco Goto, Vicky Hasse, Claudia Felser, Genda Gu, Heide Ibrahim, Francois Légaré, Fabio Boschini</p>
            <p>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a direct access to the electronic band structure of solid and molecular systems. The momentum range accessible by this technique depends directly on the photon energy used, and low-photon-energy sources are insufficient to photoemit electrons over the full Brillouin zone of most quantum materials. In addition, while electrons are emitted over a 2$\pi$ solid angle, conventional hemispherical analyzers only collect a small subset of those electrons. A previous work [RSI 92, 123907 (2021)] demonstrated that electrons emitted over a larger field-of-view can be acquired in one fixed configuration by accelerating them towards the analyzer with a bias voltage. Here, we extend this work by leveraging the deflector technology of novel ARPES hemispherical analyzers. We demonstrate the ability to detect all $2\pi$ photoemitted electrons in a fixed configuration for various materials such as gold, cuprates and transition-metal dichalcogenides. This approach is especially advantageous for time-resolved ARPES, as electron dynamics over a large momentum range can be accessed with identical measurement conditions.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of Ferroelectric and Optical Properties in KNbO3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiden Ross, Venkatraman Gopalan, Long-Qing Chen</p>
            <p>Potassium niobate (KNbO3) is a prototypical perovskite ferroelectric with large electro-optic and nonlinear optical responses, high optical damage thresholds and a rich sequence of temperature-driven phase transformations, making it a promising platform for tunable photonic devices. In this work, we develop a thermodynamic model for the coupled ferroelectric and optical properties of KNbO3. By separating the total polarization into lattice and electronic contributions, the model provides a unified description of both the anisotropic ferroelectric and optical properties. The thermodynamic coefficients are determined by fitting to experimental measurements of the spontaneous polarization, dielectric susceptibilities, lattice parameters, and refractive indices. Without any further fitting, the model quantitatively predicts the temperature dependence of the electro-optic and piezoelectric coefficients in close agreement with experimental measurements. By utilizing the electronic polarization equation of motion, the model further captures the optical dispersion in the near infrared to visible spectrum. This work provides the thermodynamic foundation for future studies of coupled ferroelectric and optical phenomena in KNbO3.</p>

Physikalische Chemie, Berlin, Germany)</p>
            <p>There are conflicting predictions and reports on the character of the exciton Mott transition (EMT) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. It could be either a discontinuous or a continuous transition from the excitonic to the plasma phase, with important implications for devices such as photoswitches. To resolve the nature of the transition in monolayer WS$_2$, we study its ultrafast optical response upon resonant photoexcitation of the A exciton across a broad range of photoexcitation densities. In agreement with previously reported measurements we observe that the A exciton quenches gradually with increasing excitation density. However, a detailed lineshape analysis unveils an abrupt red shift in the transient peak positions of the A and B exciton resonances above an excitation density threshold. This is attributed to band gap renormalization arising from the formation of free charge carrier plasma, i.e., the EMT. The plasma phase decays with a time constant of 0.65 ps back into the excitonic state. The abrupt appearance of the plasma phase at the threshold density suggests that the EMT is a discontinuous and not a continuous transition. This work demonstrates how transient optical spectroscopy combined with lineshape analysis of two excitonic resonances simultaneously can be used to investigate the EMT in 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-protected topological polarons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaifa Luo, Jon Lafuente-Bartolome, Feliciano Giustino</p>
            <p>Emergent quasiparticles in solids often exhibit unique topological properties as a result of the complex interplay between charge, orbital, spin and lattice degrees of freedom. Among these quasiparticles, the polaron occupies a special place as the first known manifestation of the interaction between a fermion and a boson field. While polarons have been investigated for almost a century, whether these quasiparticles exhibit topological properties and why remain open questions. Here, we establish the universal symmetry principles governing the topology of polar textures in large polarons. Using a group-theoretic analysis, we identify four distinct classes of polar textures in time-reversal-invariant systems, and we show that they carry integer topological charges. We validate this classfication by performing state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of materials representative of each class. For these materials, we compute the fingerprints of polaron topology in Huang diffuse scattering, and propose ultrafast electron and X-ray scattering experiments to detect these quasiparticles.</p>

            <h2>Electric-field controlled nonlinear anomalous Nernst effect in two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Li Wu, Xiao-Qin Yu</p>
            <p>It's established that the nonlinear anomalous Nernst effect (NANE), originating from Berry curvature near the Fermi energy, is symmetry-permitted only when a single mirror symmetry exists in the transport plane of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we show that an applied direct electric field can lift this symmetry constraint, enabling an electric-field-induced NANE emerge in time-reversal symmetric 2D systems with higher crystallographic symmetries. This electric-field-induced NANE arises from both Berry connection polarization, rooted in the electric-field-corrected Berry curvature, and the anomalous-velocity-modified nonequilibrium Fermi distribution function. Additionally, we propose an alternating temperature gradient as a driving force instead of the conventional steady one, ensuring experimental detection of NANE via second-harmonic measurement techniques. The behaviour of electric-field-induced NANE in the monolayer graphene has been theoretically and systematically investigated.</p>

            <h2>Catalog of phonon emergent particles and chiral phonons: Symmetry-based classification and materials database investigation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Houhao Wang, Dongze Fan, Hoi Chun Po, Xiangang Wan, Feng Tang</p>
            <p>Chirality and topology are fundamental and ubiquitous in nature. Symmetry has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting topological phonons. However, to date, topological phonon emergent particles (EMPs) have not been systematically cataloged in material databases. Moreover, traditional symmetry methods are often inadequate for predicting chiral phonons, because realistic calculations can yield negative results even when symmetry analysis permits phonon chirality. Here, we first establish a complete symmetry-based classification: given any space group and Wyckoff positions (WYPOs) occupied by atoms, the number of occurrences of all (co-)irreducible representations ((co-)irreps) (that can host EMPs) can be unambiguously known without omission prior to expensive and parameter-dependent calculation. Moreover, whether a phonon mode (belonging to one (co-)irrep) is chiral can also be determined from the occupied WYPOs. We then perform a materials database investigation identifying over 25 million EMPs at high-symmetry points and along high-symmetry lines and computing the concrete value of phonon angular momentum for each mode. We demonstrate two main applications: identifying ideal materials with surface chirality momentum locking and identifying materials with giant phonon magnetic moment. All computational data are compiled into a website: this http URL, which is expected to stimulate future studies on topological and chiral phonons.</p>

            <h2>Tunable two-dimensional Dirac-Weyl semimetal phase induced by altermagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lizhou Liu, Qing-Feng Sun, Ying-Tao Zhang</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a tunable Dirac-Weyl semimetal phase in two dimensions, realized by introducing in-plane d-wave altermagnetism into a Dirac system. This phase hosts both a central Dirac point and momentumseparated Weyl points connected by Fermi line edge states. The Weyl point positions--and thus the edge-state connectivity--can be continuously tuned by rotating the altermagnetic axis. In contrast, out-of-plane altermagnetism gaps part of the bulk spectrum while preserving a single Dirac point accompanied by chiral edge modes, as evidenced by quantized edge polarization. Our findings provide a tunable platform for manipulating Dirac-Weyl physics and topological edge transport in two dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Complex spin dynamics induced metamagnetic phase transitions in Dirac semimetal EuAuBi</h2>

            <p>We report a comprehensive investigation of the physical properties of the Dirac semimetal compound EuAuBi single crystals, using neutron diffraction, magnetization, electrical transport, and specific heat measurements. EuAuBi crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with space group P63mc (No. 186). First-principles calculations using density functional theory characterize it as a Dirac semimetal, with a notable band-crossing in proximity to the Fermi level (EF ) along the {\Gamma}-A direction. The crystal exhibits three distinct magnetic phases at 4 K (TN1), 3.5 K (TN2), and 2.8 K (TN3)as observed from magnetic and specific heat measurements. However, zero-field neutron diffraction resolves only two magnetic phases: a commensurate antiferromagnetic phase and a canted antiferromagnetic phase. Field-dependent ac and dc magnetization measurements uncover field-induced non-trivial spin textures in the magnetic field range 1.5 to 3 T, manifested as a tilted plateau in the magnetization curves. The interplay between conduction carriers and these spin textures is further evidenced by unique features in the magnetic field-dependent longitudinal resistivity in the system. Finally, we present a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram of EuAuBi, highlighting diverse spin alignments present in the material. EuAuBi thus emerges as a rare material system in which both momentum-space and real-space Berry curvature effects may coexist, providing a unique opportunity to investigate their interplay.</p>

            <p>Magnetic-field-driven Lifshitz transitions are typically considered zero-temperature phenomena involving Fermi-surface reconstruction without symmetry breaking. Here, we report an unconventional Lifshitz transition in TaCo2Te2 that emerges exclusively within a narrow finite-temperature window under cooperative tuning by both temperature and magnetic field. Bulk-sensitive transport and thermoelectric measurements demonstrate continuous Fermi-surface renormalization at low temperatures, where the transition is sharply triggered by a critical magnetic field. Crucially, neutron diffraction reveals the absence of structural or magnetic phase transitions, while angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy shows no spectral anomalies in electronic structure without magnetic field. These observations constrain the mechanism to a Zeeman-driven process invisible to equilibrium probes, establishing a paradigm where Fermi-surface topology is jointly controlled by temperature and magnetic field.</p>

            <p>We used density functional theories (DFT) to investigate the properties of Au2O and Au2O3-x (x = 00.08) to reveal their remarkable functionalities. Hybrid functional theories accurately estimate the band gap (Eg) of oxides, and the present hybrid functional calculations determined Eg values of 0.96 eV for Au2O and 2.86 eV for Au2O3, which is >300% of the commonly accepted Eg of Au2O3 (0.85 eV). Moreover, we discovered spontaneous polarization (PS) in Au2O3, which is unusually large and advantageous for catalysis. The PS was retained even in 2-nm-thick Au2O3 nanosheets, similar to hyperferroelectric, generating a potential of 0.6 eV despite screening caused by surface reconstruction, which is a novel screening mechanism. Below a thickness of 0.8 nm, the PS vanished, and inversion symmetry emerged at 0.4 nm, suggesting a new approach to finding a paraelectric phase. Au2O was supersoft under shear distortion.</p>

            <p>Active matter often simultaneously exhibits different kinds of orientational order and, in many cases of biological interest, undergoes continuous material renewal. In renewing nematopolar fluids we find stable topological strings, structures consisting of two nematic point defects connected by a defect line in the polar field. We identify the mechanism underlying string stabilization and unveil how string length is determined. In the presence of active stress, we observe active-string chaos. Our work identifies continuous material renewal as a generic mechanism underlying the stabilization of topological defect structures in systems with mixed order parameters.

            <p>Kagome materials are at the frontier of condensed matter physics. An ideal kagome lattice features only one geometrically frustrated flat band spanning the entire momentum space and a single Dirac cone at the Brillouin-zone corners. However, for the first time, here we observe unusual flat-band and Dirac physics in the newly discovered "322" kagome material Ni3In2S2 by combining high-resolution synchrotron- and laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, scanning tunneling microscopy, and first-principles calculations. We resolve two distinct electronic flat-band states located in close proximity to the Fermi level: a robust Topological Surface Flat Band at ~40 meV below the Fermi level on the Sulfur-terminated surface, originating from weak topological insulator states, and a kagome lattice-derived flat band at ~100 meV binding energy with an ultranarrow bandwidth (~5 meV). Instead of the single Dirac cone, the Indium-terminated surface hosts a rare two-dimensional Dirac-node arc state, where the gapless Dirac nodes extend along an open one-dimensional line crossing the Brillouin-zone boundary, exhibiting sharp linear dispersion, exceptionally high Fermi velocity, and pronounced circular dichroism. These findings establish Ni3In2S2 as a unique topological kagome metal in which multiple flat-band states of different physical origin coexist with an unusual Dirac-node arc, opening an avenue for discovering flat-band--driven and topology-enabled quantum phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Hyperuniformity and Quantum Weight</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junmo Jeon, Shiro Sakai</p>
            <p>Extending hyperuniformity from classical to quantum fluctuations in electron systems yields a framework that identifies quantum phase transitions and reveals underlying gap structures through the quantum weight. We study long-wavelength fluctuations of many-body ground states through the charge-density structure factor by incorporating intrinsic quantum fluctuations into hyperuniformity. Although charge fluctuations at zero temperature are generally suppressed by particle-number conservation, their long-wavelength scaling reveals distinct universal behaviors that define quantum hyperuniformity classes. By exemplifying the Aubry-Andre model, we find that gapped, gapless, and localized-critical-extended phases are sharply distinguished by the quantum hyperuniformity classes. Notably, at the critical point, multifractal wave functions generate anomalous scaling behavior. We further show that, in quantum-hyperuniform gapped phases, the quantum weight provides a quantitative measure of the gap size through a universal power-law scaling. Along with classical hyperuniformity, quantum hyperuniformity serves a direct fingerprint of quantum criticality and a practical probe of quantum phase transitions in aperiodic electron systems.</p>

In this study, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition was transferred from copper onto the top of the standard AlGaN/GaN wafer, forming a heterostructure with two conducting layers separated by an AlGaN barrier layer. Contacts fabricated to the two-dimensional electron gas and graphene allowed us to study the drag current induced in graphene by passing the drive current through the two-dimensional electron gas. At low temperatures, the graphene drag current exhibited quantum oscillations as a function of the drive voltage. As temperature increases, quantum oscillations disappear, and the magnitude of the drag current increases. Graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are a promising platform for studying drag and two-stream instability effects, especially if the AlGaN barrier layer thickness can be reduced to a few nanometers.</p>

            <p>Continuous measurement of quantum systems provides a standard route to quantum trajectories through the successive acquisition of information which further results in measurement back-action. In this work, we harness this back-action as a resource for global $U(1)$ symmetry restoration where continuous measurement is combined with a $U(1)$-preserving unitary evolution. Starting from a $U(1)$ symmetry-broken initial state, we simulate quantum trajectories generated by continuous measurements of both global and local observables. We show that under global monitoring, states containing superpositions of distant charge sectors restore symmetry faster than those involving nearby sectors. We establish the universality of this behavior across different measurement protocols. Finally, we demonstrate that local monitoring can further accelerate symmetry restoration for certain states that relax slowly under global monitoring.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seung-Ju Hong, Tae Yun Kim, Cheol-Hwan Park</p>
            <p>$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a candidate Kitaev material that exhibits zigzag antiferromagnetic ordering below 7 K. One contentious issue regarding this material is its bulk structure in the low-temperature phase. Recently, it has become generally accepted from experiments that the low- and high-temperature structures belong to the $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ space groups, respectively. However, there was no theoretical study supporting the $R\bar{3}$-type structure as the low-temperature structure. In this study, we use constrained density functional theory to show that the $R\bar{3}$ structure is lower in energy than the $C2/m$ structure, in agreement with experimental observations. Then, we show that the conduction band minimum states are almost of the $J_\textrm{eff}=1/2$ and $m_\textrm{eff}=-1/2$ character, if we set the angular momentum quantization axis to be parallel to the Néel vector; this is the first analysis of the $J_\textrm{eff}$ picture for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ from this perspective. In addition, we compute the anisotropic magnetic exchange parameters and $g$ factors of monolayer $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of its magnetism. Our results demonstrate that both second-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions and magnetic moments not captured by the conventional atomic orbital projection method are necessary for accurate description of the magnetism in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Moreover, the calculated $g$ factors are in fairly good agreement with experimental measurements, especially the small anisotropy between their in-plane and out-of-plane components. Finally, we examine the effects of structural distortions from a perfect RuCl$_6$ octahedron, already present in bulk $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ without any external perturbation, on the magnetic properties.

            <p>This study examines electrostatic screening effects in graphene using tight binding calculations under the BBC and modified BBC models, with sigmav ranging from 0.00 to 3.00. Our results demonstrate that the modified BBC potential decays, which effectively suppresses electron-electron interactions. Hopping integrals decrease by 65% over distance and shift 7% with sigmav, while on site energy rises linearly by 0.045 eV. A band gap opens for sigmav greater than or equal to 1.00. The density of states peaks near the Fermi level, with the low energy region largely unaffected. Graphene's low energy helical wave functions yield topological features like pseudospin momentum locking and a pi Berry phase, leading to distinct transport behavior. The model avoids the Coulomb singularity, offering insights for 2D screening engineering and topological device design.</p>

Regnault, Xiaodong Xu, Xiaoyang Zhu</p>
            <p>The interplay among electronic correlation, topology, and time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) often leads to exotic quantum states of matter. Primary examples include the recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2) and multilayer graphene aligned with hBN, where TRS is broken in partially filled flat moire Chern bands. Among the FCIs in tMoTe2, the most robust is at a hole filling of v = -2/3 per moire unit cell. Interestingly, transient optical sensing and more recent transport measurements revealed a correlated state at v = -4/3, twice the filling factor for the v = -2/3 FCI. Here, employing pump-probe circular dichroism (CD) measurements on tMoTe2 with twist angles = 3.9 degree and 3.7 degree, we find that the v = -4/3 state exhibits vanishing magnetization (m = 0) in finite windows of out-of-plane magnetic field less than ~2-4 mT, and a first order phase transition to + - m states at higher fields. This out-of-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM) like behavior is notably absent for all other correlated states and disappears for the v = -4/3 state at higher or lower twist angles = 4.0 degree and 3.3 degree. The observed magnetic signature at v = -4/3 is consistent with a predicted fractional topological insulator (FTI) with TRS, consisting of two copies of -2/3 FCIs with opposite chiralities. We support these findings with calculations in the interacting continuum model of tMoTe2. Our work presents a candidate for fractional topological insulators with TRS.</p>

            <h2>Exotic vortex states at high magnetic fields in a quasi-two-dimensional FeSe-based superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuyang Li, Jian Li, Kai Liu, Jiaqiang Cai, Shunjiao Li, Baolei Kang, Mengzhu Shi, Dan Zhao, Chuanying Xi, Jinglei Zhang, Tao Wu, Xianhui Chen</p>
            <p>Owing to strong electronic correlations, high-temperature superconductivity always exhibits intricate intertwinement with various competing electronic orders in phase diagrams, such as spin/charge density waves (S/CDWs). In cuprate superconductors,the intertwinement of superconductivity and CDW order could strongly affect the fundamental properties of superconductivity, such as the critical temperature(Tc) and critical magnetic field(Hc). Recent high-field transport measurements indicate that when quantum fluctuations become important at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, the CDW order also reshapes the vortex states, which leads to fragile superconductivity with extremely low critical current(Jc). Here, by performing comprehensive high-field transport measurements, the H-T phase diagram of vortex states is mapped to H = 33 T in a quasi-two-dimensional FeSe-based superconductor (TBA+)xFeSe with a zero-resistivity transition temperature above 40 K. Our results indicate that (TBA+)xFeSe is an extremely type II superconductor with significant thermal this http URL low temperatures, high magnetic fields cause the vortex solid state to exhibit similar current-dependent zero-resistance behavior as the fragile superconductivity in cuprate superconductors with CDW order. When the vortex solid state is melted with increasing temperature, a superconducting regime with vortex-like phase fluctuations emerges as an intermediate state, which features finite longitudinal resistance and vanishing Hall resistance. At higher temperatures, a vortex liquid state with finite Hall resistance eventually appears due to thermal fluctuations. All these observations suggest exotic vortex states beyond the classical paradigm of vortex matter.</p>

            <h2>Formation Dynamics of Quantum Droplets for Homonuclear and Heteronuclear Mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrique Calderoli, Gerardo Martinez</p>
            <p>Great effort has been invested over the past decade in studying the properties of quantum droplets, a phase of bosonic quantum matter that arises as a consequence of the fluctuating Lee-Huang-Yang correction. However, the dynamics of droplet formation for heteronuclear Bose mixtures is partially understood. Here, we numerically analyze the formation process for homonuclear and heteronuclear boson mixtures in one dimension using a tight-binding model and real-time evolution. A systematic sweep of interaction strengths, mass ratios, and initial conditions allows us to characterize quantitative criteria for droplet formation and equilibration. We find that the energy contribution of the LHY correction dominates the energetic profile of the droplets formed, with the deepest binding occurring for mass ratios $m_2/m_1 \in [1.2,2.0]$. Breathing oscillations are observed, and the low equilibration rate is consistent with the restricted nature of the phase space for one-dimensional systems; the oscillation frequency is found to have a very weak correlation to the interaction strengths. For the simulation, Gaussian over discrete initial conditions are clearly favorable to the formation of droplets. The results contained herein provide rich insight into the dynamical nature of quantum droplet physics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the collective excitation spectrum and dynamics of a quasi two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba type spin-orbit (SO) coupling. Employing Bogoliubov-de-Gennes analysis, we analytically compute the excitation spectra across a wide range of interaction strengths and coupling parameters. By systematically varying the SO and Rabi couplings, we uncover distinct dynamical signatures of quantum phase transitions, including mode softening, the appearance of roton-like minima, and miscibility-driven instabilities in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interaction regimes. In the antiferromagnetic case, these instabilities lead to a dynamically unstable supersolid phase characterized by the coexistence of density modulation and global phase coherence. To corroborate the analytical predictions, we numerically solve the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations and analyze the dynamical stability of the condensate. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for spinor condensates with tunable spin-orbit coupling and demonstrate the rich interplay between spin-dependent interactions and synthetic couplings in nonequilibrium quantum fluids.</p>

            <h2>Boundary condition for phonon distribution functions at a smooth crystal interface and interfacial angular momentum transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Suzuki, Shuntaro Sumita, Yusuke Kato</p>
            <p>We theoretically elucidate the boundary conditions for phonon distribution functions of long-wavelength acoustic phonons at smooth crystal interfaces. We first derive boundary conditions that fully incorporate reflection, transmission, and mode conversion. We obtain these conditions for phonons from those for classical lattice vibrations, using the correspondence between the quantum and classical descriptions. This formulation provides a theoretical foundation for the acoustic mismatch model, widely used to analyze Kapitza resistance. We then refine the boundary conditions to include spatial dependence parallel to the interface. The refined form captures transverse shifts of elastic wave packets, analogous to the optical Imbert--Fedorov shift, and ensures conservation of total angular momentum. Consequently, circularly polarized phonons carrying spin angular momentum (SAM) generate phonon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at the interface. We analytically determine the spatial profile of this OAM and demonstrate that SAM and OAM are both involved in the interfacial diffusion of chiral phonons. Our theory provides concise boundary conditions for phonons, with applications ranging from heat transport to phonon angular momentum transport.</p>

            <p>Aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as normal alkanes, constitute a naturally abundant source of carbon atoms. Of special interest is the formation of cyclic and aromatic products from aliphatic reactants. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy and ab initio calculations, we investigate the thermal induced aromatization of linear n octane molecules on the catalytic Pt(111) surface and the reactions of intermolecular homocoupling between them at temperatures above 600 K. The cycloaromatization of individual n octane molecules requires bending the linear adsorbates prior to their dehydrogenation and the formation of an intramolecular C-C bond, yielding adsorbed benzene rings. In addition, the Pt(111) surface catalyzes a homocoupling reaction by initiating the formation of a C-C bond between the dehydrogenated methyl ends of the chemisorbed n octane molecules and then propagating along the carbon backbone in a zipper like fashion. Our findings provide molecular level insight into the heterogeneous catalytic processes underlying the generation of aromatic products and stable on surface polycyclic species.</p>

            <h2>Role of transfer films and interfacial cracking in metallic sliding wear</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R.Xu, B.N.J. Persson</p>
            <p>The origin of wear particles in metallic sliding contacts remains debated. Classical views based on cold-welded junctions suggest that plastic yielding of the real contact area should lead to large wear coefficients, in apparent contradiction with the small values typically measured for metals. Here we argue that this discrepancy can be resolved if most junctions do not directly produce wear particles, but instead cause metal transfer and the formation of a weakly bound transfer film. Wear then occurs intermittently when fragments of this film detach due to crack propagation at the interface between the transfer film and the underlying bulk metal. We perform unlubricated reciprocating sliding experiments on nominally smooth stainless steel, brass, and aluminum. For steel on steel, the wear mass loss shows an initial stage with negligible mass change up to a sliding distance of $\sim 2.4 \ {\rm m}$, followed by a linear regime. Transfer-film formation in dissimilar-metal contacts is evidenced by optical imaging, net mass gain of the steel slider, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and the collected debris is flake-like. These observations support a transfer-film-controlled wear mechanism associated with cold-welded junctions.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the objective of quantifying the energetic cost of accessing boundary phases through local control, we investigate here a simple, analytically tractable quantum impurity model. This model exhibits a rich boundary phase diagram, characterized by phases with different numbers of edge states. By considering a local quench protocol that drives the system out of equilibrium, we calculate exactly the resulting quantum work distribution across these phases. Our results show that the presence of edge states strongly alters this distribution. In particular, we analytically determine key fingerprints of these states both near the low-energy threshold and in the high-energy region.</p>

            <p>Superconducting systems may display different types of nonequilibrium states depending on the specific constraints imposed for measurement. We probe current-voltage relations of three-dimensional superconducting films by allowing finite voltages to develop across their length. Our experiments reveal sharp features of negative differential conductance which highlight the validity of the principle of minimum entropy production at the critical current transition. We have observed dissipative states with resistances intermediate between those of superconducting and normal phases at zero applied magnetic field, indicating a phenomenon of phase coexistence under nonequilibrium conditions.

            <h2>Multi-target density matrix renormalization group for 3D CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Xiang Hao, Zheng Zhu, Yang Qi</p>
            <p>The fuzzy sphere regularization provides a powerful framework for studying three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs) by mapping them onto numerically tractable lattice models on the spherical lowest Landau level. However, the system sizes accessible to this method have been limited by the exact diagonalization (ED). In this work, we transcend this limitation by combining the fuzzy sphere regularization with a sophisticated multi-target density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. Focusing on the 3D Ising-type model on the spherical lowest Landau level, we calculate the 24 low-lying energies at a larger system size than previously feasible with ED. At criticality, we extract the scaling dimensions of six primary operators, and the results show significantly improved agreement with bootstrap benchmarks compared to previous ED results at smaller sizes. Our approach allows us to efficiently target multiple excited states in larger systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. This study establishes the fuzzy sphere regularization combined with advanced DMRG techniques as a powerful and general framework for precision physics in 3D CFTs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, Marios Michael, Andrea Cavalleri, Eugene Demler</p>
            <p>Pump-probe experiments performed on $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ have unveiled both optical and transport signatures of metastable light-induced superconductivity up to room temperature, far above $T_c$. Recent experiments have uncovered that excitation in the vicinity of $50 ~\textrm{meV}$ enables the observation of high temperature light-induced superconductivity at significantly lower fluences. Inspired by these experiments we develop a mechanism which can explain such a giant resonant enhancement of light-induced superconductivity. Within a minimal non-linear Holstein model, we show that resonantly driving optical Raman modes leads to a time-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Such a coupling then modulates the effective electron-electron attraction, with the strongest modulations occurring when the drive is resonant with the phonon frequency. These dynamical modulations of the pairing interactions lead to Floquet-BCS instabilities at temperatures far exceeding equilibrium $T_c$, as observed in experiments. We conclude by discussing the implications of our general analysis on the $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ experiments specifically and suggesting experimental signatures of our mechanism.</p>

            <p>One-dimensional kagome strip chains share much of the same frustrated structural motif as two-dimensional kagome antiferromagnets, making them valuable for deepening our understanding of kagome lattice magnetism. In this paper, we report the hydrothermal synthesis and detailed structural and property characterization of Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, a striped kagome system. The crystal structure was characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals that Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system C2/m. The structure features a one-dimensional kagome strip lattice built from Co2+ ions and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 14 K. The magnetic ground state at zero field was characterized using neutron powder diffraction. Below the magnetic transition, Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 orders into an antiferromagnetic structure with a k-vector (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In the proposed model, the Co1 moment is predominantly confined to the ac-plane while the Co2 moment is primarily aligned along the b-axis. Two flat bands were observed in the inelastic neutron spectra below the magnetic transition at 5 and 10 meV. Inelastic neutron spectra were modeled with a Heisenberg Hamiltonian including three nearest-neighbor exchange interactions (J1, J2, J3) and strong single-ion anisotropy to stabilize the observed magnetic structure. Our study highlights the complexity of the Co2+-based kagome strip magnetic lattice compound Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, which provides an excellent platform to broaden our understanding of the frustrated kagome magnetic lattice space.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmions are topological quasiparticles potentially useful for memory and computing devices. Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions present no transverse deflection, making them suitable candidates for data storage applications. After the discovery of skyrmions with length scales comparable to the lattice constant, several works presented quantum analogues of classical ferromagnetic skyrmions in spin systems. However, studies about quantum analogues of AF skyrmions are still lacking. Here, we explore the phases of the AF quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions on the triangular lattice using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. We study the magnetization profile, spin structure factor and quantum entanglement of the resulting ground states to characterize the corresponding phases and signal the emergence of quantum AF skyrmions. Our results support that three-sublattice quantum antiferromagnetic skyrmion textures are stabilized in a wide range of magnetic fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahil Satapathy, Projjwal K. Kanjilal, A. Bhattacharyay</p>
            <p>We develop a simple and general variational method to estimate the solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations and obtain the corresponding density profiles for all spin states of a trapped spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. We further employ this approach to obtain the complete phase diagram of the system under quasi-one-dimensional harmonic confinement, with ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic spin interactions. We identify a suitable scaling that collapses all phase diagrams for different system sizes (i.e., total particle number) into a universal (system size-independent) phase diagram. The complete phase diagram for a confined system shows some significant qualitative differences compared to that of a condensate with homogeneous density distribution. The phase diagrams reported here could help identify the important parameter regimes in which phase transitions in the confined system, in general, occur. This knowledge of the region of phase boundaries can enable a reliable investigation of the instabilities near the boundaries that drive phase transitions.</p>

            <p>This work presents a study on the application of Time-Resolved Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TR-APXPS) in association with chemometric techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS), to investigate the surface chemistry and dynamics of Fe2O3 reduction processes. The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> So Hirata</p>
            <p>A size-extensive, converging, black-box coupled-cluster ($\Delta$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-spin electrons, any patterns of orbital occupancy, any spin multiplicities, and any spatial symmetries. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference, projection coupled-cluster ansatz. For degenerate references, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate RS perturbation ($\Delta$MP) theory, and is closely related to, but distinct from Li and Paldus's state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection (nonvariational) Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, whose practical utility seems rather limited except for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A determinant-based, general-order algorithm is implemented, generating $\Delta$CC energies through connected octuple excitations, which are compared with the results from CI, equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC), and SUMRCC theories up to the FCI limits as well as from $\Delta$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitations only and of single and double excitations. The order of performance is: $\Delta$CC $>$ EOM-CC $>$ CI at the same order or $\Delta$CC $>$ $\Delta$MP $>$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.</p>

            <p>Reaction-diffusion processes play an important role in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Decoherence Times in Finite-Memory Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramandeep Dewan</p>
            <p>Decoherence is often modeled using Markovian master equations that predict exponential suppression of coherence and are frequently used as effective bounds on quantum behavior in complex environments. Such descriptions, however, correspond to the singular physical limit of vanishing environmental memory. Here we formulate decoherence using a general time-nonlocal decoherence functional determined solely by the environmental force correlation function, with Markovian dynamics recovered explicitly as a limiting case. For arbitrary stationary environments with finite temporal correlations, we show that the decoherence functional exhibits quadratic short-time growth that is model-independent within the finite-memory class considered. Consequently, the decoherence time defined operationally-without assuming exponential decay-scales as the square root of the environmental correlation time, independent of the detailed form of the bath correlation kernel. These results are illustrated analytically for Gaussian-correlated, soft power-law, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environments. In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck case, the non-Markovian dynamics admit an exact analytical closure, yielding a closed evolution equation for the coherence. Exact numerical simulations based on a pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling and show that exponential decoherence emerges only in the memoryless limit. Beyond coherence decay, we distinguish decoherence rates from observable loss of quantum signatures by analyzing purity and von Neumann entropy dynamics. We show that suppression of a specific coherence element need not coincide with irreversible entropy production. Finally, we introduce an inferred-memory perspective in which the environmental correlation time is treated as an operationally extractable parameter from dynamical data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ravi Venkata Surya Sai Mogilisetti, Partha Pratim Das, Rassel Raihan, Shiyao Lin</p>
            <p>Digital image correlation (DIC) has become one of the most popular methods for deformation characterization in experimental mechanics. DIC is based on optical images taken during experimentation and post-test image processing. Its advantages include the capability to capture full-field deformation in a non-contact manner, the robustness in characterizing excessive deformation induced by events such as yielding and cracking, and the versatility to integrate optical cameras with a variety of open-source and commercial codes. In this paper, we developed a new paradigm of DIC analysis by integrating camera control into the DIC process flow. The essential idea is to dynamically increase the camera imaging frame rate with excessive deformation or deformation rate, while maintaining a relatively low imaging frame rate with small and slow deformation. We refer to this new DIC paradigm as in-situ on-demand (ISOD) DIC. ISOD DIC enables real-time deformation analysis, visualization, and closed-loop camera control. ISOD DIC has captured approximately 178% more images than conventional DIC for samples undergoing crack growth due to its dynamically adjusted frame rate, with the potential to significantly enhance data richness for damage inspection without consuming excessive storage space and analysis time, thereby benefiting the characterization of intrinsic constitutive behaviors and damage mechanisms</p>

            <p>Coherent perfect absorption (CPA)-the time-reversed operation of lasing at threshold-relies on finely tuned interference and is intrinsically fragile to disorder and structural imperfections. Whether absorption can be endowed with topological protection, by analogy to topological lasing, has remained an open question. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a topological antilaser: the time-reversed counterpart of a topological laser, in which chiral edge modes of a photonic lattice enable perfect light absorption protected by topology. Using a nonreciprocal microwave network with low intrinsic loss, we show that the topological antilaser preserves near-unity absorption under strong disorder, and, unlike conventional antilasers, remains functional for arbitrary placements of dissipation and input ports, even when the lattice is strongly perturbed. This robustness arises from the disorder-immune propagation and stable spatial profile of the topological edge modes. Our results establish topologically protected absorption as the missing counterpart of topological lasing, opening new directions for studying robust energy dissipation, wave control, and coherent-absorption-based detection technologies.</p>

In this paper, we propose a framework for modeling historical dynamics as stochastic processes described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By viewing historical change through the lens of continuous-time dynamics, this framework provides a natural language to describe how structural trends and inherent random fluctuations interact to shape societal evolution. This approach allows us to handle the uncertainty in fragmentary historical records, moving beyond the dichotomy of structural determinism versus pure chance. We demonstrate that adopting this stochastic perspective unlocks a rich suite of analytical capabilities unavailable to static models. Specifically, we introduce methods to: (1) quantify the irreversibility; (2) detect exogenous perturbations; (3) perform multiple imputation for missing historical records. This framework offers a unified methodology for dissecting the stability, contingency, and dynamics of historical change.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Realization of Optimized Ternary Mirror Coatings</h2>

            <p>We report on the first experimental realization of multi-material dielectric mirror coatings designed through a multi-objective optimization algorithm to simultaneously minimize thermal noise and optical losses. We validate this design strategy by fabricating and characterizing two distinct ternary systems: a SiNx -based proof-of-concept and a Ti:GeO2 -based system targeting lower optical losses. The performance of the SiN x coating shows remarkable agreement with predictions, demonstrating a noise amplitude spectral density reduction of 0.82 with respect to current reference coatings, and validating our design-to-fabrication pipeline. The Ti:GeO2 -based system achieves the crucial goal of sub-ppm absorption; its measured thermal noise, however, is higher than the theoretically predicted level of 0.71, extrapolated from single-layer material characterization. A dedicated tolerance analysis confirms that this discrepancy is not attributable to random thickness errors, emphasizing that further studies of the manufacturing process are needed to fully exploit this combination of materials. This work establishes a robust methodology for producing complex, high-performance optical coatings tailored for precision experiments.</p>

            <p>Colour centres in silicon have great potential as single photon sources for quantum technologies. Some of them - like the T centre - also possess optically-active spins that enable spin-photon interfaces for generating entangled photons and multi-spin registers. This paper explores the generation of several types of colour centres in silicon for mass-manufacturable silicon-on-insulator quantum devices. We investigate how different processes in the device development affect the presence of the quantum emitters, including thermal annealing and fabrication steps for optical nanostructures. The study reveals coupled formation dynamics between different colour centres, identifies optimal parameters for annealing processes, and reports on the sensitivity to annealing duration and nanofabrication procedures for photonic integrated circuits. Furthermore, we discern stable optical signals from colour centres in silicon which have not been identified before.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brijesh FNU, Viet Thanh Duy Nguyen, Ashima Sharma, Md Harun Rashid Molla, Chengyi Xu, Truong-Son Hy</p>
            <p>Dielectric materials are critical building blocks for modern electronics such as sensors, actuators, and transistors. With the rapid recent advance in soft and stretchable electronics for emerging human- and robot-interfacing applications, there is a surging need for high-performance dielectric elastomers. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop soft elastomers that simultaneously possess high dielectric constants (k, related to energy storage capacity) and low Young's moduli (E, related to mechanical flexibility). While some new elastomer designs have been reported in individual (mostly one-off) studies, almost no structured dataset is currently available for dielectric elastomers that systematically encompasses their molecular sequence, dielectric, and mechanical properties. Within this context, we curate a compact, high-quality dataset of acrylate-based dielectric elastomers, one of the most widely explored elastomer backbones due to its versatile chemistry and molecular design flexibility, by screening and aggregating experimental results from the literature over the past 10 years. Building on this dataset, we propose a multimodal learning framework that leverages large-scale pretrained polymer representations from graph- and sequence-based encoders. These pretrained embeddings transfer rich chemical and structural knowledge from vast polymer corpora, enabling accurate few-shot prediction of both dielectric and mechanical properties from molecular sequences. Our results represent a new paradigm for transferring knowledge from pretrained multimodal models to overcome severe data scarcity, which can be readily translated to other polymer backbones (e.g., silicones, urethanes) and thus accelerate data-efficient discovery of soft high-k dielectric elastomers.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeki Hayran, John B. Pendry, Prasad P. Iyer, Francesco Monticone</p>
            <p>Time-varying photonic systems open new possibilities for controlling light, enabling photonic time crystals, time reflection and refraction, frequency conversion, synthetic gauge fields, optical nonreciprocity, among others. These effects emerge from the dynamic modulation of optical properties, which can mediate photonic transitions between eigenstates of different frequencies and/or wavevectors. To achieve such transitions, conventional approaches rely on periodic modulation schemes that demand ultrafast modulation rates and continuous energy input, posing significant practical challenges at optical frequencies. Here, we demonstrate that periodic-modulation-driven photonic transitions within the radiation continuum can be effectively mimicked using a single-period ultrafast pulse modulation, eliminating the need for sustained continuous modulation. By leveraging dispersion engineering in metasurfaces to tailor the density of states in the radiation continuum, we achieve controlled frequency transitions and theoretically demonstrate strong nonreciprocity for free-space waves as a key application. Our findings may guide future experimental research on time-varying photonics using materials such as transparent conductive oxides and semiconductors, expanding the possibilities for ultrafast and reconfigurable optical technologies. More broadly, our work may establish a practical and energy-efficient framework for dynamic photonic systems, with potential applications ranging from spatio-temporal wavefront manipulation to photonic computing and ultrafast signal processing.</p>

            <h2>In-depth analysis of bar formation mechanisms of disk galaxies in halos of different concentrations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Worrakitpoonpon</p>
            <p>We use $N$-body simulations to investigate the distinct bar formation processes in disks residing in halos of various concentrations. In a highly concentrated halo, the bar development is limited by the dominant multi-arm modes as a result of the swing amplification in the early stage. Only after the multi-arm modes decay, the bar growth proceeds mechanically owing to the particle trapping in continuation of that bar seed. In this scheme, the corotation resonance of the bar modes does not come into play at all, justified by a low amount of disk-halo angular momentum transfer and a modestly decreasing bar pattern speed. On the other hand, although reducing the halo concentration suggests the reduction of the preferred swing-amplified modes to be bi-symmetric, the bar formation in a lowly concentrated halo does not involve the swing amplification at all. Rather, the fast-growing linearly unstable bar modes of a single uniform frequency is solely the governing factor, attributed to a mild shearing. The bar modes trigger the corotation resonance since the beginning and such resonance is maintained until the end, which leads to a high amount of angular momentum transfer and a fast slowdown. For the intermediate halo concentration, the kinematical analyses of multiple non-axisymmetric modes suggests that the linear modes, the swing amplification, and the particle trapping are all present in the evolution chronology. To specify bars formed in the different halo concentrations, full analyses of the isophotal shape, the radial Fourier amplitude, and the resonance diagram can be of use.</p>

            <p>The Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg (TTSH) equations are one of the basic equations that are used to model turbulent behaviour in active matter, specifically the swarming of bacteria in suspension. They combine features of the incompressible Navier-Stokes, the Toner-Tu and Swift-Hohenberg equations, together with the important properties that they are linearly driven, and that the Laplacian diffusion is taken to be negative in combination with hyper-dissipation. We prove that the TTSH equations possess a finite-dimensional compact global attractor on the periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^d$ ($d=2,3$) and we establish explicit estimates for its Lyapunov dimension which agree with the heuristic prediction based on the Swift-Hohenberg length scale. The predominance of this length scale (as a vortex length scale) has been observed in both numerical and experimental studies of bacterial turbulence, so our methods and results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this phenomenon. We also carry out pseudospectral direct numerical simulations of these PDEs in dimension $d=2$ through which we obtain Lyapunov spectra for representative parameter values. We show that our numerical results are consistent with the analytically derived rigorous bounds.</p>

            <p>How water droplets move and slide on leaves influences plant ecophysiological and abiotic interactions, as well as the design of advanced bio-inspired wetting materials. Despite cross-disciplinary relevance, current descriptions of the in situ dynamics of droplets on living leaves focus almost exclusively on surface structure and chemistry, treating the leaf as a static, electrically neutral substrate. Here, three decades after the mechanistic discovery of the Lotus effect, we show that a yet 'hidden' force due to instantaneous electrical phenomena affect the dynamic droplet motion on living leaves. Using high-speed motion tracking and precision charge measurements, we show that droplets sliding on the pristine epicuticular wax layer on superhydrophobic Colocasia esculenta leaves strongly charge affecting its dynamics, previously observed only on synthetic (highly electronegative fluorinated) surfaces. Droplets accumulate charges of Qp,D1 = -0.02 to -0.15 nC per 30 uL droplet on pristine leaves. However, we specifically demonstrate the crucial role of the epicuticular wax layer plasticity: by a structural modification that decreases its roughness amplitude, the same leaves gain an impressive 30-40 fold enhancement in charge transfer (reaching Qt,D1 = -2.8 to -5.2 nC) slowing the droplet by half due to an estimated electrostatic force of 11 uN dominating the resistive forces. The charge accumulation is surface-history-dependent and charge quantities per droplet are surprisingly similar or even exceeding those recently reported from artificial surfaces. Our findings prove that electrostatic charging is a fundamental component of droplet-leaf interactions, opening new research directions from charge-affected leaf ecology to sustainable materials for droplet-based energy harvesting by tuning surface treatments and, moreover,...</p>

            <h2>Finite-Time Transition to Intermittency for a Stochastic Heat Equation Driven by the Square of a Gaussian Field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philippe Mounaix</p>
            <p>In this paper, we study the spatial behavior of the solution $\psi(x,t)$ to the stochastic heat equation $\partial_t\psi(x,t)-\frac{1}{2}\partial^2_{x^2} \psi(x,t)=g\, S(x,t)^2\, \psi(x,t)$, with $0\le t\le T$, $x\in\mathbb{R}$, and $\psi(x,0)=1$. Here, $g>0$ is a coupling constant and $S(x,t)$ is a stationary, homogeneous, and ergodic Gaussian field. Focusing on $\mathcal{E}(x,g)\equiv \psi(x,T)$ at a finite time $T>0$, we identify the critical coupling $g_c(T)$ above which the average of $\mathcal{E}(0,g)$ diverges. We show that in the subcritical regime $g<g_c(T)$, $\mathcal{E}(x,g)$ is spatially ergodic, with no intermittency, while in the supercritical regime $g>g_c(T)$ it becomes spatially intermittent and loses ergodicity. Our results differ from the extensively studied case where $S(x,t)^2$ is replaced by $S(x,t)$, in which intermittency appears only asymptotically as $T\to +\infty$, with no finite-time intermittency.</p>

            <p>The global optimization of atomic clusters represents a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry and materials science due to the exponential growth of local minima with system size (i.e., the curse of dimensionality). We introduce a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the low-rank structure of potential energy surfaces through Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. Our approach combines two complementary TT-based strategies: the algebraic TTOpt method, which utilizes maximum volume sampling, and the probabilistic PROTES method, which employs generative sampling. A key innovation is the development of physically-constrained encoding schemes that incorporate molecular constraints directly into the discretization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by identifying global minima of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 45 atoms. Furthermore, we establish its practical applicability to real-world systems by optimizing 20-atom carbon clusters using a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential, achieving geometries consistent with quantum-accurate simulations. This work establishes TT-decomposition as a powerful tool for molecular structure prediction and provides a general framework adaptable to a wide range of high-dimensional optimization problems in computational material science.</p>

            <h2>Order Out of Noise and Disorder: Fate of the Frustrated Manifold</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Halperin</p>
            <p>We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on compact two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience the competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$ (closed manifolds), and bounded cylinder $S^1 \times [0,H]$ (manifold with boundary). Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction accompanied by spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry: order emerges from the combination of two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with the manifold topology determining the character of the emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures, specifically bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. The symmetry breaking pattern depends on topology: SO(3)$\to$SO(2) on the sphere, SO(2)$\times$SO(2)$\to$SO(2)$\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the torus, and SO(2)$\to\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the cylinder. Unlike conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise through type-A diffusive Nambu-Goldstone dynamics, while the reduced-dimensional structure persists. Unlike conventional self-organizing systems that require external driving or fine-tuned nonlinearities, our model demonstrates that geometry and topology alone can channel randomness into order. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems, providing a geometric framework for understanding how disorder generates emergent spatial order on curved spaces.</p>

            <p>McSAS3 is the refactored successor to the original McSAS Monte Carlo small-angle scattering analysis software. It is intended to be integrated in automated data processing pipelines, but can also be used to process individual (batches of) scattering data.

McSAS3GUI will help to generate and test the three configuration files that McSAS3 needs for data read-in, Monte Carlo optimization and histogramming. The user interface can also be used to process individual files or batches, and can be augmented with machine-specific use templates. The Monte Carlo (MC) approach is able to fit most practical scattering patterns extremely well, resulting in form-free model parameter distributions. Theoretically, these can be distributions on any model parameter, but in practice the MC-optimized parameter is usually a (volume-weighted) size distribution, in absolute volume fraction for absolute-scaled data.</p>

            <p>In this letter we study renormalization group (RG) flows between 2d conformal field theories enjoying extended higher-spin $\mathcal{W}$-symmetry. We propose a new class of RG flows between the diagonal minimal models of $\mathcal{W}_N$-algebra that take the form $\mathcal{W}_N(p,q)\to\mathcal{W}_N(p,kp-q)$. These are obtained by matching the anomalies of the non-invertible symmetry ${\mathrm{Rep}}[SU(N)_{p-N}]$ (and its discrete quotients) that is preserved by special relevant primary fields. This large non-invertible symmetry includes the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry of the minimal models. Our new flows furnish a significant generalization of the ones recently found in the case of Virasoro algebra, and include all previously known RG flows of $\mathcal{W}_N$. They have the remarkable property of being uniform in the rank $N$ of the $\mathcal{W}$-algebra.</p>

            <p>Accurately simulating long-time dynamics of many-body systems is a challenge in both classical and quantum computing due to the accumulation of Trotter errors. While low-order Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are straightforward to implement, their rapidly growing error limits access to long-time observables. We present a framework for constructing efficient high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes by identifying their structure and directly optimizing their parameters over a high-dimensional space. This method enables the discovery of new schemes with significantly improved efficiency compared to traditional constructions, such as those by Suzuki and Yoshida. Based on the theoretical efficiency and practical performance, we recommend two novel highly efficient schemes at $4^{\textrm{th}}$ and $6^{\textrm{th}}$ order. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of these decompositions on the Heisenberg model and the quantum harmonic oscillator, and find that for a fixed final time they perform better across the computational cost. Even when using large time steps, they surpass established low-order schemes like the Leapfrog. Finally, we investigate the in-practice performance of different Trotter schemes and find the decompositions with more uniform coefficients tend to feature improved error accumulation over long times. We have included this observation into our choice of recommended schemes.</p>

            <p>We propose an auxiliary-bath algorithm for the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method to solve multi-impurity models with shared electron baths. The method allows us to disentangle the electron baths into independent Wilson chains to perform standard NRG procedures beyond the widely adopted independent bath approximation. Its application to the 2-impurity model immediately reproduces the well-known even- and odd-parity channels. For 3-impurity Kondo models, we find collective screening of cluster degrees of freedom depending on impurity configurations and clarify the false prediction of a non-Fermi liquid ground state for the $C_3$ symmetric case in previous literature due to improper treatment of disentanglement. Our work highlights the importance of nonlocal spatial correlations due to shared baths and reveals a generic picture of successive collective screening for entropy depletion that is crucial in real correlated systems. Our method greatly expands the applicability of the NRG and opens an avenue for its further development.</p>

            <p>The field of electron optics exploits the analogy between the movement of electrons or charged quasiparticles, primarily in two-dimensional materials subjected to electric and magnetic (EM) fields and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium with varied refractive index. We significantly extend this analogy by introducing an electronic analogue of Fourier optics dubbed as Fourier electron optics (FEO) with massless Dirac fermions (MDF), namely the charge carriers of single-layer graphene under ambient conditions, by considering their scattering from a two-dimensional quantum dot lattice (TDQDL) treated within Lippmann-Schwinger formalism. By considering the scattering of MDF from TDQDL with a defect region, as well as the moiré pattern of twisted TDQDLs, we establish an electronic analogue of Babinet's principle in optics. Exploiting the similarity of the resulting differential scattering cross-section with the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, we construct a dictionary for such FEO. Subsequently, we evaluate the resistivity of such scattered MDF using the Boltzmann approach as a function of the angle made between the direction of propagation of these charge-carriers and the symmetry axis of the dot-lattice, and Fourier analyze them to show that the spatial frequency associated with the angle-resolved resistivity gets filtered according to the structural changes in the dot lattice, indicating wider applicability of FEO of MDF.</p>

            <p>We address the fate of many-body localization (MBL) of mid-spectrum eigenstates of a matter-free $U(1)$ quantum-link gauge theory Hamiltonian with random couplings on ladder geometries. Apart from level spacing distribution indicators like disorder-averaged mean level spacing, we also consider an intensive estimator $\mathcal{D} \in [0,1/4]$, which acts as a measure of elementary plaquettes on the lattice that are active or inert in mid-spectrum eigenstates as well as the concentration of these eigenstates in Fock space, with $\mathcal{D}$ equal to its maximum value of $1/4$ for Fock states in the electric flux basis. We calculate its distribution, $p(\mathcal{D})$, for $L_x \times L_y$ lattices, with $L_y=2$ and $4$, as a function of (a dimensionless) disorder strength $\alpha$ ($\alpha=0$ implies zero disorder) using exact diagonalization in many disorder realizations. Although finite-size estimators based on level spacings do not give a reliable critical disorder strength, $\alpha_c(L_y)$, beyond which MBL prevails as $L_x \rightarrow \infty$; a different estimator based on the skewness of $p(\mathcal{D})$ gives $\alpha_c(L_y=2)=31.04 \pm 0.54$ using data for $L_x \leq 14$ due to faster convergence. $p(\mathcal{D})$ for wider ladders with $L_y=4$ show a lower tendency to localize, suggesting a lack of MBL in two dimensions. A remarkable observation is the resolution of the (monotonic) infinite-temperature autocorrelation function of single plaquette diagonal operators in typical high-energy Fock states into a plethora of emergent timescales of increasing spatio-temporal heterogeneity as the disorder is increased. At intermediate $\alpha$ as well as for $\alpha$ slightly below $\alpha_c (L_y)$, a fraction of randomly selected initial Fock states display striking oscillatory temporal behavior of such plaquette operators in spatial regions formed out of connected plaquettes.</p>

In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</p>

            <h2>Theory of phonon angular momentum transport across a smooth crystal interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Suzuki, Shuntaro Sumita, Yusuke Kato</p>
            <p>We theoretically elucidate the transfer of phonon angular momentum by acoustic modes across a smooth interface between crystals. We analyze this process, which is difficult to describe with the conventional acoustic mismatch model, using a reformulated boundary condition and the Boltzmann theory. For an interface between a chiral and an achiral crystal, our analysis reveals that thermal gradients in the chiral crystal induce angular momentum, which diffuses into the achiral crystal even without heat flow. Notably, the density of angular momentum can be enhanced near the interface. These findings advance our understanding of phonon transport and its interplay with electron spins.</p>

            <p>Achieving parametric excitation in an oscillating physical system involves periodically adjusting one of its parameters to modulate the oscillator's natural frequency. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous systems within physics and engineering, profoundly transforming modern science and technology. Despite rapid progress, the parametric control of collective excitations, such as phonons, remains a challenge while promising to generate novel and intriguing effects in a largely unexplored field. Here, we investigate the terahertz (THz) field-induced dynamics of Raman-active phonons in the perovskite structure of LaAlO$_3$ (LAO). Utilizing intense THz pulses, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of parametric phonon excitation marked by substantial subharmonic components. Theoretical analysis can successfully capture the hallmarks of the observed phenomena in a physical scenario with the THz field inducing a parametric coupling between the Raman mode and pairs of acoustic phonon excitations.</p>

            <h2>Current density distribution for the quantum Hall effect</h2>

            <p>Our microscopic understanding of the integer quantum Hall effect is still incomplete. For decades, there has been a controversial discussion about "where the current flows" if the Hall resistance is quantized. Here, we qualitatively analyze the current density distribution in a Hall bar based on the screening properties of a two-dimensional electron system in the quantum Hall regime. Beyond previous publications, we include a closed loop persistent current that exists inside a Hall bar if the Hall resistance is quantized. We find, that the persistent current density decreases with increasing Hall voltage. Accounting for this dependence, we find, that the current flows in the opposite directions along opposite edges of the Hall bar, while the imposed current flows unidirectionally and only on the side of the Hall bar connected with its higher electrical potential edge.</p>

            <p>In twisted van der Waals materials, local atomic relaxation can alter the underlying electronic structure. Characterizing lattice reconstruction and its susceptibility to strain is essential for understanding emergent electronic states, especially in multilayers in which interference between moiré lattices yields larger supermoiré patterns whose energy is highly sensitive to local stacking. Here we image spatial modulations in the electronic character of helical trilayer graphene, which indicate relaxation into a superstructure of large domains with uniform moiré periodicity. We show that the supermoiré domain size is increased by strain and can be altered in the same device while preserving the local properties within each domain. Finally, we observe a higher conductance at the domain boundaries, consistent with predictions that they host counter-propagating edge modes. Our work provides a real-space visualization of moiré-periodic domains, reveals two independently tunable length scales and demonstrates strain engineering as a route towards designing correlated topological networks at the supermoiré scale.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments on planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, e.g., in Corbino geometry, have reported low-temperature nonzero Josephson currents in states with integer fluxoid (flux) induced in the junction by a perpendicular magnetic field. This effect was discussed in connection with Majorana zero modes localized in Josephson vortices of such junctions. Here, we provide an explanation for this phenomenon, attributing it to imperfections. We focus on the ``atomic" limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit, we can associate the nonvanishing critical current with the irregularities, e.g., in the junction's width. The low-temperature contribution to the current is provided by the bound states with low but nonzero energy. We also propose clear experimental tests based on microwave spectroscopy, revealing distinctive selection rules for vortex transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli</p>
            <p>(2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</p>

            <p>We study the low-energy physics of planar Josephson junction structures realized in a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor system proximity-coupled to narrow superconducting films. Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.</p>

            <p>Rare earth/transition metal (RE/TM) multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are key ingredients for the development of spintronic applications. Their compensation temperature depends on the ratio of the thicknesses of rare earth and transition metal, allowing their magnetic properties to be tuned with temperature while maintaining their anisotropy even in nanometer-scale devices. In this work, we performed a thorough structural characterization and systematically investigate the magnetic properties of a whole family of ferrimagnetic [Tb/Co]$_{\times 5}$ multilayers varying the Tb thickness in the range of 0.4 nm - 1.25 nm. A linear dependence of the compensation temperature on the Tb layer thickness was observed. Moreover, a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 330$\pm$30 kJ/m$^3$, which is close to the values reported by other authors, was estimated. Additionally, we proposed a model to gain a better understanding of the angular dependence of the magnetization loops and the linear dependence of the compensation temperature. We present strong evidence demonstrating that the perpendicular anisotropy must be tilted away from the perpendicular axis in order to explain the observed features, particularly the hysteresis in the in-plane loops. Our work advances the understanding of DC magnetic properties in thin RE/TM ferrimagnetic films, which has the potential to impact different fields where these materials are involved.</p>

            <p>Curvature plays a central role in the proper function of many biological processes. With active matter being a standard framework for understanding many aspects of the physics of life, it is natural to ask what effect curvature has on the collective behaviour of active matter. In this paper, we use the classical theory of surfaces to explore the active motion of self-propelled agents confined to move on a smooth curved two-dimensional surface embedded in Euclidean space. Even without interactions and alignment, the motion is non-trivially affected by the presence of curvature, leading to effects akin, e.g.\ to gravitational lensing and tidal forces. Such effects can lead to intermittent trapping of particles and profoundly affect their flocking behaviour. We show that these effects are governed by a geometric torque that, in the absence of noise and interactions, compels particles to move along geodesics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Puneet Pareek, Peter Sollich, Saroj Kumar Nandi, Ludovic Berthier</p>
            <p>Understanding the influence of activity on dense amorphous assemblies is crucial for biological processes such as wound healing, embryogenesis, or cancer progression. Here, we study the effect of self-propulsion forces of amplitude $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$ in dense assemblies of soft repulsive particles by simulating a model particle system that interpolates between particulate active matter and biological tissues. We identify the fluid and glass phases of the three-dimensional phase diagram obtained by varying $f_0$, $\tau_p$, and the packing fraction $\phi$. The morphology of the phase diagram directly accounts for a non-monotonic evolution of the relaxation time with $\tau_p$, which is a direct consequence of the crossover in the dominant relaxation mechanism, from glassy to jamming. A second major consequence is the evolution of the glassy dynamics from sub-Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius. We show that this tunable glass fragility extends to active systems analogous observations reported for passive particles. This analogy allows us to apply a dynamic scaling analysis proposed for the passive case, in order to account for our results for active systems. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences between our results and recent findings in the context of computational models of biological tissues.</p>

            <h2>Liquid-Gas Criticality of Hyperuniform Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shang Gao, Hao Shang, Hao Hu, Yu-Qiang Ma, Qun-Li Lei</p>
            <p>In statistical physics, it is well established that the liquid-gas (LG) phase transition with divergent critical fluctuations belongs to the Ising universality class. Whether non-equilibrium effects can alter this universal behavior remains a fundamental open question. In this work, we theoretically prove that non-equilibrium hyperuniform (HU) fluids with additional center-of-mass conservation exhibit LG criticality different from the Ising universality class. As a specific case, we investigate a 2D HU fluid composed of active spinners, where phase separation is driven by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the critical point, the 2D HU fluid displays finite density fluctuations $S(q)\sim q^{\eta}$ with $\eta=0$, while the compressibility still diverges. The critical point is thus calm yet highly susceptible, in fundamental violation of the conventional fluctuation-dissipation relation. Consistently, we observe short-range pairwise correlation functions coexisting with quasi-long-range response functions at the critical point. Based on a generalized Model B and renormalization-group analysis, we prove that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical dimension $d_c$ from $4$ to $2$. Moreover, the critical point exhibits Gaussian density fluctuations and non-divergent energy fluctuations. Furthermore, the HU fluid undergoes non-conventional spinodal decomposition. The origin of the above anomalies lies in the non-equilibrium nature of the system which obeys a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation $2\mathrm{Im}~ \chi(q,\omega) ={\omega }C(q,\omega)/{k_B T_{\text{eff}}(q)}$ with a scale-dependent effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}(q) \propto q^2$. These findings establish a striking exception to conventional paradigms of critical phenomena and illustrate how non-equilibrium forces can fundamentally reshape universality classes.</p>

We track the adiabatic evolution of Wannier centers to identify the bulk-polarization with second-order topological magnon insulator, where various magnon spectra demonstrate symmetry-protected band structure beyond conventional topology. Leveraging the stability and propagative properties of hinge modes, these unconventional magnons demonstrate manipulability in atomic-scale modifications of termination. Our study integrate altermagnetism with higher-order topology, which advance magnon-based quantum computing processing energy-efficient integrated architectures and information transfer.</p>

            <p>Combining superconducting and magnetic materials is a promising path to generate exotic interface subgap states. In this regard, altermagnetism is particularly interesting because it lifts spin degeneracy while providing tailored anisotropy of spin splittings. Here, we investigate the realization and control of subgap states by using the symmetry contrast between altermagnetic fields and unconventional pairings. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands as the Bogoliubov Fermi surface, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of a Sokoban random walker moving in a disordered medium with obstacle density $\rho$. In contrast to the classic model of de Gennes with static obstacles that exhibits a percolation transition, the Sokoban walker is capable of modifying its environment by pushing a few surrounding obstacles. Surprisingly, even a limited pushing ability leads to a loss of the percolation transition. Through a combination of a rigorous large-deviation calculation and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the Sokoban model belongs to the Balagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan trapping universality class. The survival probability that the walker has not yet been trapped inside a cage exhibits stretched-exponential relaxation at late times. Furthermore, using the average trap size as a proxy, we identify the emergence of a dynamical crossover at a density $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ between two qualitatively different trapping mechanisms: a self-trapping mechanism at low density, where the walker becomes dynamically localized within a self-formed trap, and a pre-existing trapping mechanism at high density, where confinement arises from the initial arrangement of obstacles. This crossover is responsible for the loss of the classical percolation transition.</p>

            <p>Lattice models are powerful tools for studying strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, but their general lack of exact solutions motivates efforts to simulate them in tunable platforms. Recently, a promising new candidate has emerged for such platforms from two-dimensional materials. A subset of moiré systems can be effectively described as a two-dimensional electron gas (2D EG) subject to a moiré potential, with electron-electron interactions screened by nearby metallic gates. In this paper, we investigate the realization of lattice models in such systems. We show that, by controlling the gate separation, a 2D EG in a square moiré potential can be systematically tuned into a system whose ground state exhibits orders analogous to those of the square lattice Hubbard model, including the stripe phase. Furthermore, we study how variations in gate separation and moiré potential depth affect the ground-state orders. A number of antiferromagnetic phases, as well as a ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase, are identified. We then apply our quantitative downfolding approach to triangular moiré systems closer to current experimental conditions, compare them with the square lattice parameters studied, and outline routes for experimental realization of the phases.</p>

            <p>Durable, high-performance and eco-friendly lead-free piezoceramics are essential for next-generation sustainable energy transducers and electromechanical systems. While significant performance enhancements have been made, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics are intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working conditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical durability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key challenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a scalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the microstructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks stacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded together by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This deliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural strength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT synthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without sacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT exhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 10- to 15-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles before failure. These gains originate from anisotropic residual stress fields, revealed by Raman spectroscopy and XRD, which delay crack initiation events. Furthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and electromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based piezoelectric transducer under bending mode. Given its non-chemical-compositional origin, this bioinspired strategy could be broadly applicable to other piezoelectric material systems for applications where both functional and structural performance are critical.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiryl Pakrouski, K. V. Samokhin</p>
            <p>Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary. Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.</p>

By aligning $|\psi|^2$ with the symmetry of the crystal field, they allow rapid determination of eigenstate structures without the need for elaborate calculations. The agreement with established results indicates that these functions capture the essential physics while offering considerable computational simplification.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilles Parez, Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p>We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full system, the RLE coincides with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leo Hahn, Arnaud Guillin, Manon Michel</p>
            <p>We exactly resolve the three-particle steady state of run-and-tumble particles with jamming interactions, providing the first microscopic description beyond two bodies. The invariant measure, derived via a piecewise-deterministic Markov process description and symmetry principles, reveals persistent, separated, and diffusive regimes ruled by the activity parameter. A geometric cascade of scales in the activity parameter organizes the structural weights, showing the separated phase dominates at finite activity, while non-uniformity plays only a minor role. Extending these results to larger systems, we show that the $N$-body steady state inherits the same organization: the number of clusters becomes sharply defined by the activity value, with crossover boundaries whose slopes diverge with $N$. We also show how the activity plays a role similar to a fugacity conjugate to cluster number, yielding a grand-canonical-like structure emerging directly from the microscopic dynamics. This framework lays the groundwork for a systematic microscopic theory of active many-body steady states.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Mpemba effect in quasiperiodic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Shujie Cheng, Gao Xianlong</p>
            <p>We study a one-dimensional quasiperiodic tight-binding model with simultaneous off-diagonal (hopping) and diagonal (onsite) modulations. Using the inverse participation ratio and the wave-packet centroid, we construct localization-delocalization phase diagrams for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states. We analyze the robustness of initial-state properties under dissipation and characterize dissipation-induced localization-delocalization transitions (and their reversals) in detail. Trace-distance dynamics provide evidence for a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared farther from the steady state can relax faster than states initialized closer to it. We propose a starting-line hypothesis that explains the presence or absence of this effect across parameter regimes. These results advance the understanding of steady-state phase transitions and relaxation dynamics in dissipatively driven quasiperiodic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Brühlmann, Yunyoung Hwang, Jorge Puebla, Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero</p>
            <p>We provide a theory of spin and acoustic wave coupled nonlinear dynamics in continuum systems. Combining the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations with the magnetoelastic Hamiltonian, we derive classical equations of motion for the magnetization and acoustic wave amplitudes, that include magnonic nonlinearity -- both three- and four-magnon processes -- as well as linear and nonlinear magnetoelastic interactions. We focus on two-dimensional magnetic films sustaining surface acoustic waves, a geometry where our model successfully reproduces our recent experimental observation of phonon-to-magnon down-conversion under acoustic drive. We provide analytical expressions for all the rates in our equations, which make them particularly suitable for quantization. We then quantize our model, deriving Heisenberg-Langevin equations of motion for magnon and phonon operators, and show how to compute quantum expectation values in the mean field approximation. Our work paves the way toward acoustic control of magnons in the quantum regime.</p>

            <h2>InSpecLearn4SDL: Interpretable Spectral Features Predict Conductivity in Self-Driving Doped Conjugated Polymer Labs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankush Kumar Mishra, Jacob P. Mauthe, Nicholas Luke, Aram Amassian, Baskar Ganapathysubramanian</p>
            <p>To accelerate materials discovery using self-driving labs (SDLs), we present a machine learning pipeline that predicts the electrical conductivity of doped conjugated polymers using rapid, non-destructive optical spectroscopy. Our approach automates spectral featurization by combining a genetic algorithm with adaptive area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations, creating a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) that links optical response and processing parameters to conductivity. By incorporating SHAP-guided selection and domain-knowledge-based feature expansion, the model matches expert-curated performance while theoretically reducing experimental effort by $\sim 33\%$ by minimizing the need for costly direct conductivity measurements. Notably, the model recovers known physical descriptors in pBTTT and identifies informative tail-state regions correlated with polymer bleaching upon successful doping. This generic, interpretable, small-data-friendly methodology can be extended to other spectroscopic modalities, such as Raman or FTIR, providing a framework for autonomous decision-making in SDLs.</p>

            <p>In this paper we introduce a theoretical model of a metallic magnetic system with noncollinear antiferromagnetic order. We introduce a mechanism of indirect interaction of conducting fermions with localized spins based on the tunneling processes of conducting fermions through the localized spins. We demonstrate that interaction of conducting fermions with noncollinear antiferromagnetic order results in odd in momentum spin-momentum locking. The interaction resembles Rashba spin-orbit coupling but breaks the time-reversal symmetry. As a result, we show that a ferromagnet with the noncollinear antiferromagnetic order is an insulator with anomalous Hall effect occurring without any spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <p>We report the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface. Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements reveal spin-dependent electron reflectivity for enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers, indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Control experiments on clean Cu(100) and TO[11]H on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite show no such effect, excluding artifacts and chirality-induced spin selectivity as origins. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with hybrid functionals attribute the magnetism to strong chemisorption, which induces hybridization between the molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface. An extended Newns-Anderson-Grimley model incorporating on-site Coulomb repulsion in Cu d-orbitals reproduces the emergence of interfacial spin polarization above a threshold interaction strength, highlighting the key roles of hybridization parameters and Coulomb correlation. These findings reveal a mechanism for inducing magnetism at molecule-metal interfaces without inherently magnetic components, offering avenues for engineering spin-polarized states in organic-inorganic hybrid systems.</p>

            <p>Embryonic healing in epithelial tissues is distinct from adult wound healing, as it lacks inflammatory responses or immune cell recruitments, making it ideal to test models of wound healing driven primarily by epithelial dynamics. Many models have been developed to describe this process, ranging from simple mechanistic models to more elaborate multiscale simulations. We review different classes of physical models, from discrete to continuum models, and how they address key questions about the mechanics, signaling, and coordination of cells during wound closure. We highlight tensions between model complexity and interpretability and discuss recent efforts to bridge gaps across scales. Finally, we identify directions for hybrid modeling and model-experiment integration that could push forward our understanding of epithelial repair in development and disease.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments support that the magic-angle graphene can be modeled by a periodic array of correlated quantum impurities, immersed in a Dirac sea. This work analytically tackles a spin-valley Anderson impurity, featuring a general (anti-)Hund's interaction ($J_D, J_S$) that can originate from electron-phonon couplings. We derive its full phase diagram, which encompasses rich continuous local phase transitions, and presents a unified origin for pairing potential and pseudogap. In particular, $J_D$ favors a valley doublet, and we show it drives a BKT transition out of heavy Fermi liquid, to an anisotropic doublet phase exhibiting a non-analytic zero-energy kink in the impurity spectral function. $J_S$ drives a second-order transition out of heavy Fermi liquid, to a local singlet phase, with a non-Fermi liquid critical point. We analyze the pairing potential across the phase diagram, and unveil their ubiquitous existence triggered by the (anti-)Hund's multiplet splitting. Crucially, we show the pseudogap shoulders in the spectral function represent multiplet excitations induced by an injected electron or hole. All results are obtained analytically, using techniques including bosonization-refermionization, with further verification by numerical renormalization group calculations. Then we derive the correlation self-energy ansatze that account for pseudogap, and apply to the magic-angle graphene lattice.</p>

            <p>Bernstein modes -- hybrid magnetoplasmon excitations arising from the coupling between cyclotron motion and collective oscillations in two-dimensional electron systems -- offer direct access to non-local electrodynamics. These modes can exhibit rich nonlinear behavior akin to strong-coupling phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but reaching nonlinear regime has remained experimentally challenging. Here we report the observation of nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene using terahertz excitation with near-field enhancement from embedded metallic contacts. Photoresistance spectroscopy reveals sharp resonances at Bc/2 and Bc/3 that saturate at radiation intensities nearly an order of magnitude lower than the cyclotron resonance. We ascribe this to strong local heating of the electron gas due to resonant excitation of high-amplitude Bernstein magnetoplasmons, associated with a combination of the field-concentration effect of the near field and plasmonic amplification that is resonantly enhanced in the region of Bernstein gaps. Polarization-resolved measurements further confirm the near-field origin: Bernstein resonances are insensitive to circular helicity but strongly depend on the angle of linear polarization, in sharp contrast to the cyclotron resonance response. Our results establish graphene as a platform for nonlinear magnetoplasmonics, opening opportunities for strong-field manipulation of collective electron dynamics, out-of-equilibrium electron transport, and solid-state analogues of cavity quantum electrodynamics.</p>

We demonstrate here efficient magnetically tunable THz amplitude control in ultrathin, exchange-biased Co/Pt/Co/IrMn spin valve. Terahertz spintronic magnetometry resolves reversible switching between parallel and antiparallel magnetization states and correlates the high- and low-emission regimes with constructive and destructive interference of charge transients generated by the inverse spin Hall effect in the Pt spacer. A residual low-emission signal is traced to spin-to-charge conversion in IrMn. Phase inversion under front- versus back-side excitation confirms the ISHE origin of the emission, while a macrospin Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert model reproduces the field dependence of its amplitude and separates layer-specific contributions. Together, these results define a wafer-compatible spin valve device architecture that enables efficient, low-field THz amplitude control.</p>

            <h2>Compatibilities and supercompatibility conditions in shape memory alloys determined from correspondence, metrics and symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cyril Cayron</p>
            <p>The phenomenological theory of martensite crystallography (PTMC) developed in the 1950s explains the main crystallographic and microstructural features of martensite in shape memory alloys, such as the habit planes of bi-variant laminate martensite product, and the transformation twins between the variants. It also permits to determine the austenite and martensite lattice parameters that allow supercompatibility, which has driven important research and development of new shape memory alloys with low hysteresis and high cyclability. Supercompatibility takes the form of three mathematical equations called cofactor conditions. The calculations are in great part based mathematical tools from continuum mechanics (polar decompositions and stretch tensors). They were recently replaced by pure crystallographic tools (metric tensors, group of symmetries and correspondence) in an alternative approach called correspondence theory (CT). The CT allows for the direct calculation of the transformation twins and their generic and non-generic characteristics. These twins ensure the compatibility at martensite/martensite (M/M) junction planes. Here, we show that the CT can also be used to determine the conditions of austenite/martensite (A/M) compatibility, and A/M/M supercompatibility.</p>

            <p>We propose and theoretically study minimal models of Néel ordered collinear (compensated) antiferromagnets that show the anomalous Hall effect. For simplicity, we first consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. We provide explicit examples of a Néel ordered ferrimagnet and a Dzyaloshinskii weak ferromagnet. Then antiferromagnet on the rutile lattice, that belongs to the class of weak ferromagnets, is studied. We analyze Dzyaloshinskii's invariants for the existence of spontaneous magnetization in these Néel ordered systems. Microscopic calculations of the Berry curvature for the studied systems confirm the validity of these Dzyaloshinskii's invariants. It is shown that the anomalous Hall effect mechanism in these antiferromagnets arises either from the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the Néel order and the spin-orbit coupling. These physical processes originate from the broken symmetries that permit the Dzyaloshinskii's invariant in the system.</p>

            <h2>Precise, efficient and flexible modeling of crystallizing elastomers based on physics-augmented neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konrad Friedrichs, Franz Dammaß, Karl A. Kalina, Markus Kästner</p>
            <p>We propose a precise and efficient physics-augmented neural network (PANN) to model strain-induced crystallization in rubbery polymers. We demonstrate that the model can be flexibly employed for both unfilled and filled natural rubber (NR). The approach is based on a two potential framework, similar to the concept of generalized standard materials (GSMs). To describe the material behavior, neural network-based free energy and dissipation potentials are employed. The evolution of crystallinity is derived from the two potentials. To ensure boundedness of the crystallinity, a novel constrained GSM-type evolution problem is proposed. To this end, two additional Lagrange multipliers together with the corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are introduced. As a result, it is guaranteed that crystallinity can be interpreted as a variable of concentration type. The neural network-based potentials ensure all physically desirable properties by construction. Most importantly, objectivity, material symmetry and thermodynamic consistency are automatically fulfilled. In addition, an alternative derivation of the governing model equations in time-discrete form is presented based on an incremental variational framework, which also serves as the basis for a finite element implementation. We demonstrate the predictive capability of the PANN using three different experimental data sets from literature, considering both stress and crystallinity evolution at material point level as well as the corresponding field distributions in a notched specimen. Moreover, we show that model parameterization is also possible when experimental crystallinity data is not available, still enabling suitable stress predictions.</p>

            <h2>Real-space formulation of the Chern invariant and topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiminori Hattori, Shinji Nakata</p>
            <p>In this paper, we formulate the real-space Chern number in a supercell framework. In this framework, the overlap matrix between two corners of the Brillouin zone (BZ) is derived from diagonalizing the real-space Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions. The pass-ordered product of overlap matrices around the BZ boundary forms a Wilson loop, and defines the Chern number in real space. It is analytically shown that the real-space Chern number is quantized at integers for large enough systems and coincides with the Bott index used in the previous studies. The formulation is greatly simplified for the former so that it makes numerical computations more efficient. The real-space formula is used to numerically elucidate topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator. The Chern insulator is modeled by dimensional extension of the Rice-Mele (RM) model consisting of two sublattices, and is disordered by including a random onsite potential. As disorder strength increases, the nontrivial-to-trivial phase transition takes place for normal disorder with no sublattice polarization. By contrast, the phase diagram is almost unaffected by polarized disorder, indicating that nontrivial topology persists against disorder. These observations are supported by the linear conductance and the density of bulk states.</p>

            <p>Among all excitonic complexes in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), dark and semi-dark trions are poised to play a stellar role in future quantum technologies due to their long lifetimes, about two orders of magnitude greater than those of their bright counterparts. In monolayer (ML) tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$), accessing these states via a suitable brightening mechanism remains challenging, specially, at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the brightening of dark trions from ML WS$_2$ over the temperature range, 83 K-115 K, enabled by localized surface plasmon modes in a disordered gold substrate. The resulting photoluminescence (PL) spectrum reveals a distinct spectral doublet with the twin peaks of semi-dark and bright trion states, separated by $\sim$ 45 meV. The origin of the semi-dark trion state lies in intervalley electron-electron scatterings, while its visibility in the PL spectrum is made possible by the enhanced out-of-plane electromagnetic field associated with plasmon localization. We also report on the negative degree of circular polarization in ML WS$_2$ at the energy of the semi-dark trion state. Our results establish a scalable plasmonic route to access valley-polarized semi-dark trions, opening new opportunities for quantum and valleytronic applications.</p>

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of solving this problem using Machine Learning models supported by LLM tools. We consider both the "lifetime" prediction of the device and the prediction of degree of its degradation at specific time intervals. We demonstrate the ability of common LLM tools (ChatGPT, DeepSeek) to suggest and justify prediction methods in a dialogue with the user under conditions of incomplete information about the physical models of PSC degradation and the influence of the environment, providing rather accurate prediction. The results cover the formation of time series of efficiency with a given architecture, calculated using various available mathematical models together with environmental characteristics archived in various meteorological databases (illumination, temperature, humidity, UV level). We conclude that ChatGPT currently has sufficient access to training samples, can suggest to PSC designer various PSC models in the literature, and has adequate solutions for predicting degradation trends.</p>

            <p>Artificially engineered lattices provide a flexible platform for reproducing and extending the electronic behavior of atomic-scale materials. Artificial graphene systems, in particular, mimic graphene-like linear dispersion with tunable Dirac cones and offer a route to realizing more exotic band structures. Here we examine the emergence of quartic energy dispersion in artificial graphene heterostructures using analytical modeling and numerical solutions of the effective Hamiltonian. We identify three distinct quartic band types: Mexican-hat-shaped (MHS), purely quartic, and non-MHS quartic bands, and determine the conditions under which each arises. We find that a staggered honeycomb lattice supports all three classes of quartic dispersion, whereas its planar counterpart yields only purely quartic and non-MHS forms. These results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering quartic band edges in artificial lattices and clarify how lattice geometry can be used to tailor their characteristics.</p>

            <p>Understanding and controlling spin dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets is essential for their application in magnonics and hybrid quantum platforms. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the vdW ferromagnet 1T-CrTe_{2} and demonstrate their systematic tunability via niobium (Nb) substitution in Cr_{1-x}Nb_{x}Te_{2}(x=0-0.2). Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy reveals that Nb doping enables wide-band tuning of the resonance frequency from 40 GHz down to the few-GHz regime, accompanied by a moderate increase in the Gilbert damping constant from ~0.066 to ~0.14, while preserving robust room-temperature ferromagnetism. Complementary magnetometry shows a concurrent reduction of the Curie temperature and saturation magnetization with increasing Nb content. Density functional theory calculations attribute the observed spin-dynamic trends to Nb-induced modifications of magnetic anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, CrTe_{2} flakes (~100nm thick) exhibit lower resonance frequencies than bulk crystals, consistent with thickness-dependent magnetic anisotropy. These results establish Nb-doped CrTe_{2} as a tunable vdW ferromagnet with controllable spin dynamics, extending its functionality from spintronics to broadband magnonics and quantum magnonics.</p>

            <p>In this work, we determine the dissociation temperature of the hydrogen (H$_2$) hydrate by computer simulation using two different methods. In both cases, the molecules of water and H$_2$ are modeled using the TIP4P/Ice and a modified version of the Silvera and Goldman models respectively, and the Berthelot combining rule for the cross water-H$_2$ interactions has been modified. The first method used in this work is the solubility method which consists in determining the solubility of H$_2$ in an aqueous phase when in contact with a H$_2$ hydrate (H--L$_{\text{w}}$) phase and when in contact with a pure H$_2$ phase (L$_{\text{w}}$--L$_{\text{H}_2}$) at different temperatures. At a given pressure value, both solubility curves intersect at the temperature ($T_3$) at which the three phases coexist in equilibrium. Following this approach, we determine the dissociation temperature of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$ finding a good agreement with the data previously reported in the literature. We also analyze the effect of the multiple occupancy of the D, or small, and H, or large, cages of the sII hydrate structure. We conclude that the $T_3$ value is barely affected by the occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$. From the analysis of the solubility curves and performing extra bulk simulations of the three phases involved in the equilibrium, we also determine the driving force for nucleation ($\Delta\mu^{\text{EC}}_{N}$) at $185\,\text{MPa}$ as a function of the supercooling degree and the H$_2$ hydrate occupancy. We determine that, thermodynamically, the most favored occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate consists of 1 H$_2$ molecule in the D cages and 3 in the H cages (named as 1-3 occupancy).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Perevertov</p>
            <p>The temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization of Ni2MnGa and other ferromagnets can be described in reduced coordinates by the superellipse equation using a single dimensionless parameter. This critical exponent parameter equals 2.4 for Ni2MnGa, 2.7 for nickel and cobalt, 3.0 for iron and 2.05 for gadolinium. Because reduced magnetization and reduced temperature enter the equation symmetrically, the Ms(T) dependence can be measured only in the low temperature range, from 0 to 0.5Tc. The magnetization curve from 0.5Tc to Tc can then be obtained by interchanging reduced magnetization and temperature in the superellipse equation. In this way, the experimentally challenging task of measuring spontaneous magnetization near Tc is avoided, as the behavior near Tc is effectively determined from measurements performed near T = 0. The Ms(T) dependence in a whole temperature range is fully determined by two parameters - the Curie temperature, Ts and the critical exponent, n.</p>

The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered, which yields a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of the absolute value of Euler characteristic in finite-size graphs near to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</p>

            <p>Strong Coulomb interactions in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors give rise to tightly bound excitons, exciton polarons, and correlated electronic phases such as Wigner crystals (WCs), yet their mutual interplay remains poorly understood. Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective. These results establish WC polarons as a new quasiparticle paradigm and introduce polaron-induced Umklapp scattering as a general route to accessing finite-momentum many-body excitations in 2D quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Additive-Functional Approach to Transport in Periodic and Tilted Periodic Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang Yang, Zhixin Peng</p>
            <p>In this Letter, we clarify the physical origin of effective transport in periodic and tilted periodic systems. When Brownian dynamics is examined on the scale of a single period, the particle displacement admits a natural separation into a bounded part associated with recurrent motion within the periodic landscape, and an unbounded stochastic part that grows in time and carries the net transport. We show that effective drift and diffusion are governed entirely by this unbounded component, while local potential-induced fluctuations contribute only bounded corrections. Treating the displacement as an additive functional of the stochastic dynamics provides a rigorous formulation of this separation and leads to a corrector-martingale representation at the trajectory level. Within this framework, classical results-including the Lifson-Jackson formula for unbiased periodic systems and the Stratonovich expressions for tilted periodic potentials-follow as direct consequences of the same underlying structure. The same perspective extends naturally to higher-dimensional periodic environments, recovering the standard homogenized transport tensors.</p>

            <h2>Recent progress on disorder-induced topological phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan-Wei Zhang, Ling-Zhi Tang</p>
            <p>Topological states of matter in disordered systems without translation symmetry have attracted great interest in recent years. These states with topological characters are not only robust against certain disorders, but also can be counterintuitively induced by disorders from a topologically trivial phase in the clean limit. In this review, we summarize the current theoretical and experimental progress on disorder-induced topological phases in both condensed-matter and artificial systems. We first introduce the topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) induced by random disorders and their topological characterizations and experimental realizations. We then discuss various extensions of TAIs with unique localization phenomena in quasiperiodic and non-Hermitian systems. We also review the theoretical and experimental studies on the disorder-induced topology in dynamical and many-body systems, including topological Anderson-Thouless pumps, disordered correlated topological insulators and average-symmetry protected topological orders acting as interacting TAI phases. Finally, we conclude the review by highlighting potential directions for future explorations.</p>

            <h2>Influence of intraspecies interactions on the diversity of the wetting phase diagram in dilute ternary Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nguyen Van Thu</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of intraspecies interactions on the structure and diversity of the wetting phase diagram in a dilute ternary Bose-Einstein condensates. Within the GP formalism, we employ the double-parabola approximation to describe the interfacial properties of the system in the limit of strong segregation between two of the components. Our analysis focuses on the static behavior near degenerate points where distinct phase boundaries intersect in the parameter space defined by the healing-length ratios. We demonstrate that the first-order and critical wetting transition lines, along with the nucleation line intersect at a unique degenerate point. This finding contrasts with previous studies in the interspecies interaction space, where two degenerate points were observed. These results provide new insights into the interfacial phase behavior of multicomponent quantum gases and offer theoretical guidance for experimental explorations of wetting phenomena in ultracold atomic systems.</p>

            <h2>Exciton-Anyon Binding in Fractional Chern Insulators: Spectral Fingerprints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianhong Lu, Luiz H. Santos</p>
            <p>Transition--metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) uniquely combine topological electronic states realized without external magnetic fields with a strong optical response arising from long--lived excitons. Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moiré TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Reich, Kiryl Piasotski, Eytan Grosfeld, Alexander Shnirman</p>
            <p>We study planar Josephson junctions formed on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator (Fu-Kane proposal) and examine the experimentally relevant parameter regimes in which the effective velocity of the emergent one-dimensional Majorana modes approaches zero. We show that the frequently employed Fu-Kane effective theory breaks down in this case. As parameters like the chemical potential or the width of the junction are tuned, instances of vanishing effective velocity mark the emergence of additional 'Dirac cones' at zero energy and finite momentum. If the junction is subjected to an external magnetic field, Josephson vortices may then bind a number of zero modes in addition to the topological Majorana mode. The additional zero modes are 'symmetry-protected' and can be lifted by a broken mirror symmetry (which is to be expected in realistic scenarios) as well as by an in-plane magnetization (or Zeeman field). We note that the ensuing presence of additional low-energy Andreev states can significantly contribute to measured quantities like the Josephson current or microwave absorption spectra.</p>

            <p>In this work, three InAs/InAs$_{0.65}$Sb$_{0.35}$ superlattices with different periods were investigated using photoluminescence and photoreflectance measurements and their band structure was simulated using a 14 bulk-band kp model. The structures were studied by analyzing the evolution of the spectral features in temperature and excitation power to determine the origin of optical transitions. After identifying which of these are related to the superlattice mini-bands, a rich collection of observed higher-order optical transitions was compared with refractive-index calculations. This procedure was used to adjust the parameters of the theoretical model, namely the bowing parameters of the InAsSb valence band offset and bandgap. It was also shown that the spectroscopy of the higher-order states combined with numerical modeling of the refractive index is a powerful tool for improvement of the material parameters, presenting a new approach to material studies of advanced semiconductor heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics. We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, microampere currents, 2 MHz speeds and ~250 fJ per nonlinear operation, with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales. We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emily Townsend, Joshua Pomeroy, Garnett W. Bryant</p>
            <p>We derive a modified Lindblad equation for the state of quantum dot tunnel coupled to a Markovian lead when the spin state of the dot is driven by an oscillating magnetic field. We show that the equation is a completely positive, trace-preserving map and find the jump operators. This is a driven-dissipative regime in which coherent driving is relevant to the tunneling and cannot be treated as simply a rotation modifying the system with a bath derived under a static magnetic field. This work was motivated by an experimental desire to determine the Zeeman splitting of an electron spin on a quantum dot (a spin qubit), and in a related work we show that this splitting energy can be found by measuring the charge occupancy of the dot while sweeping the frequency of the driving field \ arXiv:2503.17481. Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.</p>

            <p>Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</p>

            <p>Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) show evidence that they are protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.</p>

We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</p>

            <h2>Conveyor-belt superconducting quantum computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Cioni, Roberto Menta, Riccardo Aiudi, Marco Polini, Vittorio Giovannetti</p>
            <p>The processing unit of a solid-state quantum computer consists in an array of coupled qubits, each locally driven with on-chip microwave lines that route carefully-engineered control signals to the qubits in order to perform logical operations. This approach to quantum computing comes with two major problems. On the one hand, it greatly hampers scalability towards fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are estimated to need a number of qubits -- and, therefore driving lines -- on the order of $10^6$. On the other hand, these lines are a source of electromagnetic noise, exacerbating frequency crowding and crosstalk, while also contributing to power dissipation inside the dilution fridge. We here tackle these two overwhelming challenges by presenting a novel quantum processing unit (QPU) for a universal quantum computer which is globally (rather than locally) driven. Our QPU relies on a string of superconducting qubits with always-on ZZ interactions, enclosed into a closed geometry, which we dub ``conveyor belt''. Strikingly, this architecture requires only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ physical qubits to run a computation on $N$ computational qubits, in contrast to previous $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ proposals for global quantum computation. Additionally, universality is achieved via the implementation of single-qubit gates and a one-shot Toffoli gate. The ability to perform multi-qubit operations in a single step could vastly improve the fidelity and execution time of many algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential-in-volume tails</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben T. McDonough, Chao Yin, Andrew Lucas, Carolyn Zhang</p>
            <p>Lieb-Robinson bounds demonstrate the emergence of locality in many-body quantum systems. Intuitively, Lieb-Robinson bounds state that with local or exponentially decaying interactions, the correlation that can be built up between two sites separated by distance $r$ after a time $t$ decays as $\exp(vt-r)$, where $v$ is the emergent Lieb-Robinson velocity. In many problems, it is important to also capture how much of an operator grows to act on $r^d$ sites in $d$ spatial dimensions. Perturbation theory and cluster expansion methods suggest that at short times, these volume-filling operators are suppressed as $\exp(-r^d)$ at short times. We confirm this intuition, showing that for $r > vt$, the volume-filling operator is suppressed by $\exp(-(r-vt)^d/(vt)^{d-1})$. This closes a conceptual and practical gap between the cluster expansion and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We then present two very different applications of this new bound. Firstly, we obtain improved bounds on the classical computational resources necessary to simulate many-body dynamics with error tolerance $\epsilon$ for any finite time $t$: as $\epsilon$ becomes sufficiently small, only $\epsilon^{-O(t^{d-1})}$ resources are needed. A protocol that likely saturates this bound is given. Secondly, we prove that disorder operators have volume-law suppression near the "solvable (Ising) point" in quantum phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking, which implies a new diagnostic for distinguishing many-body phases of quantum matter.</p>

            <p>We show that a simple nonlinear differential equation (originally studied in the physics of disordered systems) is able to mathematically describe the global population growth over the past 12000 years. Different regimes of population growth since the early Neolithic until today are shown to be all solutions to the same nonlinear differential equation in its various limits. These also include the well-known Malthus (exponential) and Verhulst (logistic) growth regimes, as well as von Foerster's ``doomsday'' formula. All these limits correspond to neglecting higher-order terms in a more general nonlinear dynamic model described by the proposed nonlinear differential equation. While the older models may provide valid fittings to limited time intervals in the global population growth curve in time, their clearly approximate nature prevents them from being predictive over longer periods of time. The proposed comprehensive solution of the proposed model is instead well suited to provide predictions for future scenarios. These include halving of the global population as early as 2064 due to resource depletion, if the effect of the Earth's limited carrying capacity were to set in today.</p>

            <p>We present a universal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating arbitrary high-spin (spin greater than 1/2) Hamiltonians, based on the recently developed permutation matrix representation (PMR) framework. Our approach extends a previously developed PMR-QMC method for spin-1/2 Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013281 (2024)]. Because it does not rely on a local bond decomposition, the method applies equally well to models with arbitrary connectivities, long-range and multi-spin interactions, and its closed-walk formulation allows a natural analysis of sign-problem conditions in terms of cycle weights. To demonstrate its applicability and versatility, we apply our method to spin-1 and spin-3/2 quantum Heisenberg models on the square lattice, as well as to randomly generated high-spin Hamiltonians. Additionally, we show how the approach naturally extends to general Hamiltonians involving mixtures of particle species, including bosons and fermions.

Superconducting microwave resonators provide highly efficient storage, long coherence times, on-demand reading and even in memory pulse engineering, but it is still challenging to overcome design and materials induced loss channels for on-chip realization. In this work, we present a novel architecture of integrated superconducting quantum memory with a dynamically controlled RF-SQUID coupling element in pulse regime, thus ensuring high efficiency storage and cycling storage time. It demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and 57.5% storage fidelity with preservation of the stored pulse shape during the retrieval at single-photon level excitations. We establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching and materials imperfections. Still the device was used only for storing finite-duration near-single-photon classical microwave pulses, we assert that it operates as a linear device when the photon population in the common resonator remains low so it should be compatible with quantum state this http URL proposed architecture highlights a disruptive potential for on-chip qubit and memory integration for scalable quantum error correction, while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avik Chakraborty, Manavendra Mahato</p>
            <p>The chiral SYK model is an 1+1 dimensional generalisation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with chiral Majorana fermions and homogeneous random interactions. In the large N limit, the model admits an exact solution of the two-point function due to its scaling symmetry and exhibits a quantised thermal Hall conductance consistent with that of a 2+1 dimensional gapped topological system. We study two chiral SYK systems coupled by a relevant quadratic interaction that explicitly breaks scaling and time reversal symmetry. Working in the regime of weak intersystem coupling, we solve the Dyson-Schwinger equations perturbatively and obtain analytic expressions for two-point functions at finite temperature. Unlike the coupled SYK model in 0+1 dimensions, the 1+1 dimensional chiral system does not develop a mass gap, and no thermal phase transition is observed. We show that the leading correction to the thermodynamic free energy is temperature-independent, implying that the entropy density remains identical to that of two uncoupled chiral SYK systems. A real-time analysis of the retarded correlator reveals the emergence of massless collective bosonic modes propagating between the two subsystems at zero temperature, signalling quasiparticle tunnelling without gap generation. Our results demonstrate a sharp qualitative distinction between relevant deformations of SYK models in zero and one spatial dimensions, and highlight the robustness of gapless chiral edge dynamics against explicit scaling symmetry-breaking interactions.</p>

Although the SAXS data is averaged over time and all spatial orientations of the molecules, for sequences which have some asymmetry in the data we show that the conformations can be oriented with respect to the sequence. This allows specific features detected by the analysis to be precisely related to the DNA sequence, opening up new opportunities for SAXS to investigate the properties of DNA in solution. The biological implications of these results are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saptarshi Mandal, Pieter W. Claeys, Sthitadhi Roy</p>
            <p>Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.</p>

            <p>We investigate dissipation-driven topological phase transitions in one-dimensional quantum open systems governed by the Lindblad equation with linear dissipation operators, which ensure the density matrix retains its Gaussian form throughout the dynamics. By employing the modular Hamiltonian framework, we rigorously demonstrate that the $\rm{Z}_2$ topological invariant characterizing steady states in one-dimensional class D systems is exclusively dependent on the dissipation operators, rather than the system Hamiltonian. Through a sudden quench protocol where the system evolves from the steady state of one Lindbladian to another, we reveal that topological transitions can occur at analytically predictable critical times, even when the initial and final steady states share identical topological indices. These transitions are shown, both analytically and numerically, to depend solely on dissipation parameters. Entanglement spectrum analysis demonstrates bulk-edge correspondence in non-equilibrium density matrices via coexisting single-particle gap closures (periodic boundaries) and topologically protected zero modes (open boundaries), directly underpinning the detection of dissipation-induced topology in quantum simulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Thériault, Daniele Tantari</p>
            <p>Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related to cutting edge machine learning paradigms, such as the attention mechanism and generative diffusion. We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.</p>

            <p>We study a mean-field model for a system of 2D abelian anyons, given by the dynamics of a Schr{ö}dinger matter field coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. We derive an effective 1D equation by adding a strongly anisotropic trapping potential (wave-guide) acting on the Schr{ö}dinger field, and tracing out the tight confinement direction. The effective dynamics in the loose direction of the wave-guide turns out to be governed by the classical 1D quintic NLS equation.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating the Limits of QAOA Parameter Transfer at High-Rounds on Sparse Ising Models With Geometrically Local Cubic Terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah Pelofske, Marek Rams, Andreas Bärtschi, Piotr Czarnik, Paolo Braccia, Lukasz Cincio, Stephan Eidenbenz</p>
            <p>The emergent practical applicability of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for approximate combinatorial optimization is a subject of considerable interest. One of the primary limitations of QAOA is the task of finding a set of good parameters. Parameter transfer is a phenomenon where QAOA angles trained on problem instances that are self-similar tend to perform well for other problem instances from that similar class. This suggests a potentially highly efficient and scalable non-variational learning method for QAOA angle finding. We systematically study QAOA parameter transferability from small problems (16, 27 qubits) onto large problem instances (up to 156 qubits) for heavy-hex graph Ising models with geometrically local higher order terms using the Julia based QAOA simulation tool JuliQAOA to perform classical angle finding for up to 49 QAOA layers. Parameter transfer of the fixed angles is validated using a combination of full statevector, Projected Entangled Pair States, Matrix Product State, and LOWESA numerical simulations. We find that the QAOA parameter transfer from single instances applied to unseen problem instances does not in general provide monotonically improving performance as a function of p - there are many cases where the performance temporarily decreases as a function of p - but despite this the transferred angles have a general trend of improved expectation value as the QAOA depth increases, in many cases converging close to the true ground-state energy of the 100+ qubit instances. We also sample the hardware-compatible Ising models using the ensemble of fixed QAOA angles on several superconducting qubit IBM Quantum processors with 127, 133, and 156 qubits. We find continuous solution quality improvement of the hardware-compatible QAOA circuits run on the IBM NISQ processors up to p=5 on ibm_fez, p=9 on ibm_torino, and p=10 on ibm_pittsburgh.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Benini, Pasquale Calabrese, Michele Fossati, Amartya Harsh Singh, Marco Venuti</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is an observable in quantum systems, constructed using quantum-information methods, suited to detecting symmetry breaking in states -- possibly out of equilibrium -- relative to a subsystem. In this paper we define the asymmetry for generalized finite symmetries, including higher-form and noninvertible ones. To this end, we introduce a "symmetrizer" of (reduced) density matrices with respect to the $C^*$-algebra of symmetry operators acting on the subsystem Hilbert space. We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Rodrigues, F. J. Galindo-Rosales, L. Campo-Deaño</p>
            <p>A microfluidic approach to probing the first normal stress difference from single-point pressure measurements in transient shear flows is presented. Using an original experimental design, we examine the near-zero-mean pulsatile flow of polymeric solutions in a straight microchannel at low Reynolds and Womersley numbers. An important aspect of this work is that the enhanced fluid elastic stresses can be efficiently determined via the pressure shift measured from pressure-controlled pulsatile shear experiments. We find a scaling law that collapses pressure-shift data from viscoelastic fluids of different molecular weights onto a single master curve that can then be used to predict this phenomenology. Taken together, these results could help shed light on our understanding of the non-linear normal stress responses in time-dependent flows.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brenden Roberts, Jin Ming Koh, Yi Tan, Norman Y. Yao</p>
            <p>The existence of self-correcting quantum memories in three dimensions is a long-standing open question at the interface between quantum computing and many-body physics. We take the perspective that large contributions to the entropy arising from fine-tuned spatial symmetries, including the assumption of an underlying regular lattice, are responsible for fundamental challenges to realizing self-correction. Accordingly, we introduce a class of disordered quantum codes, which we call "cored product codes". These codes are derived from classical factors via the hypergraph product but undergo a coring procedure which allows them to be embedded in a lower number of spatial dimensions while preserving code properties. As a specific example, we focus on a fractal code based on the aperiodic pinwheel tiling as the classical factor and perform finite temperature numerical simulations on the resulting three-dimensional quantum memory. We provide evidence that, below a critical temperature, the memory lifetime increases with system size for codes up to 60000 qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Izzatjon Allayarov, Andrey B. Evlyukhin, Antonio Calà Lesina</p>
            <p>Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.</p>

The spin chain is non-unitary but PT-symmetric and, in addition to chaos, exhibits an interesting transition after which the eigenvalues become complex.</p>

            <p>We engineer lumped-element superconducting resonators that maximize magnetic coupling to molecular spin qubits, achieving record single-spin couplings up to $100$ kHz and collective couplings exceeding $10$ MHz. The resonators interact with PTMr organic free radicals, model spin systems with $S=1/2$ and a quasi-isotropic $g \simeq 2$, dispersed in polymer matrices. The highest collective spin-photon coupling strengths are attained with resonators having large inductors, which therefore interact with most spins in the molecular ensemble. By contrast, the coupling of each individual spin $G_{1}$ is maximized in resonators having a minimum size inductor, made of a single wire. The same platform has been used to study spin relaxation and spin coherent dynamics in the dispersive regime, when spins are energetically detuned from the resonator. We find evidences for the Purcell effect, i.e. the photon induced relaxation of those spins that are most strongly coupled to the circuit. The rate of this process gives access to the distribution of single spin photon couplings in a given device. For resonators with a $50$ nm wide constriction at the inductor center, single maximum $G_{1}$ values reach $\sim 100$ kHz. Pumping the spins with strong pulses fed through an independent transmission line induces coherent Rabi oscillations. The spin excitation then proceeds via either direct resonant processes induced by the main pulse frequency or, in the case of square-shaped pulses, via the excitation of the cavity by sideband frequency components. The latter process measures the cavity mode hybridization with the spins and can be eliminated by using Gaussian shaped pulses. These results establish a scalable route toward integrated molecular-spin quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement as a Cohomological Obstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Ikeda</p>
            <p>We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental validation. Detailed numerical implementations for concrete quantum many-body models are presented in the companion paper \cite{2026arXiv260113467I}.</p>

            <p>Strongly-confined perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) offer opportunities not found in conventional isotropic nanocubes, especially in producing linearly polarized light, as well as enhancing outcoupling through control over the transition dipole moment. But this requires ultrathin nanoplatelets with three or fewer monolayers of PbI6 octahedra across the thickness, which are challenging to synthesise uniformly, and their luminescence is strongly affected by surface defects. Together, these limit the performance of ultrathin PeNPLs in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. We demonstrate that ligands with phosphoryl functional groups strongly bind to the perovskite surface, while having an organic backbone that is not sterically bulky ensures high ligand density. By modulating nucleation and growth, these ancillary ligands lead to monodisperse PeNPLs that stack more uniformly when self-assembled into superlattices, with suppressed agglomeration. As a result, from edge-up PeNPL superlattices, we achieve enhanced degree of polarization, while from face-down PeNPL superlattices, we achieve enhanced outcoupling that results in LEDs with 13.1% external quantum efficiency, the highest reported for ultrathin PeNPL LEDs. This work establishes ancillary ligand-induced synthesis as a decisive route to achieve uniform nanoplatelets with robust orientation control, enabling full utilization of the multifunctionality of anisotropic PeNPLs.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic reconnection as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: The topological origin of Bohm resistivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magnus F Ivarsen</p>
            <p>The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta \propto T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the ensemble of electron gyro-axes in a magnetized plasma as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the mean magnetic field. Unlike stochastic turbulence models, this framework predicts a coherent, explosive onset of resistivity that naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. We support this thesis with renormalization group theory and a novel analysis of Magnetospheric Multiscale mission data, which reveals an explosive phase space confinement consistent with collective phase slippage rather than chaotic scattering. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</p>

Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.</p>

Bromide co-adsorbates play a decisive role by guiding molecular alignment, inducing surface atom displacements, and enabling transient adsorption geometries that activate otherwise Raman-inactive vibrational modes. In the absence of bromide, distinct excitation pathways emerge, reflecting competition between optomechanical coupling and charge-transfer processes associated with molecular polarization along the optical field or orientation relative to the metal surface. These results establish molecular optomechanics as a sensitive probe of surface-molecule interactions and demonstrate how anion-mediated surface dynamics regulate energy flow at plasmonic interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiyi Pan, Jaroslav Fabian</p>
            <p>The Edelstein effect, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and is therefore highly promising for future spintronic devices, can be realized and non-volatilely manipulated in ferroelectric materials owing to their broken inversion symmetry and switchable polarization states. To date, most ferroelectric systems reported to exhibit the Edelstein effect are semiconductors, requiring extrinsic doping for functionality. In contrast, the Edelstein effect has rarely been reported in metallic ferroelectric systems, where doping is unnecessary. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that a pronounced Edelstein effect can be realized in the recently proposed intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$ monolayer, where the sign of the Edelstein coefficient is coupled to the direction of ferroelectric polarization through the polarization-switching-induced reversal of spin textures, thereby enabling non-volatile control of charge-spin conversion. The Edelstein effect reaches a magnitude of $10^{11}~\hbar/(\textup{A} \cdot \textup{cm})$, which is sizable compared to previously reported ferroelectric systems. Microscopically, the Edelstein effect in a PtBi$_2$ monolayer originates from competing contributions of inner Rashba-like electron pockets and outer hole pockets with opposite signs; an upward shift of the Fermi level alters their balance and can reverse the sign of the Edelstein effect. Upon applying biaxial strain, the Fermi-surface electronic structure is strongly modified, resulting in a pronounced change of the Edelstein effect: a 2 \% compressive strain suppresses the Edelstein effect by about 50 \%. Our results not only identify a promising material platform for tunable charge-spin conversion but also provide new insights into the functional potential of metallic ferroelectric systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hriticka Dhiman, Soniya Chaudhary</p>
            <p>An analytical model is developed to investigate the interaction of quasi longitudinal (qP) waves with a perfectly bonded interface between a thermo piezoelectric half space and a functionally graded piezoelectric half space. The formulation is based on the fractional order Lord Shulman generalized thermoelasticity theory, which provides an enhanced description of coupled thermo electro mechanical wave behaviour. Rotational effects are incorporated into the constitutive relations and equations of motion for both media, while the lower half space is assumed to be subjected to initial stress. Closed form solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained, together with associated energy partition factors, allowing a comprehensive assessment of interface wave characteristics. Numerical simulations carried out using MATLAB demonstrate that the reflection and transmission responses are strongly influenced by initial stress, fractional order parameter, and thermal relaxation time. The calculated energy ratios of scattered waves satisfy the energy conservation condition, confirming the mathematical consistency of the formulation. The findings of this study are relevant to the design and analysis of smart sensors, rotating and aerospace structures, vibration control systems, and energy harvesting devices employing functionally graded thermo piezoelectric materials under fractional order effects.</p>

In this paper, we use recently-developed tensor network methods to study several examples of such theories via their Hamiltonian lattice descriptions. Our lattice results agree with all previously-made predictions. Furthermore, we identify the lattice strong-coupling states that can be adiabatically continued to the degenerate vacua in the continuum limit. We conjecture a procedure, referred to as a lattice decay rule, for how this identification works in general. This rule allows us to compute the continuum vacuum degeneracy by studying the lattice Hamiltonian in the strong-coupling limit.</p>

These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arisa Ikeda, Akitada Sakurai, Kae Nemoto, Mayu Muramatsu</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous valley Hall dynamics of exciton-polaritons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingzhou Chen, Yuanjun Guan, Areg Ghazaryan, Shiran Sun, Lingxiao Yu, Ruitao Lv, Artem Volosniev, Zheng Sun, Jian Wu</p>
            <p>The valley degree of freedom in atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides provides a natural binary index for information processing. Exciton-polaritons formed under strong light-matter coupling offer a promising route to overcome the limited lifetime and transport of bare valley excitons. Here we report an anomalous optical valley Hall effect in a monolayer WS2 exciton-polariton system. Using polarization- and time-resolved real-space imaging, we directly visualize a symmetry-breaking spatial separation of polaritons from opposite valleys under linearly polarized excitation, accompanied by an ultrafast Hall drift velocity on the order of 10^5 m/s. This behaviour cannot be accounted for by conventional cavity-induced mechanisms and instead points to a strain-induced synthetic pseudomagnetic field acting on the excitonic component of polaritons. Our results establish exciton-polaritons as a high-speed and optically accessible platform for valley transport, opening pathways towards tunable valleytronic and topological photonic devices.</p>

            <h2>Intertwined Charge Stripes and Majorana Zero Modes in An Iron-Based Superconductor</h2>

            <p>In type-II superconductors, magnetic fields modulate the amplitude and phase of the superconducting order parameter, forming quantized vortices where superconductivity is locally suppressed and exotic bound states or competing electronic orders emerge. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on epitaxial Ba(Fe$_{0.94}Co$_{0.06})$_2$As$_2$ films, we discover an incommensurate charge-stripe order aligned with the Fe-Fe bond direction and nucleated inside magnetic vortices. These charge modulations intensify at the vortex core, extend far into the vortex halo, and persist within the superconducting gap. Strikingly, the charge order modulates Andreev bound states of vortices at non-zero energies, producing abelian vortices with half-odd-integer level quantization and non-abelian vortices with integer-quantized core states that host a Majorana zero mode. The distinct vortex types are distinguished by the registry of their centers relative to the charge-stripe pattern and remain robust in ultrathin (2.5-unit-cell) films. Our findings reveal a density-wave-textured vortex matter and provide fresh insights into the intertwined phenomena of charge-stripe order, pair-density-wave modulations, and Majorana physics in iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <p>Graphene enables precise carrier-density control via gating, making it an ideal platform for studying electronic interactions. However, sample inhomogeneities often limit access to the low-density regimes where these interactions dominate. Enhancing carrier mobility is therefore crucial for exploring fundamental properties and developing device applications. Here, we demonstrate a significant reduction in external inhomogeneity using a double-layer graphene architecture separated by an ultra-thin hexagonal boron nitride layer. Mutual screening between the layers reduces scattering from random Coulomb potentials, resulting in a quantum mobility exceeding. Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations emerge at magnetic fields below 1 mT, while integer quantum Hall features are observed at 0.002T. Furthermore, we identify a fractional quantum Hall plateau at a filling factor of at 2T. These results demonstrate the platform's suitability for investigating strongly correlated electronic phases in graphene-based heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Electric-Switchable Chiral Magnons in PT-Symmetric Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinyang Ni, Congzhe Yan, Peiyuan Cui, Zhijun Jiang, Yuanjun Jin, Guoqing Chang</p>
            <p>The magnons in antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs) exhibit dual chirality, each carrying opposite spin angular momentum. However, in AFIs that are protected by PT symmetry, the magnon bands remain degenerate. In this work, we introduce a new class of PT - preserving AFIs in which the giant chiral splitting of magnons can be induced and reversibly controlled by an external electric field. Unlike ordinary cases, such AFIs host a hidden dipole coupled to the antiferromagnetic order, which allows an external electric field to break the magnon sublattice symmetry and thereby largely lift the band degeneracy. Through group theory analysis, we identify the possible magnetic layer groups that support electric-field-induced magnon band splitting. Promisingly, by density-functional- theory and spin wave calculations, the magnon band splitting of Cr2CBr2 reach up to 27meV induced by an electric field of 0.2V/Å, equivalent to the 230T under a uniform magnetic field. In addition, since chiral splitting is directly coupled to the electric field, the corresponding magnon-mediated spin current can be switched by the electric field. Our Letter opens a door for developing electric-field-controlled spintronics based on the magnons.</p>

            <h2>Facile Optimization of Combinatorial Sputtering Processes with Arbitrary Numbers of Components for Targeted Compositions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shelby Sutton Fields, Christopher David White, Keith Knipling, Steven Bennett</p>
            <p>Combinatorial sputtering is a physical vapor deposition method that enables the high-throughput synthesis of compositionally varied thin films. Using this technique, the effects of stoichiometry on specific properties of alloy thin films with analog composition gradients can be mapped using high-throughput characterization. To obtain specific stoichiometries, such as those desired for an equiatomic, intermetallic, or doped compounds, the sputter power of each target must be simultaneously tuned to optimize the deposition rate of each component. This optimization problem increases in complexity with the number of components, which commonly leads to iterative guess-and-check processing and can limit the intrinsic high-throughput advantages of this synthesis method. To circumvent this challenge, this work introduces a composition optimization procedure that enables the facile synthesis of sputtered combinatorial films with targeted compositions. This procedure leverages the expeditious mapping of composition using wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence and is capable of optimizing processing for an arbitrary number of components. As a demonstration, this method is leveraged to sputter a combinatorial Cr$_{v}$Fe$_{w}$Mo$_{x}$Nb$_{y}$Ta$_{z}$ film with an equiatomic composition near the wafer center.</p>

            <p>We show that a propagating Dirac electron with intrinsic spin generically carries a real--space helical conserved current, even in the absence of orbital angular momentum. Using exact Dirac eigenstates in cylindrical confinement, we demonstrate that this helical structure possesses definite handedness, persists into evanescent regions, and is characterized by a geometric helix pitch independent of the longitudinal de~Broglie wavelength. This intrinsic helical geometry enables a local geometric coupling between a propagating electron and a chiral environment, yielding chirality--dependent spin selectivity through current geometry rather than through a spin--orbit coupling term.</p>

            <p>We report a detailed investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and dielectric properties of polycrystalline LaV$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_4$ samples, prepared at two sintering temperatures (1000\degree C and 1250\degree C). The introduction of Nb$^{5+}$ at the V$^{5+}$ site leads to notable structural and vibrational changes, which can be attributed to their isoelectronic nature and the comparatively larger ionic radius of Nb$^{5+}$. The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns confirms a coexistence of monoclinic ($P$2$_{1}$/$n$) and scheelite-type tetragonal ($I$4$_{1}$/$a$) phases; for example, with a fraction of 4\% and 96\% for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C. The particle morphology has altered from spherical (1000\degree C) to irregular-shaped (1250\degree C) as a result of increase in annealing temperature. The Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy have been used to understand the vibrational and electronic properties. An optical band gap of 2.7~eV for the sample sintered at 1250\degree C is calculated using Ultraviolet-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The dielectric studies shows the higher dielectric permittivity ($\epsilon$$_{r}$) and lower dielectric loss for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C.</p>

            <p>To achieve room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new FMI phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our study reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katherine A. Koch, Carlos Silva-Acuña, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada</p>
            <p>Excitons and their correlated complexes underpin the rich photophysics of quantum-confined semiconductors. Among these, biexcitons -- bound states of two electrons and two holes -- provide a sensitive probe of Coulomb correlations, exciton-exciton interactions, and the role of the dielectric environment. In Ruddlesden-Popper metal halide materials (RPMHs), strong quantum and dielectric confinement stabilize excitons with binding energies of hundreds of meV, creating an ideal platform for multi-exciton phenomena. Conventional linear spectroscopies, such as photoluminescence and transient absorption, reveal biexciton signatures but suffer from spectral congestion and reabsorption artifacts. Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopies, particularly two-quantum (2Q) multidimensional techniques, uniquely access multi-exciton coherences and provide unambiguous estimates of biexciton binding energies. This minireview surveys the spectroscopic evidence for biexcitons in RPMHs, highlights the advantages of nonlinear multidimensional approaches, and situates biexciton physics within the broader context of excitonic materials, including GaAs quantum wells, quantum dots, and transition-metal dichalcogenides. By emphasizing the interplay of exciton-exciton annihilation, excitation-induced dephasing, and biexciton formation, we argue that multidimensional coherent spectroscopy offers the most reliable pathway to disentangle many-body interactions in quantum-well derivatives of metal-halide perovskites.</p>

            <h2>Transition in Splitting Probabilities of Quantum Walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prashant Singh, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai</p>
            <p>We investigate the splitting probability of a monitored continuous-time quantum walk with two targets and show that, in stark contrast to a classical random walk, it exhibits a nonanalytic, phase-transition-like behavior controlled by the sampling time at the targets. For large systems and sampling times smaller than a critical value $\tau_c = 2\pi/\Delta E$, where $\Delta E$ is the energy bandwidth, the splitting probability is universal and equal to $1/2$, independent of the initial condition and the sampling time. Above the critical sampling, a nonuniversal regime emerges in which the splitting probability deviates from $1/2$ and develops a fluctuating pattern of pronounced peaks and dips dependent on both the sampling time and the initial condition. These results follow from a nontrivial mapping of the splitting problem onto a pair of single-target detection problems enabled by the superposition principle.</p>

            <h2>Langevin equations with non-Gaussian thermal noise: Valid but superfluous</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex V. Plyukhin</p>
            <p>We discuss the statistics of additive thermal (internal) noise in systems governed by the generalized Langevin equation with linear dissipation. To assess the equation's validity, it is common to assume that the system is ergodic and to verify that solutions approach correct equilibrium values at asymptotically long times. In this paper, we instead consider the consistency of the generalized Langevin equation with the Jarzynski equality at finite times and do not assume the system's ergodicity. Specifically, we consider a classical Brownian oscillator whose initial stiffness, or frequency, is perturbed by a rectangular pulse of duration $\tau$. We find that the Jarzynski equality is satisfied unconditionally only up to the seventh order in $\tau$; in higher orders, the Jarzynski equality holds if and only if the noise is Gaussian. These results imply that, unless it is exact, the Langevin equation can only be used to evaluate properties that are linear or quadratic in noise and its derivatives. Such properties are insensitive to the noise statistics, so the Langevin equation with linear dissipation and non-Gaussian noise (though not inconsistent by itself) is superfluous.</p>

            <p>In this work, we combine coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations and mean-field theory to study supercoiling dynamics, as well as the steady-state profiles of twist and writhe, in an open DNA polymer where one of the free ends is subjected to a constant torque. Even though the other end is free, and hence can spin and release torsional stress, we observe that the entire chain transitions between a swollen and a plectonemic phase as the torque increases beyond a critical threshold. In the plectonemic phase, we observe a non-linear twist profile in the steady state, resulting from the mutual interconversion between the injected twist and geometrical writhe, which distributes inhomogeneously along the chain. We also show that the non-equilibrium dynamics of twist accumulation is diffusive, and that writhe diffusion is negligible in this geometry, as plectonemes remain localised near the end that is being rotated. We discuss the feasibility of testing our results with single-molecule experiments.</p>

            <p>Consistent with prior qualitative expectations for group IV-VI topological crystalline insulators, this work demonstrates, based on band structure and Chern number calculations, that Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se/(PbSe)$_{1-y}$(EuS)$_y$ quantum wells constitute a promising and viable platform for realizing a variety of quantum anomalous Hall phases. The proposed basis transformation procedure for the multiband $\mathit{k} \cdot \mathit{p}$ Hamiltonian enables the treatment of wells grown along arbitrary crystallographic directions while explicitly accounting for the anisotropy of the material's isoenergetic surfaces. Numerical studies of $\langle 111\rangle$-, $\langle 110\rangle$- and $\langle 001\rangle$-oriented quantum wells predict attainable Chern numbers with magnitudes ranging from $1$ to $4$, depending on the quantum well width, Sn content, and relative orientation of the four projected $\mathrm{L}$ valleys with respect to the growth direction. The results further indicate that appropriate strain compensation is required to achieve high-quality quantization of the Hall conductance.</p>

            <p>Strongly-correlated fermion systems on a lattice have been a subject of intense focus in the field of condensed-matter physics. These systems are notoriously difficult to solve, even with state-of-the-art numerical methods, especially in regimes of parameters where degrees of freedom compete or cooperate at similar energy and length scales. Here, we introduce a spin-1 slave-particle technique to approximately treat the t-U-V-J fermionic model at arbitrary electron dopings in an economical manner. This formalism respectively maps the original charge and spin degrees of freedom into effective pseudo-spin and pseudo-fermion sectors, which are treated using a self-consistent cluster mean-field method. We study the phase diagram of the model under various conditions and report the appearance of charge and spin stripes within this formalism. These stripes are a consequence of the cluster mean-field treatment of the pseudo-particle sectors and have not been detected in previous slave-particle studies. The results obtained agree qualitatively well with what more reliable numerical methods capture.</p>

            <h2>A saturation bound for cumulative responses under local linear relaxation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjeev Kumar Verma</p>
            <p>Saturation of cumulative observables is widely observed in systems with propagating or spreading signals and is commonly modeled using system-specific mechanisms such as scattering statistics, coherence functions, or phenomenological decay laws. This work shows that such saturation follows directly from linear local relaxation alone. Any linear observable accumulated over the lifetime of a relaxing signal is bounded by a scale set by the relaxation time, independent of geometry, dimensionality, or microscopic dynamics. When relaxation is mapped to space through transport or spreading, this temporal bound yields a corresponding spatial saturation scale. A closed-form expression reveals a two-regime behavior: linear growth at short times followed by saturation beyond the relaxation time. The result provides a minimal and unified explanation for cumulative saturation across transport, diffusive, and stochastic systems.</p>

Large amplitude of the predicted effect may compensate for the smallness of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, making the equilibrium spin currents to be experimentally observed. We suggest that external electric field can play the role of effective flux magnons interact with and propose an experiment based on the interference of magnons in the ring geometry as a verification of the concept.</p>

            <p>Fluctuations are an intrinsic feature of many-body systems, and their full statistical distributions reveal a wealth of information about the underlying physics. Of particular interest are non-Gaussian, extreme-value statistics that arise when nontrivial correlations and criticality dominate over the central limit theorem. Strikingly, in two-dimensional (2D) quantum fluids, such effects have been predicted to manifest in the order parameter distribution in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) superfluid phase, which approaches a universal extreme-value form in the low-temperature limit. Here, we measure the order parameter statistics of 2D Bose gases across the BKT critical point using matter-wave interferometry. This allows us to confirm the predicted convergence of the observed statistics to a universal Gumbel distribution at low temperatures, to the 0.1% level of the probability density. Furthermore, the intrinsic precision of the atom interferometer allows the robust extraction of higher-moment observables such as skewness and kurtosis; in particular, we report direct measurements of the Binder cumulant which allows us to precisely identify the onset of the phase transition. Extending this approach to the investigation of non-equilibrium systems, we probe vortex unbinding dynamics following a quench across the BKT critical point and identify parameter-independent scaling behaviour of higher moments.</p>

            <p>Error mitigation (EM) methods are crucial for obtaining reliable results in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, where noise significantly impacts output accuracy. Some EM protocols are particularly efficient for specific types of noise. Yet the noise in the actual hardware may not align with that. In this article, we introduce Noise Tailoring (NT) -- an innovative strategy designed to modify the structure of the noise associated with two-qubit gates through statistical sampling. We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates. At the same time, on actual IBM quantum computers, the NT method falls victim to various small error sources beyond Markovian Pauli noise. We propose to use the NT method for characterizing such error sources on quantum computers in order to inform hardware development.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Barthel</p>
            <p>Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D>1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.</p>

            <p>The design of spacecraft thermal protection systems (TPS) requires accurate knowledge of thermal transport properties across wide ranges of temperature and pressure. For fibrous insulation, conventional measurement techniques in laboratory settings are typically limited to temperatures much lower than what is reached in atmosphere entry scenarios. Moreover, it is often the case that only temperature measurements are available, meaning that the thermal conductivity of the insulation must be indirectly inferred as an inverse problem. We propose a Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) to reconstruct the thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse experimental data. Under IFT, the conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, and the physics is enforced via a physics-informed prior over the temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces an infinite-dimensional posterior distribution that quantifies uncertainty about the conductivity which can be evaluated in extrapolation regimes. We apply the method to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with both synthetic and experimental data to reconstruct the thermal conductivity beyond the experimental regime. The inferred conductivities are validated against reference data and then propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories. The results show that IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust TPS sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement.</p>

            <h2>Dissipative Quantum Dynamics in Static Network with Different Topologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Yang Liu, Hsuan-Wei Lee</p>
            <p>We investigate the dissipative dynamics of quantum population and coherence among different network topologies of a quantum network using a quantum spin model coupled to a thermal bosonic reservoir. Our study proceeds in two parts. First, we analyze a small network of Ising spins embedded in a large dissipative bath, modeled via the Lindblad master equation, where temperature arises naturally from system-bath coupling. This approach reveals how network topology shapes quantum dissipative dynamics, providing a basis for controlling quantum coherence through tailored network structures. Second, we propose a mean-field approach that extends the network to larger scales and captures dissipative dynamics in large-scale networks, connecting network topology to quantum coherence in complex systems and revealing the sensitivity of quantum coherence to network structure. Our results highlight how dissipative quantum dynamics depend on network topology, providing insight into the coherent dynamics of entangled states in networks. These results may be extended to dynamics in complex systems such as opinion propagation in social models, epidemiology, and various condensed-phase and biological systems.</p>

            <h2>Interaction between cell membranes and protein inclusions in the large-deformation regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaetano Ferraro, Michele Castellana</p>
            <p>Biological membranes are dynamic surfaces whose shape and function are critically influenced by protein inclusions (PIs). While membrane deformations induced by PIs have been extensively studied in the small-deformation regime, a variety of processes involves strong membrane deformations. We investigate the interaction between lipid membranes and PIs in the large deformation (LD) regime, with the finite-element method. We develop an approximate analytical solution that captures key features of the LD regime. We show that the force exerted by the membrane on a PI displays a non-monotonic behavior with respect to the PI vertical displacement. The qualitative features of this force appear to be independent of the protein geometry. For two interacting PIs, the membrane-mediated potential exhibits sub-power-law decay with inter-protein distance, reflecting the complex nature of the elastic medium. The interaction potential shows that conical PIs with identical and opposite orientations repel and attract, respectively, confirming the analogy between PI orientation and electric charge, in the LD regime. In the presence of membrane flows, we identify a characteristic velocity that separates two regimes in which bending rigidity and viscous effects dominate, respectively, implying the onset of flow-induced deformations above such velocity threshold. Overall, our results provide quantitative predictions for membrane-protein systems in biologically relevant scenarios involving LDs, with implications for protein sorting, clustering, and membrane trafficking.</p>

            <p>Surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) resonators operating at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies are widely used in wireless telecommunication and quantum information processing. Successful implementation of such resonators calls for detailed microscopic understanding of their mode profiles, energy dissipation channels, and imperfections from microfabrication. In this work, we report on the visualization of acoustic waves in LiNbO3 SAW resonators by transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy (TMIM). The Gaussian mode profile tightly confined by reflecting mirrors is vividly seen in the TMIM images, from which the linewidth of the resonator itself can be extracted. The spatially resolved acoustic profile also allows us to perform failure analysis on faulty devices. Our work establishes a pathway for further optimization of SAW resonators for classical and quantum acoustic applications.</p>

            <p>We show that quantum information scrambling can enable a generic SWAP gate between collective degrees of freedom in systems without universal local control. Our protocol combines the Hayden-Preskill recovery scheme, associated with the black hole information paradox, with quantum teleportation and runs them in parallel and in opposite directions, enabling bidirectional exchange of quantum states through global interactions alone. This approach cleanly distinguishes the roles of information spreading, entanglement, and chaos for enabling both coherent state transfer and recovery. We propose an experimental realization using the Dicke model, which can be realized in cavity-QED and trapped-ion platforms, highlighting the utility of holography in designing practical quantum gates.</p>

Here, we build an ultrafast diamond nonlinear photonic sensor to assess the surface electric field; an electro-optic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond nanotip breaks the spatial-limit of conventional pump-probe techniques. The 10-fs near-infrared optical pulse modulates the surface electric field of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide and we monitor the dynamics of the local electric field at nanometer-femtosecond spatio-temporal resolutions.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongqi Chen, Chaofeng Xie, Tongtong Zhu, Weiqiang Ding, Yurui Fang</p>
            <p>Transitions from bound states in the continuum (BICs) to quasi-BICs (qBICs) are typically realized by introducing in-plane asymmetry, including permittivity asymmetry ({\epsilon}-qBICs) and geometry asymmetry (g-qBICs). Here, we demonstrate that when the in-plane symmetry is rigorously kept, the transition can also be occurred, provided the out-of-plane asymmetry is designed, which is called {\sigma}h -qBICs in this work. When the {{\sigma}h symmetry is gradually broken, the system undergoes a topological phase transition characterized by a Zak phase inversion, leading to a band inversion between quadrupole and dipole modes. This process not only enables controlled radiation coupling of BICs but also introduces a defect-immune qBIC regime. Our findings establish a general mechanism for engineering high-Q resonances and topologically robust plasmonic cavities.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of antiferromagnetic Dimers in Rydberg Atom Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Yuan Kuang, Lin Li, Weibin Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers within a Rydberg atom chain in the regime where laser detuning compensates for nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. Using an effective PXQ model, we demonstrate that the associated Hilbert space decomposes into disconnected, dimer-conserving subspaces. The classification of these subspaces is provided, and the computational basis states spanning them are identified. Through a combination of analytical mapping and numerical simulations, we compare the dynamics of the PXQ model with those of the full Rydberg atom chain. The deviations are attributed to two factors, laser-induced leakage from the constrained Hilbert subspace and the influence of long-range interactions beyond the NN limit. Our results indicate that subspace leakage can be mitigated by increasing the NN interaction strength. While this simultaneously amplifies the effects of long-range interactions, the conservation of the dimer number remains. Our study opens up possibilities for exploring the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers using the Rydberg atom quantum simulator.</p>

            <h2>Size-dependent Dielectric Permittivity of Perovskite Nanocrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jehyeok Ryu, Victor Krivenkov, Vitaly Goryashko, Yury Rakovich, Alexey Y. Nikitin</p>
            <p>Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising building blocks for quantum photonic devices. Optical properties of PNCs can be enhanced by integration with optical cavities or nanoantennas. Designing such structures requires accurate size dependent dielectric permittivity of PNCs. However, current reports provide primarily ensemble averaged values with limited access to the intrinsic response of individual PNCs. Here we suggest a methodology to reconstruct the size dependent complex dielectric permittivity of CsPbBr3 PNCs from the measured absorbance spectrum of colloidal solution. The permittivity of PNCs is modeled as a sum of Voigt profile oscillators, with the size dependent transition energies governed by the exciton effective mass. Using a transmission electron microscopy derived size distribution of the PNCs, the solution permittivity is obtained via Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. This permittivity is used in a transfer matrix method to simulate and fit the absorbance spectrum, from which the permittivity of PNCs is reconstructed. The extracted spectral linewidth from the imaginary part of the permittivity (78.4 meV) is consistent with single nanocrystal emission linewidths at room temperature. Finite element simulations show enhanced absorption cross section of a single PNC coupled to a nanoantenna, demonstrating applicability of the extracted permittivity. More generally, these findings provide a route to extract intrinsic permittivity of individual nanocrystals from absorbance measurements of their ensembles.</p>

            <p>The maximum work extractable from a quantum system is achieved when the system is driven adiabatically. Frictional work then quantifies the difference in work output between adiabatic and non-adiabatic driving. Here we show that frictional work in a non-integrable spin chain is well-described by the diagonal entropy production associated with the build up of quantum coherence. The relationship is characterized by an effective temperature of the final adiabatic state and holds for slow to moderate driving protocols. For fast protocols, the frictional work is instead described by the quantum relative entropy between the final non-adiabatic and adiabatic states. We compare our results to those obtained from an integrable spin chain, in which case the adiabatic state is no longer described by a single temperature. In this case, the frictional work is described by a sum of terms for each independent subspace of the spin chain, which are at different effective temperatures. We show how integrability breaking can enhance work extraction in the adiabatic limit, but degrade work extraction in sufficiently non-adiabatic regimes.</p>

            <h2>Partitioning networks into clusters of synchronized nodes via the message-passing algorithm: an unbiased scalable approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Massimo Ostilli</p>
            <p>Partitioning large networks into stable clusters of synchronized nodes is a challenging task. Recent approaches based on spectral analysis can provide exact results on specific dynamics but remain unfeasible for very large networks. Moreover, within a stochastic framework, it is unclear which dynamics should be chosen to study synchronization. Here we propose an unbiased and scalable method based on the message-passing algorithm. By exploiting the collective behavior emerging across critical points of an effective Ising-like model, we identify dynamically coherent clusters of synchronized nodes and illustrate the approach on some large real-world networks. We find that, unlike continuous-time dynamics, abrupt desyncrhronization occurs even in simple graphs, without the need to invoke higher order interactions. However, when noise is included, the transition to synchronization becomes smoother and proceeds through the formation of plateaus, albeit at the cost of requiring larger coupling strengths.</p>

            <p>For a few decades, Fluorescent Molecular Rotors have been commonly employed as local probes of microviscosity in complex materials. However, without proper calibration, relating microviscosity to a physical parameter is unclear, which strongly limits their quantitative use in biological media for instance. In this study, the response of a molecular rotor in binary and ternary macromolecular aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights is investigated in order to better rationalize the sensitivity of rotors to their cybotactic environment. More precisely, for the investigated composition range of ternary mixtures, it is shown that a linear mixing rule applies for fluorescence lifetime with the proportion of the two PEG, and with an increasing ratio of heavy PEG leading to larger lifetimes. These results allow to test more precisely the free volume theory, which has been proposed in the context of probing glass transition. Analysis show that while this theory semi-quantitatively captures the observation, its precise use raises some questions.</p>

In this paper, we propose a universal method of digitized counterdiabatic driving, constructing the adiabatic gauge potential in a digital way with the idea of universal counterdiabatic driving. This method has three advantages over existing universal counterdiabatic driving and/or digitized counterdiabatic driving: it does not introduce any many-body and/or nonlocal interactions to an original target Hamiltonian; it can incorporate infinite nested commutators, which constitute the adiabatic gauge potential; and it gives explicit expression of rotation angles for digital implementation. We show the consistency of our method to the exact theory in an analytical way and the effectiveness of our method with the aid of numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are ubiquitous in time-series modelling, with applications ranging from chemical reaction modelling to speech recognition. These HMMs are often large, with high-dimensional memories. A recently-proposed application of quantum technologies is to execute quantum analogues of HMMs. Such quantum HMMs (QHMMs) are strictly more expressive than their classical counterparts, enabling the construction of more parsimonious models of stochastic processes. However, state-of-the-art techniques for QHMM compression, based on tensor networks, are only applicable for a restricted subset of HMMs, where the transitions are deterministic. In this work we introduce a pipeline by which \emph{any} finite, ergodic HMM can be compressed in this manner, providing a route for effective quantum dimension reduction of general HMMs. We demonstrate the method on both a simple toy model, and on a speech-derived HMM trained from data, obtaining favourable memory--accuracy trade-offs compared to classical compression approaches.</p>

            <p>In combinatorial optimization problems with degenerate ground states, fair sampling of degenerate solutions is essential. However, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with a standard transverse-field mixer induces biases among degenerate states as circuit depth increases. Based on quantum-classical correspondence theory, we propose SBO-QAOA, which employs a temperature-dependent Hamiltonian encoding a Gibbs distribution as its ground state. Numerical simulations show that, unlike standard QAOA, SBO-QAOA yields ground-state probabilities converging to finite-temperature values with uniform distribution among degenerate states. These fairness and temperature-targeting properties are preserved even with only four variational parameters under a linear schedule.</p>

            <p>At the heart of quark confinement and hadronization, the physics of flux strings has recently become a focal point in the field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP). Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges. Finally, we provide efficient qudit circuits for a quantum simulation experiment in which our results can be observed in state-of-the-art ion-trap setups. Our findings lay the groundwork for quantum simulations of flux strings towards the quantum field theory limit.</p>

            <p>Understanding how to analyze highly entangled thermal eigenstates is a central challenge in the study of quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we introduce a stabilizer-based approach to construct analytically tractable energy eigenstates of nonintegrable many-body Hamiltonians. Focusing on zero-energy eigenstates at infinite temperature, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy $k$-body microscopic thermal equilibrium for any $k\ge4$. We further show that this bound is tight by explicitly constructing two-body nonintegrable Hamiltonians whose stabilizer eigenstates reproduce thermal expectation values for all two-body and all three-body observables. Finally, we identify the structural origin of this limitation by characterizing the conditions under which a stabilizer state can appear as a zero-energy eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, thereby revealing a fundamental constraint imposed by the few-body nature of interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melody Lee, Roland C. Farrell</p>
            <p>Probing energy-dependent transport in quantum simulators requires preparing states with tunable energy and small energy variance. Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport properties with improved energy resolution. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we prepare and evolve wavepackets on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and identify an energy-dependent localization transition in the Anderson model on an 8x7 lattice--a finite-size mobility edge. We observe that a wavepacket initialized at low energy remains spatially localized under time evolution, while a high-energy wavepacket delocalizes, consistent with the presence of a mobility edge. Crucial to our experiments is an error mitigation strategy that infers the noiseless output bit string distribution using maximum-likelihood estimation. Compared to post-selection, this method removes systematic errors and reduces statistical uncertainty by up to a factor of 5. We extend our methods to the many-particle regime by developing a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional model of interacting fermions. This technique has modest quantum resource requirements, making wavepacket-based studies of transport in many-body systems a promising application for near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Political moderation, a key attractor in democratic systems, proves highly fragile under realistic information conditions. We develop a stochastic model of opinion dynamics to analyze how noise and differential susceptibility reshape the political spectrum. Extending Marvel et al.'s deterministic framework, we incorporate stochastic media influence $\zeta(t)$ and neuropolitically-grounded sensitivity differences ($\sigma_y > \sigma_x$). Analysis reveals the moderate population -- stable in deterministic models -- undergoes catastrophic collapse under stochastic forcing. This occurs through an effective deradicalization asymmetry ($u_{B}^{\text{eff}} = u + \sigma_y^2/2 > u_{A}^{\text{eff}}$) that drives conservatives to extinction, eliminating cross-cutting interactions that sustain moderates. The system exhibits a phase transition from multi-stable coexistence to liberal dominance, demonstrating how information flow architecture -- independent of content -- systematically dismantles the political center. Our findings reveal moderation as an emergent property highly vulnerable to stochastic perturbations in complex social systems.</p>

This lower energy scale is accompanied by a correspondingly smaller gate voltage, which means that the strong-field regime is more easily accessible than in the Bernal case. Finally, we show that the interlayer coherence energy is a directly accessible experimental quantity through the position of a power-law divergence in the optical conductivity.</p>

            <p>We establish a duality between open many-body systems governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation and satisfying the detailed balance condition on the one side, and closed bilayer systems with a self-adjoint Hamiltonian on the other side. Under this duality, the identity operator on the open system side maps to a quantum many-body scar of the dual Hamiltonian $\mathcal H$. This scar eigenstate has a form of a thermofield double state for a single-body conserved quantity entering the detailed balance conditions. A remarkable feature of this thermofield scar is a tunable single-layer entanglement entropy controlled by the reservoir temperature on the open system side. Further, we identify broad classes of many-body open systems with nontrivial explicit eigen operators $Q$ of the Lindbladian superoperator. The expectation values of the corresponding observables exhibit a simple exponential decay, $\langle Q\rangle_t=e^{-\Gamma t} \langle Q \rangle_0$, irrespectively of the initial state. Under the above duality, these eigen operators give rise to additional (towers of) scars. Finally, we point out that more general superoperators (not necessarily of the GKSL form) can be mapped to self-adjoint Hamiltonians of bilayer systems harbouring scars, and provide an example thereof.</p>

While this behavior can be described by a boundary sine gordon (BSG) model derived from electron tunneling, the microscopic motivation for such strong tunneling is unclear. We use an alternative model based on sliding charge density waves and a density inhomogeneity to clarify the BSG description and calculate the conductance over the full range of transmission. Using a perturbative method and a matrix product state calculation, we draw a quantitative connection between the BSG model and the physical quantum Hall system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>The roton-triggered charge-density-wave (CDW)is widely studied in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) and fractional Chern insulator (FCI) systems, and there also exist field theoretical and numerical realizations of continuous transition from FCI to superfluid (SF). However, the theory and numerical explorations of the transition between FCI and supersolid (SS) are still lacking. In this work, we study the topological flat-band lattice models with $\nu$ = 1/2 hard-core bosons, where the previous studies have discovered the existence of FCI states and possible direct FCI-SS transitions. While the FCI is robust, we find the direct FCI-SS transition is absent, and there exist more intriguing scenarios. In the case of checkerboard lattice, we find an intermediate gapless CDW state without SF, sandwiched between FCI and SS. This novel state is triggered by the roton instability in FCI and it further continuously brings about the intertwined finite-momentum SF fluctuation when the CDW order is strong enough, eventually transiting into an unconventional finite-momentum SS state. The intermediate gapless CDW state is a vestige from the SS state, since the increasing quantum fluctuation melts only the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type SF order in SS but its (secondary) product -- the CDW order -- survives. On honeycomb lattice, we find no evidence of SS, but discover an interesting sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions, with both solids incompressible. Moreover, in contrast to previous single-roton condensation, this sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions is triggered by the softening of multi-roton modes in FCI. Considering the intertwined wave vectors of the CDW orders, Solid I is a vestige of Solid II. Our work provides new horizon not only for the quantum phase transitions in FCI but also for the intertwined orders and gapless states in bosonic systems, which will inspire future studies.</p>

            <h2>Electrical Interconnects for Silicon Spin Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher David White, Anthony Sigillito, Michael J. Gullans</p>
            <p>Scalable spin qubit devices will likely require long-range qubit interconnects. We propose to create such an interconnect with a resistive topgate. The topgate is positively biased, to form a channel between the two dots; an end-to-end voltage difference across the nanowire results in an electric field that propels the electron from source dot to target dot. The electron is momentum-incoherent, but not necessarily spin-incoherent; we evaluate threats to spin coherence due to spin-orbit coupling, valley physics, and nuclear spin impurities. We find that spin-orbit coupling is the dominant threat, but momentum-space motional narrowing due to frequent scattering partially protects the electron, resulting in characteristic decoherence lengths ~15 mm for plausible parameters.</p>

            <p>Superconducting circuits are arguably taking a leading role in driving the ongoing quantum technological revolution. A detailed knowledge of the microscopic fluctuating electromagnetic properties plays an important role in advancing the circuitry design, testing, and material integration of cutting-edge superconducting quantum electronics. Here we report scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum sensing of local magnetic noise environment of an on- chip superconducting resonator. We find that quasiparticle-induced fluctuating magnetic fields can drive NV spin relaxation, which shows a peak value around the superconducting transition point of niobium at the thermal equilibrium state. External microwave driving at the resonator mode frequency significantly increases the quasiparticle density, leading to enhancement of magnetic noise. We further perform optically detected magnetic resonance measurements to demonstrate quasiparticle magnetic noise mediated off-resonant dipole coupling between the NV center and niobium resonator. Our work reports experimental observation of the Hebel-Slichter peak signature by an external sensor outside of a superconductor. The presented study also highlights the advantages of quantum sensors in investigating miniaturized superconducting devices, providing insights into their future performance improvements.</p>

            <h2>Cartesian Nodal Lines and Magnetic Kramers Weyl Nodes in Spin-Split Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Di Zhu, Zhigang Wu, Zhongbo Yan</p>
            <p>When band degeneracy occurs in a spin-split band structure, it gives rise to divergent Berry curvature and distinctive topological boundary states, resulting in a variety of fascinating effects. We show that three-dimensional spin-split antiferromagnets, characterized by symmetry-constrained momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization, can host two unique forms of symmetry-protected band degeneracy: Cartesian nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic Kramers Weyl nodes when spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher J. N. Coveney, David P. Tew</p>
            <p>We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the exact equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy can be obtained from the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CC and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</p>

            <p>Braiding and fusion of Majorana zero modes are key elements of any future topological Majorana-based quantum computer. Here, we investigate the fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes in the spinless Kitaev model, as well as in a spinful model describing magnet-superconductor hybrid structures. We consider various scenarios allowing us to reproduce the fusion rules of the Ising anyon model. Particular emphasis is given to the charge of the fermion obtained after fusing two Majorana zero modes: as long as it remains on the superconductor, charge quantization is absent. When moving the fermion to a non-superconducting region, such as a quantum dot, nearly-quantized charge can be measured. Our findings confirm for both platforms that fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes can indeed be used for the readout of Majorana qubits.</p>

            <h2>Effect of interatomic repulsion and quasi-degenerate states on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clara Palacios, Armando A. Aligia</p>
            <p>We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ and particular states disregarded previously on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a ``sweet spot'' hosting ``poor man's Majorana'' states persist in the presence of $V$, provided that system parameters are appropriately tuned. For the full system, we demonstrate that at the sweet spots of both DQDs, all eigenstates are doubly degenerate. This degeneracy arises from the existence of an operator that maps between two decoupled Hilbert subspaces. Away from the sweet spots, the microwave spectrum becomes sensitive to the choice of initial state. In our study, we consider transitions from the ground state (which depending on the flux alternates between the above mentioned subspaces) to all possible excited states. This scenario corresponds to a system initially in thermal equilibrium at low temperature.</p>

            <p>Modern quantum engineering techniques allow for synthesizing quantum systems in exotic lattice geometries, from self-similar fractal networks to negatively curved hyperbolic graphs. We demonstrate that these structures profoundly reshape Bose-Einstein condensation. Fractal lattices dramatically lower the condensation temperature and enhance condensation fluctuations. In a Sierpiński carpet, quasi-degeneracies in the tight-binding spectrum fragment the condensate. Hyperbolic lattices, on the other hand, exhibit condensation features similar to regular three-dimensional lattices, despite their embedding in only two dimensions: The critical temperature increases as the system grows, and the temperature-dependence of the condensate fraction follows the same power-law as for cubic lattices. We explain these similarities through the similarity of the densities of state at low energies. When strong repulsive interactions are included, the gas enters a Mott insulating state. Using a multi-site Gutzwiller approach as well as a simple strong-coupling expansion, for the Sierpiński triangle we find a smooth interpolation between the characteristic insulating lobes of one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. Our findings establish lattice geometry as a powerful tuning knob for quantum phase phenomena and pave the way for experimental exploration in photonic waveguide arrays and Rydberg-atom tweezer arrays.</p>

            <h2>Universal Phase Transitions of Matter in Optically Driven Cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsan Huang, Zhiyuan Sun</p>
            <p>Optical cavities have been widely applied to manipulate the properties of solid state materials inside them. We propose that in systems embedded within optical cavities driven by incident pump light, the pump induces generic phase transitions into new nonequilibrium steady states. This effect arises from the ponderomotive potential, the effective static potential exerted by the pump on the low energy degrees of freedom, which exhibits a universal steplike structure that pushes the matter degrees of freedom in the direction that redshifts the cavity photon modes. For a two dimensional electron liquid in a driven cavity, this steplike potential pushes the electron density to jump to a smaller value so that a hybrid cavity photon mode is redshifted to slightly below the pump frequency. Similarly, for a dirty superconductor in such a driven cavity, this potential acts on the superconducting order parameter and causes a first order phase transition to a new steady state with a smaller gap. By realistic electromagnetic modeling of the cavity that includes all cavity modes, we construct the nonequilibrium phase diagrams for experimentally relevant devices.</p>

            <p>Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and the outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.</p>

            <p>Single-photon emitters are essential components for quantum communication systems, enabling applications such as secure quantum key distribution and the long-term vision of a quantum internet. Among various candidates, self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) remain highly promising due to their ability to emit coherent and indistinguishable photons, as well as their compatibility with photonic integration. In this work, we investigate the impact of post-growth rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the quantum optical properties of single self-assembled QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode structure. The annealing process induces a controlled blueshift of the emission wavelength by promoting Ga in-diffusion and intermixing. Using resonance fluorescence measurements at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K), we investigate the single-photon statistics, the emission linewidths, and coherence time $T_2$ of the emitted photons. Our results show that, despite the high annealing temperature of $760^\circ$C, the process does not degrade the optical quality of the quantum dots strongly. Instead, we observe single-photon emission with near transform-limited linewidths, where the dephasing time $T_2$ is only a factor 1.5 above the Fourier-limit $T_2=2T_1$. These findings demonstrate that rapid thermal annealing (RTA) serves as an effective tuning method that preserves the key single-photon emission properties and may help reduce undesirable effects such as non-radiative Auger recombination in quantum photonic applications.</p>

            <h2>Floquet Non-Bloch Formalism for a Non-Hermitian Ladder: From Theoretical Framework to Topolectrical Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustav Roy, Dipendu Halder, Koustabh Gogoi, B. Tanatar, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological properties of time-periodic NH systems. Employing a high-frequency Magnus expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust (despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to emergent longer-range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state structure. To substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit (TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sha Jin, Xinyang Li, Xue Fan, Matteo Baggioli, Yuliang Jin</p>
            <p>In the supercritical fluid (SCF) region, at temperatures and pressures above the critical point, the thermodynamic singularity separating liquids and gases no longer exists. Recent arguments based on thermodynamics and critical scalings have revived the proposal that the SCF constitutes an intermediate state of matter, separated from the liquid and gas by two supercritical boundaries, the $L^\pm$ lines. However, until now, the nature of the supercritical state and the physical signatures of these boundaries have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the SCF is characterized by distinct structural, transport, and dynamical behavior. Specifically, the spatial arrangement of particles-captured by the radial distribution function-as well as the diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity, and velocity autocorrelation function in the SCF regime are qualitatively different from those in both the liquid and gas states and exhibit clear physical signatures upon crossing the $L^\pm$ lines. Our theoretical predictions are validated by molecular dynamics simulations of argon and are further supported by existing experimental evidence. These results provide a clear physical foundation for a refined phase diagram of matter in the supercritical region, comprising three distinct states-gas, supercritical fluid, and liquid-separated by two crossover boundaries obeying universal scaling laws.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and uncover exotic universal features from a systematic investigation. In particular, we show that for generic bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians, the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding of hard-core bosonic zero modes. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by a nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with and without the aid of a controlled defect, respectively. Analytic and numerical results are given. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to observe these predictions and identify the parameter regimes for the high-fidelity braiding, paving the way for the experimental observation of our results in the near future.</p>

            <p>In doped Hund's metals, such as the iron-based superconductors, effects like charge doping and chemical pressure are often considered the dominant factors. Partial chemical substitution, however, inevitably introduces disorder. Here, we investigate spin excitations in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$)$_2$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA) by high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) for samples with $x = 0, 0.035,$ and $ 0.085$. In CrBFA, Cr acts as a hole dopant, but also introduces localized spins that compete with Fe-derived magnetic excitations. We found that the Fe-derived magnetic excitations are softened and damped, becoming overdamped for $x = 0.085$. At this doping level, complementary angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) show increased electronic localization and a suppression of the nematic $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ band splitting present in the parent compound. We thus propose a localized spin model that explicitly incorporates substitutional disorder and Cr local moments, successfully reproducing our key observations. Our findings reveal a case where disorder dominates over charge doping in the case of a Hund's metal.</p>

            <p>Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 81%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.</p>

            <p>Using time dependent simulations, we analyze the trajectories of electrons released from a quantum dot in a waveguide made of a spin-orbit-coupled material (InSb). An electron released from the quantum dot, when driven by an electric field follows a trajectory that is deflected by spin-orbit interaction and undergoes spin precession that results in a spin-dependent, snake-like trajectory. The trajectory strongly depends on the initial state of the electron, enabling detection of the electron quantum state in the dot when connected to the T-junction. Notably, we show that the snake-like trajectory persists even under a small external magnetic field with low, incomplete initial electron spin polarization. Our findings are supported by semiclassical calculations of the electron trajectory, which show good agreement with full quantum mechanical simulations</p>

The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution.

Here we report simulations of layered interacting elastic lines as a model for the vortex lattice in three-dimensional superconductors, following a cooling protocol that closely mimics the experimental conditions. We show that finite-thickness effects limiting the hyperuniformity range arise both in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium. Our results provide a theoretical framework to draw a realistic road-map on synthesizing hyperuniform materials when cooling structures on finite host media with disorder.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</p>

While previous studies have investigated the electron scattering due to a roughened surface, the effect of thermal induced atomic motion on the roughened surface remains unclear. To address this gap, we investigated electron transport in pristine and roughened Cu thin films by performing \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories over 20~ps at temperatures of 218~K, 300~K, and 540~K on Cu thin film models, and then calculating the electron transport properties of the resulting snapshots at 100-fs intervals for the last 10~ps using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with density functional theory (NEGF-DFT). As expected, higher temperatures induce larger atomic displacement from their equilibrium positions and increase atomic layer separation. We also find that increase in temperature results in increased resistance (lower conductance) for the pristine film, but less so for the roughened thin film where the surface roughness itself is the main source of resistance. This study provides insights into how pristine and roughened Cu thin films behave under thermal conditions, helping researchers design better treatments to mitigate thermal effects in ICs and their metal interconnects.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical mean field approach to associative memory model with non-monotonic transfer functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshiyuki Kabashima, Kazushi Mimura</p>
            <p>The Hopfield associative memory model stores random patterns in synaptic couplings according to Hebb's rule and retrieves them through gradient descent on an energy function. This conventional setting, where neurons are assumed to have monotonic transfer functions, has been central to understanding associative memory. Morita (1993, Neural Netw. 6 115), however, showed that introducing non-monotonic transfer functions can dramatically enhance retrieval performance. While this phenomenon has been qualitatively examined, a full quantitative theory remains elusive due to the difficulty of analysis in the absence of an underlying energy function. In this work, we apply dynamical mean-field theory to the discrete-time synchronous retrieval dynamics of the non-monotonic model, which succeeds in accurately characterizing its macroscopic dynamical properties. We also derive conditions for retrieval states, and clarify their relation to previous studies. Our results provide new insights into the non-equilibrium retrieval dynamics of associative memory models.</p>

            <p>We present a detailed study of magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity, and X-ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements performed on single crystals of non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$, Au deficiency 18$\%$, a strongly correlated antiferromagnet with Néel temperature T$_N$ = 13.2 K. Field-dependent magnetization measurements reveal a large magnetic anisotropy at low temperatures with an easy axis along the crystallographic c-axis, in which direction a spin-flop transition exhibits strong features in magnetization, specific heat, and resistivity at H$_c$ = 75 kOe. The constructed temperature-field phase diagram connects this transition to the suppression of magnetic order, which evolves from a second-order nature into a first-order transition that bifurcates at the spin-flop into three transitions below 1 K. The smoothed nature of the metamagnetic transitions in non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$ is well described by an Ising model with weak quenched disorder, suggesting that the presence of Au vacancies is sufficient to smear the complex metamagnetic behavior and tune the critical behavior of magnetic order.</p>

            <h2>Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Díaz, J. Rodríguez-Fernández, J. Rubio-Zuazo</p>
            <p>Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 10, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.</p>

            <p>The famous two-fluid model of finite-temperature superfluids has been recently extended to describe the mixed classical-superfluid dynamics of the newly discovered supersolid phase of matter. We show that for rigidly rotating supersolids one can derive a more appropriate single-fluid model, in which the seemingly classical and superfluid contributions to the motion emerge from a spatially varying phase of the global wavefunction. That allows to design experimental protocols to excite and detect the peculiar rotation dynamics of annular supersolids, including partially quantized supercurrents, in which each atom brings less than $\hbar$ unit of angular momentum. Our results are valid for a more general class of density-modulated superfluids.</p>

            <p>Driven suspensions, where energy is input at a particle scale, are a framework for understanding general principles of out-of-equilibrium organization. A large number of simple interacting units can give rise to non-trivial structure and hierarchy. Rotationally driven colloidal particles are a particularly nice model system for exploring this pattern formation, as the dominant interaction between the particles is hydrodynamic. Here, we use experiments and large-scale simulations to explore how strong confinement alters dynamics and emergent structure at the particle scale in these driven suspensions. Surprisingly, we find that large-scale (many times the particle size) density fluctuations emerge as a result of confinement, and that these density fluctuations sensitively depend on the degree of confinement. We extract a characteristic length scale for these fluctuations, demonstrating that the simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental pattern. Moreover, we show that these density fluctuations are a result of the large-scale recirculating flow generated by the rotating particles inside a sealed chamber. This surprising result shows that even when system boundaries are far away, they can cause qualitative changes to mesoscale structure and ordering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaaki Nakamura, Masanori Yamanaka</p>
            <p>We derive the condition for the occurrence of the integer quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional lattice systems with interactions, expressed as $\phi\nu-\rho\in\mathbb{Z}$, where $\phi$, $\nu$, and $\rho$ denote the magnetic flux, the Chern number, and the electron density, respectively. By employing spiral boundary conditions, which treat the system as an extended one-dimensional chain, this condition is obtained directly through a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type and Laughlin-type argument. This approach improves upon the preceding work based on conventional periodic boundary conditions, where the condition was derived indirectly with redundant system-size dependence. The key to this approach is that the spatial directions of the external force and the response can be systematically controlled by a factor of the system size.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory for the plasmon spectrum in dirty superconductors across the entire temperature range. Starting with the microscopic Keldysh sigma model description, we link the plasmon dispersion $\omega(q)$ to the optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega,T)$ of a superconductor, which requires analytical continuation to the lower half-plane of complex frequency. This approach reveals a discontinuity at the superconducting transition: a jump in both the real and imaginary parts of $\omega(q)$ at $T_c$. For any temperature below $T_c$, the plasmon dispersion terminates at a critical wave vector $q_c(T)$ where plasmons remains undamped, with weakly $T$-dependent $\omega[q_c(T)] \approx 2\Delta(0)$. Plasmons significantly attenuate only within a narrow 5% temperature window near $T_c$, with the propagating mode recovering at large $q$.</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices with long-range periodicity exhibit Hofstadter energy spectra under accessible magnetic fields, enabling the exploration of emergent quantum phenomena through a hierarchy of fractal states. However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moiré superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moiré-engineered 2D systems.</p>

            <h2>Topological Interface States and Nonlinear Thermoelectric Performance in Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David M T Kuo</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence and topological nature of interface states (IFs) in N-AGNR/$(N-2)$-AGNR/N-AGNR heterostructure (AGNRH) segments lacking translational symmetry, focusing on their relation to the end states (ESs) of the constituent armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) segments. For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,\beta} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $\beta$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\cal T}_{GNR}(\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.</p>

            <p>Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical approaches to predicting magnetic structures predominantly rely on first-principles calculations. A key challenge of these methods is their requirement for initial magnetic configurations as inputs, which theoretically possess infinite possibilities. In this work, we introduce a strategy based on irreducible representation basis vectors that effectively narrows down the vast space of potential magnetic configurations to a finite set, typically comprising around 20 candidates per material. Despite this significant reduction, the compact input sets generated by our method already encompass the experimental magnetic structures for 253 out of 302 benchmark materials (83.8%) from the MAGNDATA database. These materials have propagation vectors q=0 and unit cells containing up to 40 atoms, all within the Landau framework. Subsequent first-principles calculations correctly identify the magnetic structure in 198 of these cases. We further apply our highly efficient method to 8,422 stoichiometric transition-metal compounds with fewer than 30 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,906 magnetic materials. To demonstrate its utility, we use this database for the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, identifying 1,070 and 392 candidate materials, respectively.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2\pi m$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi-sea area, $\Phi = b k_F^2/2$. As $\Phi$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring nearly periodically in $\Phi$ with period two. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little-Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolas H. Claussen, Fridtjof Brauns, Boris I. Shraiman</p>
            <p>A constitutive relation between stress and strain relative to a reference state is the basic assumption of elasticity theory. However, in living matter, stress is governed by (motor molecule) activity rather than a constitutive law. What paradigm takes the place of elasticity in this setting? Here, we derive a continuum theory of active mechanics by taking the continuum limit of the Active Tension Network model of 2d epithelia. Instead of a reference state, we start from a prescribed active force configuration, encoded in a Riemannian "tension metric". Intuitively, one expects cells to adjust their positions to achieve force balance by rearranging local sources of active stress. More precisely, the cell positions define an embedding of the tension metric into 2d physical space, which determines the macroscopic physical stress. For free boundaries, tissue adopts a certain intrinsically defined shape, the force-balanced embedding with minimal internal stress. Boundary forces then deform this embedding. The resulting stress transformation yields an effective stress-strain relation. Key elements of elasticity hence emerge from a "stress-only" starting point, explaining how tissue shape can be adiabatically controlled by active stress during morphogenesis. Plastic behavior arises from topological cell rearrangement, which we represent by a continuous reparameterization of the tension metric, providing a principled continuum theory of emergent elasto-plastic flow. To express this physics, we use the mathematics of isothermal coordinates and quasi-conformal maps. An explicit coarse-graining study, described in a companion paper, substantiates the results of our continuum analysis. The present theory elucidates the unconventional mechanics of living tissues and may apply to 2d active and granular materials more generally.</p>

            <p>In the technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), the accurate detection and identification of different phases existing in a sample is often limited by overlapping Kikuchi diffraction patterns originating from the extended probing volume of the individual EBSD map points measured in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point. The present method does not require a known orientation relationship between the phases of the overlapping patterns or close neighbor experimental patterns like previously published approaches.</p>

            <p>The fabrication of functional micro- and nano-electronic devices requires the deposition of high-quality materials of different electronic material classes, such as conductors, semiconductors and insulators. To establish ultra-high-resolution additive manufacturing as a viable addition to existing fabrication methods requires the combinatorial additive deposition of different electronic material classes. However, current techniques do not provide such a capability. Here, we demonstrate that droplet confined electroplating, an ultra-high-resolution AM technique initially developed for metals as electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), allows not only the direct deposition of many metals, but also of metal-oxides. Particularly, we demonstrate that applying fundamental electrochemical principles in combination with on-the-fly switching of the deposited material allows for the direct co-deposition of metals, metal-hydroxides and -oxides. Our results exemplify the feasibility of leveraging simple water-based electrochemical concepts to produce intricate and multi-material structures at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>Epitaxial strain is a powerful means to engineer emergent phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that KTaO3, a cubic perovskite in bulk form, can be epitaxially strained into a highly tunable ferroelectric. KTaO3 films grown commensurate to SrTiO3 (001) substrates experience an in-plane strain of -2.1 % that transforms the cubic structure into a tetragonal polar phase with transition temperature of 475 K, consistent with our thermodynamic calculations. We show that the Curie temperature and the spontaneous electric polarization can be system- atically controlled with epitaxial strain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns with respect to the neighboring tantalum columns at room temperature. Optical second-harmonic generation results are described by a tetragonal polar point group (4mm), indicating the emergence of a global polar ground state. We observe a ferroelectric hysteresis response, using metal-insulator-metal capacitor test structures.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vipul Upadhyay, Amikam Levy</p>
            <p>A central open question in chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is whether weak electron-phonon coupling in a helical molecular junction can generate a sizable spin polarization in two-terminal transport without invoking additional strong symmetry-breaking ingredients. We address this question by implementing a self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculation for a helical tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions. The electron-phonon self-energies are evaluated self-consistently, and the transport signal is extracted using the standard magnetization-reversal protocol with a spin-polarized analyzer lead. We benchmark a fully self-consistent NEGF within the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) treatment for both global and local electron-phonon couplings against commonly used approximations, including diagonal self-energy schemes. We quantify how the resulting transport regime and spin polarization depend on phonon frequency, coupling strength, bias, temperature, and system size. In contrast to large polarizations and anomalous size trends reported under approximate treatments, the fully self-consistent calculation yields negligible spin polarization, additionally the electron-phonon coupling mainly renormalizes the spectrum, and transport remains quasi-ballistic across the explored parameter range.</p>

We analytically derive the stability diagram of phase-locked configurations and quantify their robustness to noise and small random initial imperfections, finding excellent agreement with experimental observations.

We focus on the efficiency of the heat-to-coherence work conversion and show that the Carnot cycle achieves the classical Carnot efficiency, while the performance of the Otto cycle is upper-bounded by the Carnot efficiency corresponding to the extreme temperatures of the cycle. We identify entropy generation during the isochoric stages as the key source of irreversibility limiting the Otto cycle's efficiency.</p>

For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOAs, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the category of $U$-modules. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</p>

            <h2>Non-stabilizerness in quantum-enhanced metrological protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanausú Hernández-Yanes, Piotr Sierant, Jakub Zakrzewski, Marcin Płodzień</p>
            <p>Non-stabilizerness (colloquially "magic") characterizes genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) operations necessary for preparation of quantum states, and can be measured by stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). For permutationally symmetric states, we show that the SRE depends, for sufficiently large systems, only on a constant number of expectation values of collective spin operators. This compact description is leveraged for analysis of spin-squeezing protocols, which inherently generate non-stabilizerness. Under one-axis twisting (OAT), the generation of optimal squeezing is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence of SRE with system system size. Continued time evolution under OAT produces metrologically useful "kitten" states-superpositions of rotated GHZ states-that feature many-body Bell correlations but exhibit a smaller, system-size-independent SRE that decreases with increasing Bell-correlation strength. Our results reveal connections between non-stabilizerness, multipartite correlations, and quantum metrology, and provide a practical route to quantify non-stabilizerness in experiments for precision sensing.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of quantum processes: An operational framework for free energy and reversible athermality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himanshu Badhani, Dhanuja G.S., Siddhartha Das</p>
            <p>We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation, and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Comparing the latent features of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofiia Chorna, Davide Tisi, Cesare Malosso, Wei Bin How, Michele Ceriotti, Sanggyu Chong</p>
            <p>The past few years have seen the development of ``universal'' machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) capable of approximating the ground-state potential energy surface across a wide range of chemical structures and compositions with reasonable accuracy. While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that uMLIPs encode the chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.</p>

            <h2>Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Tronci</p>
            <p>We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current. This distinction between force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the correlation-induced quantum torques and the current shift in the spin Hall effect. This Hall shift leads to a new definition of the transport spin current thereby addressing an open question in spintronics. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.</p>

            <p>Accurate determination of transition states is central to an understanding of reaction kinetics. Double-endpoint methods where both initial and final states are specified, such as the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB), identify the minimum energy path between the two and thereby the saddle point on the energy surface that is relevant for the given transition, thus providing an estimate of the transition state within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Such calculations can, however, incur high computational costs and may suffer stagnation on exceptionally flat or rough energy surfaces. Conversely, methods that only require specification of an initial set of atomic coordinates, such as the minimum mode following (MMF) method, offer efficiency but can converge on saddle points that are not relevant for transition of interest. Here, we present an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the CI-NEB with the MMF method so as to get faster convergence to the relevant saddle point. The method is benchmarked for the Baker-Chan (BC) saddle point test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential as well as 59 transitions of a heptamer island on Pt(111) from the OptBench benchmark set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance shows a median reduction in energy and force calculations of 46% [95% CrI: -55%, -37%] relative to CI-NEB for the BC set, while a 28% reduction is found for the transitions of the heptamer island. These results establish this hybrid method as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery of atomic rearrangements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatriz Martín-García, Pedro M. R. Paulo, Sílvia M. B. Costa, M. Mercedes Velázquez</p>
            <p>Thin films of colloidal semiconductor CdSe quantum-dots (QDs) and a styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer were prepared by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique and their photoluminescence was characterized by confocal fluorescence lifetime microscopy. In the films, the photoluminescence dynamics are strongly affected by excitation energy migration between close-packed quantum-dots and energy trapping by surface-defective QDs or small clusters of aggregated QDs. Polymer/QD films with more aggregated QD regions exhibit lower PL intensities and faster decays, which we attribute primarily to the increased ability of excitations to find trap sites among more close-packed QD regions. This was confirmed by comparing films from bilayer or co-spreading deposition, and varying the QD-to-polymer composition or the surface pressure at deposition. The more regular films, such as those obtained by bilayer deposition at high-pressure, display more surface emission intensity and decays with less accentuated curvature. Decay analysis was performed with a model that accounts for excitation energy migration and trapping in the films. In the framework of the model, the photoluminescence dynamics are related to film morphology through the density of energy traps. A lower amount of QD clustering in the films reflects on a lower density of energy traps and, thus, on more emissive QD films, as inferred here for bilayer films relatively to co-spreading films.</p>

            <h2>Exciton-Anyon Binding in Fractional Chern Insulators: Spectral Fingerprints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianhong Lu, Luiz H. Santos</p>
            <p>Transition--metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) uniquely combine topological electronic states realized without external magnetic fields with a strong optical response arising from long--lived excitons. Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moiré TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocal supercurrents in Josephson junctions have recently emerged as a sensitive tool for investigating broken symmetries in superconducting quantum materials. Here, we report an even-odd Josephson diode effect (JDE) in Corbino-geometry junctions fabricated on the pristine surface of a bulk-insulating three-dimensional topological insulator (3DTI). We find that the diode polarity, which indicates the preferred direction of supercurrent flow, robustly alternates its sign depending on the parity (even or odd) of the enclosed vortex number. This behavior is absent in two key control devices: a non-topological graphene Corbino Josephson junction and a 3DTI-based linear Josephson junction. These results indicate that the polarity-tunable JDE is intrinsically linked to the unique combination of the proximitized topological superconductivity in the 3DTI surface and the Corbino device's closed-loop geometry. Our theoretical modeling attributes the observed sign change in diode polarity to the alternating sign of periodic boundary conditions in topological superconductors, supporting the interpretation that the vortex-parity-controlled JDE is a direct manifestation of the underlying Andreev bound state topology associated with the presence of non-Abelian anyons in the vortices.</p>

            <p>CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ is a newly identified strongly correlated kagome superconductor, characterized by non-Fermi-liquid behavior at elevated temperatures and intertwined charge- and spin-density-wave order below $T_{DW}\approx 54$K. Under external pressure, this order is suppressed and a superconducting phase emerges. This phase diagram, which closely resembles that of high-$T_c$ superconductors, together with a kagome flat band near the Fermi level and possible altermagnetic order, has motivated extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. To better understand how pressure influences the ordered states, we present a systematic study of the evolution of the electronic properties under applied pressure. Performing DFT+DMFT (density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory) calculations, we uncover a complex interplay between the redistribution of spectral weight in the flat bands and the strength of electronic correlations under pressure. Our results further strengthen the interpretation that pressure effectively weakens electronic correlations through enhanced orbital hybridization. This, in turn, strongly suggests that superconductivity emerges as a direct consequence of the suppression of the system's ordered phase.</p>

            <p>We compare two complementary theoretical approaches to compute and interpret Floquet sidebands in periodically driven quantum materials: a first-order perturbative approach (first-order perturbative Born approximation, PB1) and time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions (tdNEGF). Using graphene as a model Dirac system, we disentangle in pump-probe setups Floquet-dressed initial states, Volkov-dressed final states (also known as laser-assisted photoelectric effect, LAPE), and their interference. We quantify how photoemission matrix elements, polarization, incidence angle, and near-surface screening shape the momentum-resolved sideband intensity observed in tr-ARPES. PB1 yields an analytical expression for the momentum-dependent sideband intensity, and for graphene it captures the correct symmetry trends, such as the magnitude of the intensities when considering the interference between the Floquet and Volkov states and photoemission matrix elements. tdNEGF reproduces the full energy-momentum-resolved spectra, including hybridization gaps and spectral-weight redistribution. We find qualitative agreement between PB1 and tdNEGF once matrix elements are included; quantitative differences arise near hybridization regions and at specific angles where higher-order processes and self-energies are essential. Thus, for systems with simple band structures and away from these regions, the two approaches can be used in a complementary way.</p>

            <p>Atomically sharp 2D in-plane heterostructures with nanoscale interfaces provide a powerful platform for tailoring optical and electrical properties at the nanoscale, enabling novel device engineering and the exploration of new physical phenomena. However, direct experimental correlation between local dielectric response and excitonic properties across such interfaces has remained elusive. Here, we probed the nanoscale complex dielectric function and the corresponding localized photoluminescence (PL) modulations in heterostructure domains of lateral monolayer MoxW1-xS2 - WxMo1-xS2, synthesized using a liquid-phase precursor-assisted approach. Near-field nano imaging across the visible-near-infrared range enables real space mapping of sharp amplitude and phase changes at the heterointerface, resolving the local complex dielectric function with nano-meter scale spatial resolution. Excitation energy-dependent nano spectroscopy reveals a reversal of dielectric contrast between Mo-rich and W-rich domains at their respective excitonic resonances, consistent with Lorentz-oscillator fits. Complementary hyperspectral nano-PL mapping resolves the evolution of excitonic emission across the lateral heterointerface, with neutral-exciton intensities varying continuously from W-rich to Mo-rich regions. Effective-medium theory modeling of the imaginary part of the effective dielectric function of the heterostructure as a function of photon energy and Mo filling fraction reproduces the observed excitonic trends, linking the PL evolution to a composition-dependent dielectric response. Together, these results provide direct nanoscale correlation between dielectric and excitonic boundaries in laterally stitched monolayer heterostructures and establish a multimodal near-field spectroscopy framework for probing excitonic phenomena at the nanoscale.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic field induced phenomena in Kitaev spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Feng, Nandini Trivedi</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host a variety of fractionalized particles. In Kitaev's paradigmatic honeycomb model a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ fractionalizes into $Z_2$ flux due to emergent $Z_2$ gauge field and matter Majorana fermions. Although these excitations have well-defined dynamics in the integrable limit, their direct experimental identification is notoriously challenging: realistic materials inevitably host additional symmetry-allowed interactions that break integrability and hybridize gauge and matter sectors, while magnetic fields, which are often required to suppress competing order and stabilize a putative QSL regime, further entangle the responses of different fractionalized quasiparticles and may even drive the system into field-induced spin-liquid phases that are not adiabatically connected to the integrable limit. A prominent example is the quantum Majorana metal, in which the distinct dynamics of fractionalized Majorana fermions can become directly visible in scattering. This report highlights recent progress on these related questions: in which field-stabilized QSL regimes and nearby emergent phases, and under what conditions, can the response of a specific fractionalized quasiparticle be isolated and positively understood, thereby clarifying the existence and the experimental scope of putative spin liquids? We review the progress on these questions across Abelian, non-Abelian, and an emergent quantum phases under magnetic field that are not perturbatively connected to the integrable limit. We connect these field-induced dynamical phenomena to concrete experimental observables, relevant for neutron scattering, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and pump-probe spectroscopy that are capable of resolving specific types of fractionalized particles, including Majoranas and $Z_2$ fluxes.</p>

            <p>Recent research suggests the possibility of the two-dimensional breathing-Kagome magnet Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ hosting a quantum spin liquid state, warranting further study into its magnetic properties. Using ab initio calculations, we show that monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ has short-range antiferromagnetic correlations among Nb$_3$ trimers with S = 1/2, and becomes magnetically frustrated due to the underlying effective triangular lattice geometry, and is evidenced by a frustration index of f > 1. The high-temperature susceptibility shows a negative Weiss temperature from Monte Carlo calculations. Considering spin-orbit coupling, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy, including anisotropic exchange, single-ion anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using the four-state energy mapping formalism. Although the elements have relatively small atomic numbers, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is comparable in magnitude to the anisotropic exchange. Additionally, we show that biaxial strain tunes the short-range correlations between antiferromagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic. These findings strengthen our understanding of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ and advance its applications in current condensed matter physics and materials science research, including nanoscale mechanical and spintronics applications.</p>

            <p>Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) with $s$-wave superconducting tips has been widely applied to probe exotic superconductors, but its potential for investigating topological superconductors remains unclear. In junctions between an $s$-wave superconductor and a topological superconductor, the dominant tunneling process is Andreev reflection, in which Cooper pairs from the $s$-wave superconductor tunnel as particle--hole excitations into the surface state of the topological superconductor. In this work, we theoretically investigate the fundamental properties of Andreev and shot noise spectroscopy on topological superconductors, focusing on the $dI/dV$ characteristics and current noise. We develop a real-time description of an effective tunneling action incorporating Andreev reflection processes in the Keldysh formalism and derive analytical expressions for the Andreev reflection current and the associated current noise. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations for representative topological superconductors and provide a catalog of $dI/dV$ spectra and the Fano factor. Our results establish guidelines for probing topological superconductivity using STM with $s$-wave superconducting tips, and provide theoretical benchmarks for future STS experiments.</p>

            <p>Epitaxial strain is a powerful means to engineer emergent phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that KTaO3, a cubic perovskite in bulk form, can be epitaxially strained into a highly tunable ferroelectric. KTaO3 films grown commensurate to SrTiO3 (001) substrates experience an in-plane strain of -2.1 % that transforms the cubic structure into a tetragonal polar phase with transition temperature of 475 K, consistent with our thermodynamic calculations. We show that the Curie temperature and the spontaneous electric polarization can be system- atically controlled with epitaxial strain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns with respect to the neighboring tantalum columns at room temperature. Optical second-harmonic generation results are described by a tetragonal polar point group (4mm), indicating the emergence of a global polar ground state.

            <p>The electronic ground states of transition-metal dichalcogenides are strongly shaped by reduced dimensionality, yet the properties of atomically thin layers remain difficult to probe due to their small size and environmental sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that controlled electrochemical intercalation of organic cations provides a robust bulk platform for accessing monolayer-like physics in NbSe$_2$. Intercalation of tetrapropylammonium and tetrabutylammonium expands the interlayer spacing by nearly a factor of two, electronically decoupling the NbSe$_2$ layers while simultaneously introducing well-defined charge doping. Using a combination of Raman spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoemission, we uncover a pronounced enhancement of the charge-density-wave transition temperature to $\sim 130$ K together with a strong suppression of superconductivity, reproducing the phase diagram observed in exfoliated monolayers. The enhanced charge-density-wave order and reduced $T_c$ arise from the combined effects of dimensionality reduction and electron injection, and are accompanied by distinct dip-hump anomalies in the tunneling spectra suggestive of collective mode excitations. Our results establish molecular intercalation as a powerful and scalable route for engineering competing orders in layered quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Semimetals exhibit intriguing characteristics attributed to the coexistence of both electrons and holes. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a strong trigonal warping effect gives rise to a semi-metallic state near the Fermi surface, offering unique opportunities to explore the interplay of semi-metallic properties with strong correlations and topologies. Here, the observation of quarter semimetals in rhombohedral multilayer graphene by introducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is reported. The semi-metallic characteristics of rhombohedral graphene manifest as nearly vanished Hall resistance and parabolic longitudinal resistance. The strong correlations arising from the surface flat band lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking. SOC proximitized by WSe2 further lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, as evidenced by the hysteretic anomalous Hall effect. The coexistence of fully polarized electrons and holes allows for the observation of a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall resistance. Furthermore, the application of moderate magnetic fields induces a phase transition from quarter semimetals to Chern insulators. These findings establish rhombohedral multilayer graphene as an ideal platform for studying strong correlations and topologies in semimetals.</p>

            <p>Spin fluctuations have been generally believed as the pairing glue of high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) studies have revealed a weak flat spin-fluctuation signal around 45 meV in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, suggesting strong interlayer and weak intralayer magnetic couplings ($SJ_{\perp}\approx$ 60 meV, $SJ_{\parallel}\leq$ 3.5 meV) in contrast to cuprate and pnictide superconductors. Here, we report further INS studies on the Pr and Nd doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ powder samples at ambient pressure. Besides the crystalline electric field excitations at low energies, we have found that the 45 meV flat mode splits into two modes in doped compounds, along with another weak mode at about 60 meV, where the spin fluctuations in La$_2$NdNi$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ are stronger than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Based on an effective Heisenberg model by only considering the nearest-neighbor exchange couplings on the stripe-type antiferromagnetic orders, we conclude that the interlayer coupling $SJ_{\perp}$ is enhanced to about 69 meV and 73 meV for Pr and Nd doped samples, respectively. Our results highlight the crucial role of interlayer coupling in the rare-earth doped bilayer nickelates, which towards to promote high $T_c$ via interlayer $s\pm$ pairing.</p>

            <h2>Energy-efficient time series processing in real-time with fluidic iontronic memristor circuits</h2>

            <p>Iontronic neuromorphic computing has emerged as a rapidly expanding paradigm. The arrival of angstrom-confined iontronic devices enables ultra-low power consumption with dynamics and memory timescales that intrinsically align well with signals of natural origin, a challenging combination for conventional (solid-state) neuromorphic materials. However, comparisons to earlier conventional substrates and evaluations of concrete application domains remain a challenge for iontronics. Here we propose a pathway toward iontronic circuits that can address established time series benchmark tasks, enabling performance comparisons and highlighting possible application domains for efficient real-time time series processing. We model a Kirchhoff-governed circuit with iontronic memristors as edges, while the dynamic internal voltages serve as output vector for a linear readout function, during which energy consumption is also logged. All these aspects are integrated into the open-source pyontronics package. Without requiring input encoding or virtual timing mechanisms, our simulations demonstrate prediction performance comparable to various earlier solid-state reservoirs, notably with an exceptionally low energy consumption of over 5 orders of magnitude lower. These results suggest a pathway of iontronic technologies for ultra-low-power real-time neuromorphic computation.</p>

            <h2>A General Theory of Chiral Splitting of Magnons in Two-Dimensional Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Xie, Dinghui Wang, Chao Li, Xiaofan Shen, Junting Zhang</p>
            <p>Magnons in antiferromagnets exhibit two chiral modes, providing an intrinsic degree of freedom for magnon-based computing architectures and spintronic devices. Electrical control of chiral splitting is crucial for applications, but remains challenging. Here, we propose the concept of extrinsic chiral splitting, involving alternating and ferrimagnet-like types, which can be induced and controlled by an electric field. A symmetry framework based on 464 collinear spin layer groups is established to classify chiral splitting characteristics and electric field responses in two-dimensional magnets. We further elucidate how the spin layer group determines the type of alternating chiral splitting and the dominant lowest-order magnetic exchange interaction. We demonstrate electric-field control over the magnitude and sign of the chiral splitting, enabling control of the spin Seebeck and Nernst effects related to thermal spin transport. This work provides a general theory for electric field manipulation of magnon chirality, paving the way for low-power magnonic logic devices.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical relationship between the macro-texture and micro-structure in dairy processing revealed by the multi-scale simulation of coupled map lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erika Nozawa</p>
            <p>The theoretical relationship between the macroscopic textural quality and microscopic structural quality appearing in the phase inversion processes from fresh cream via whipped cream to butter is revealed by the multi-scale simulation of coupled map lattice (CML) based on the mesoscopic elementary processes of the emulsion interfaces. Using the Young-Laplace equation, we derive the microscopic particle quantities of the size and density of air bubbles and butter grains in an emulsion from the macroscopic rheological quantities of the overrun and viscosity of the emulsion. In doing so, we focus on the size determined by the "tug-of-war" between air bubbles and butter grains via their cohesion pressures, and on the density determined by the "costume change" of the emulsion molecular complexes (clad particles, e.g., butter grain-clad air bubbles) to their suitable size. Using the obtained microscopic particle quantities, we now propose a microscopic state diagram, the size-density plane, in addition to the previously proposed macroscopic state diagram, the viscosity-overrun plane. These state diagrams reveal that while the two well-known different phase inversion processes at high and low whipping temperatures appear as the two parallel processes of viscosity dominance and overrun dominance in the viscosity-overrun plane, they appear as the two orthogonal processes of isodensity/size dominance and isosize/density dominance in the size-density plane. This theoretical simulation result is significant for the quality design of butter because it demonstrates that differences in macroscopic textural quality can be easily controlled by differences in microscopic structural quality.</p>

            <h2>Weak Electron-Phonon Coupling Is Insufficient to Generate Significant CISS in Two-Terminal Transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vipul Upadhyay, Amikam Levy</p>
            <p>A central open question in chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is whether weak electron-phonon coupling in a helical molecular junction can generate a sizable spin polarization in two-terminal transport without invoking additional strong symmetry-breaking ingredients. We address this question by implementing a self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculation for a helical tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions. The electron-phonon self-energies are evaluated self-consistently, and the transport signal is extracted using the standard magnetization-reversal protocol with a spin-polarized analyzer lead. We benchmark a fully self-consistent NEGF within the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) treatment for both global and local electron-phonon couplings against commonly used approximations, including diagonal self-energy schemes. We quantify how the resulting transport regime and spin polarization depend on phonon frequency, coupling strength, bias, temperature, and system size. In contrast to large polarizations and anomalous size trends reported under approximate treatments, the fully self-consistent calculation yields negligible spin polarization, additionally the electron-phonon coupling mainly renormalizes the spectrum, and transport remains quasi-ballistic across the explored parameter range.</p>

            <p>We report on the experimental observation of stimulated cooling in the non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of weakly interacting exciton-polaritons from approximately room temperature down to 20K. By resolving the condensate in energy-momentum space and performing interferometric measurements, we distinguish the condensate from thermalized particles yet occupying excited states macroscopically. In contrast to the analytical quantum theories of non-equilibrium BEC [Shishkov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 065301 (2022)], we observe segmentation of the particle density along the excited states into two fractions both following Bose-Einstein distribution, albeit with different effective temperatures and chemical potentials. Our results indicate that the temperature of the weakly interacting Bose gas is universally set by the density-dependent chemical potential, revealing a defining property of non-equilibrium BECs. Finally, we demonstrate that the stimulated nature of the cooling process directly governs the emergence of quantum coherence of the condensate and shapes the dissipative properties of the excited states.</p>

Our result is valid for arbitrary many-body state of the system, with finite temperature states and the ground state being important special cases that we analyse in detail. We demonstrate that the expression obeys fundamental relations such like the f-sum rule and the detailed balance. We also reveal the hidden fermionic structure behind the correlator. In the static limit we show that it can be written in terms of universal functions which, at zero temperature, coincide with the level spacing distribution function of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. Our work provides a full and exact characterisation of a dynamic correlation function in a strongly correlated interacting quantum many-body system.</p>

            <p>Colloidal quantum dots (cQDs) have emerged as a cornerstone of next-generation optoelectronics, offering unparalleled spectral tunability and solution-processability. However, the transition from laboratory-scale devices to sustainable industrial manufacturing is fundamentally hindered by spin-coating workflows, which are intrinsically wasteful and restricted to planar geometries. These limitations are particularly acute for high-performance cQDs containing regulated elements such as lead, cadmium, or mercury, where poor material utilization exacerbates both environmental burden and cost. Here we report a biphasic dip-coating strategy that redefines the material efficiency of nanocrystal film fabrication. By utilizing an immiscible underlayer to displace ~88% of the active reservoir volume, we demonstrate a deposition geometry that decouples material consumption from total precursor volume. Infrared PbS photodetectors fabricated via this approach maintain their performance against spin-coated benchmarks while reducing ink consumption by up to 20-fold. Our technoeconomic analysis reveals that this biphasic architecture achieves cost parity at film thicknesses an order of magnitude lower than conventional monophasic dip-coating. Our results establish a low-waste framework for solution-processed materials, providing a viable pathway for the resource-efficient manufacturing of optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Increasing the stability of a superfluid in a rotating necklace potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulio Nesti, Luca Pezzè</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have probed the stability of ring superfluids in the presence of Josephson barriers or Gaussian impurities. Here we present a theoretical analysis that extends beyond the regimes explored so far. We study the onset of dynamical instabilities induced by a one-dimensional potential rotating at an effective angular velocity $\omega$, addressing both the tunneling and the hydrodynamic regimes. We show that the critical angular velocity $\omega_c$ increases almost linearly with the number of barriers, with a slope set by their height and width. When the system is quenched into the dynamically unstable regime, it emits multiple solitons, which can switch or even reverse the direction of circulation. The stabilization mechanism is robust against imperfections of the potential and does not require a perfectly periodic array of barriers. In particular, we find that adding a disordered speckle potential to an ordered array of barriers can further increase $\omega_c$: disorder can therefore make a ring superfluid more resilient to dynamical instabilities.</p>

            <h2>Vacuum Torque Without Anisotropy: Switchable Casimir Torque Between Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Dai, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>Casimir torque is conventionally associated with explicit breaking of rotational symmetry, arising from material dielectric anisotropy, geometric asymmetry, or externally applied fields that themselves break rotational invariance. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism: an axially symmetric magnetic field can generate a Casimir torque by inducing an axially asymmetric Casimir energy - and can even reverse the torque's sign. Focusing on two-dimensional altermagnets, we show that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane - while preserving in-plane rotational symmetry - activates an orientation-dependent vacuum interaction through the combined crystalline symmetry $\mathrm{C_n T}$ inherent to altermagnetic order. The resulting torque emerges continuously and scales quadratically with the magnetic field strength. We further analyze its temperature and distance dependence, revealing scaling behaviors that are qualitatively different from those found in uniaxial bulk materials. Our results identify time-reversal symmetry breaking as a powerful route for engineering both the sign and strength of Casimir torque and establish altermagnets as an exciting platform for exploring phenomena driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>The missing links: Evaluating contact tracing with incomplete data in large metropolitan areas during an epidemic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min-Kyung Chae, Woo-Sik Son, Sang Hoon Lee</p>
            <p>Contact tracing (CT) plays a pivotal role in controlling early epidemic spread, particularly when a novel infectious disease emerges. However, the quantitative impact of missing information -- such as untraced cases or unnotified contacts -- on the effectiveness of CT remains insufficiently understood. Using a stochastic agent-based model with sociodemographics from metropolitan areas in South Korea, we simulate how different forms of information loss affect epidemic spreading dynamics. We construct information-loss scenarios based on two types: infector-omission (IO) and contact-omission (CO), including selective (SCO) and uniform (UCO) scenarios; IO corresponds to the omission of infected individuals (nodes) from the tracing process, leading to the loss of all movement trajectories and downstream transmission links originating from them, whereas CO corresponds to the omission of specific contact events (edges), in which infected individuals are identified but some of their transmission links fail to be detected or notified. The sensitivity of epidemic dynamics to increasing omission rates differs markedly between the two types: IO scenarios exhibit substantially stronger and more abrupt changes in transmission structure and epidemic outcomes, whereas CO scenarios produce more gradual effects. In both scenarios, the magnitude of these effects varies across cities, with a lower-population city (Busan) showing greater tolerance to information loss than the largest city (Seoul), underscoring the importance of regional tailoring in CT strategies. Both IO and CO scenarios also lead to an increase in the transmission network diameter as information loss grows, indicating that a small network diameter reflects effective contact tracing that limits the depth of transmission chains.</p>

            <p>The transient Pauli blocking effect offers a promising route for achieving ultrafast optical switching in semiconductors, enabling a rapid switching from an initially opaque state to a relatively transparent state upon photoexcitation. Herein, we demonstrate broadband ultrafast optical switching in degenerate InN thin films, spanning the visible to near-infrared spectral range, using pump-probe transient transmittance measurements. To elucidate the underlying physical mechanism, we perform probe-energy-resolved analysis for ultrafast dynamics, and develop a theoretical model based on a quasi-equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution. The model successfully captures the experimental transients and yields an electron-phonon coupling constant of $1.0\times10^{17}\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-3}\,K^{-1}}$, along with an electronic specific heat coefficient ranging from 1.52 to 2.02 $\mathrm{mJ\,mol^{-1}\,K^{-2}}$, which allow direct prediction of the spectral switching window. Notably, we demonstrate that the Pauli blocking effect can be induced solely by a laser-excitation driven rise in electronic temperature, without requiring significant carrier injection into the conduction band in degenerate semiconductors. These findings offer new insights for designing ultrafast optical modulators, shutters, and photonic devices for next-generation communication and computing technologies.</p>

            <h2>On the testing of grain shape corrections to bedload transport equations with grain-resolved numerical simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yulan Chen, Orencio Durán, Thomas Pähtz</p>
            <p>Using grain-resolved LES-DEM simulations, Zhang et al. (J. Geophys. Res. Earth Surf. 130, e2024JF007937, 2025) aimed to validate a grain-shape-corrected bedload transport equation proposed earlier by the same group. It states that grain shape effects are captured through a modified Shields number that depends, among others, on the drag coefficient, $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$, determined from the force balance for a grain settling in a fluid at rest. To independently vary $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$ in their simulations, the authors changed the boundary conditions on the grains' surfaces: By artificially shifting the locations of the no-slip conditions from the actual grain surface to a virtual surface a distance $l$ into the grain interior, they hoped to well approximate Navier-slip conditions with a slip length $l$. Here, we argue that this approximation is appropriate only if the thickness of the boundary layer that forms around the virtual surface is much larger than $l$, which we demonstrate was not the case for the authors' simulations. In particular, using independent DNS-DEM grain settling simulations for the same hydrodynamic conditions, we directly show that this approximation substantially overestimates the value of $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$ of a Navier-slip sphere. This implies that the conditions created with their artificial method do not correspond to physically realistic scenarios and therefore do not support the authors' grain shape correction. To support this conclusion, we demonstrate that their entire numerical data can be alternatively explained by a simple null hypothesis model, without grain shape correction, based on the virtual-grain rather than the actual-grain size.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of a two-qubit open quantum system, in particular the two-qubit spin-boson model in the strong coupling regime, coupled to two thermal bosonic baths under non-Markovian and non-equilibrium conditions. Two complementary approaches, the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) and Reaction Coordinate Mapping (RCM), are employed to examine various coupling regimes between the qubits and their respective baths. The dynamical features of the model and the impact of the tunneling amplitude on quantum coherence of the system are probed using the $l_1$-norm of coherence. The model is further shown to have non-Markovian evolution. The nontrivial task of calculating entropy production in the strong-coupling regime is performed using auxiliary density operators in HEOM. Motivated by the realization of a quantum thermal device in the strong-coupling regime, the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of the system is investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between the heat and spin currents and the tunneling amplitude is probed.</p>

Next, we formulate the problem of estimating entropy as a problem of estimating the average degree of a graph with the binary entropy function as its connection function. We use this formulation to study the effect of boundaries on the entropy, and to estimate the entropy of soft random geometric graphs in complicated geometries where a closed form pair distance density is not available.</p>

            <p>Quadratic Lindbladians encompass a rich class of dissipative electronic and bosonic quantum systems, which have been predicted to host new and exotic physics. In this study, we develop a Lindblad-Keldysh spectroscopic response formalism for open quantum systems that elucidates their steady-state response properties and dissipative phase transitions via finite-frequency linear and non-linear probes. As illustrative examples, we utilize this formalism to calculate the (1) density and dynamic spin susceptibilities of a boundary driven XY model at and near criticality, (2) linear and non-linear optical responses in Bernal bilayer graphene coupled to dissipative leads, and (3) steady state susceptibilities in a bosonic optical lattice. We find that the XY model spin density wavelength diverges with critical exponent 1/2, and there are gapless dispersive modes in the dynamic spin response that originate from the underlying spin density wave order; additionally the dispersing modes of the weak and ultra-strong dissipation limits exhibit a striking correspondence since the boundary dissipators couple only weakly to the bulk in both cases. In the optical response of the Bernal bilayer, we find that the diamagnetic response can decrease with increasing occupation, as opposed to in closed systems where the response increases monotonically with occupation; we study the effect of second harmonic generation and shift current and find that these responses, forbidden in centrosymmetric closed systems, can manifest in these open systems as a result of dissipation. We compare this formalism to its equilibrium counterpart and draw analogies between these non-interacting open systems and strongly interacting closed systems.</p>

            <p>For heterostructures formed by a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) placed in proximity to a superconductor (SC), no external magnetic field is necessary to drive the system into a phase supporting topological superconductivity with Majorana zero energy states, making them very attractive for the realization of non-Abelian states and fault-tolerant qubits. Despite considerable work investigating QSHI edge states, there is still an open question about their resilience to large magnetic fields and the implication of such resilience for the formation of a quasi-1D topological superconducting state. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of helical edge states in a QSHI-SC junction formed by a InAs/GaSb (15nm/5nm) double quantum well and a superconducting tantalum (Ta) constriction. We observe a robust conductance plateau up to 2 T, signaling resilient edge state transport. Such resilience is consistent with the Dirac point for the edge states being buried in the bulk valence band. Using a modified Landauer-Buttiker analysis, we find that the conductance is consistent with 98% Andreev reflection probability owing to the high transparency of the InAs/GaSb-Ta interface. We further theoretically show that a buried Dirac point does not affect the robustness of the quasi-1D topological superconducting phase, and favors the hybridization of Majorana Kramer pairs and fermionic modes in the QSHI resulting in extended MKP states, highlighting the subtle role of buried Dirac points in probing MKPs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Ren Zhou, Zheng-Cheng Gu</p>
            <p>The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface ${F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Arauz-Moreno, Keyvan Piroird, Elise Lorenceau</p>
            <p>Laminated safety glass (LSG) is a composite assembly of glass and polyvinyl butyral (PVB), a viscoelastic polymer. LSG can be found in building facades, important landmarks around the world, and every major form of transportation. Yet, the assembly suffers from unwanted bubbles which are anathema to one of the most important features of glass: optical transparency. In here, we present an in-depth study of the reasons behind these bubbles, either during high-temperature quality control tests or normal glass operating conditions. We provide a physical model for bubble growth that deals with two gases, thermal effects on gas solubility and diffusivity, and a time-temperature dependent rheology. The model can be extended to n-component bubbles or other materials beyond PVB. By combining experiments and theory, we show that two gases are at play: air trapped in interfacial bubbles in the assembly during lamination and water initially dissolved in the polymer bulk. Both gases work in tandem to induce bubble growth in finished assemblies of LSG provided that (i) the original bubble nucleus has a critical size and (ii) the polymer relaxes (softens) sufficiently enough, especially at elevated temperatures. The latter constraints are relaxed in a condition we termed anomalous air oversaturation that may even trigger a catastrophic, yet beautiful ice flower instability.</p>

            <p>The thermal, mechanical, and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors is governed by their low-energy phonons, yet the impact of atomic-scale disorder on these modes remains poorly understood. Here, we report the first measurement of acoustic phonon dispersions in a quasi-freestanding monolayer semiconductor (MoS2), using helium-3 spin-echo spectroscopy. We identify a defect-driven regime change at a critical wavevector, $q_c$, marking the breakdown of continuum elastic behavior. At this length scale, the flexural mode transitions from continuum bending to defect-pinned standing waves, while the hybridized Rayleigh wave becomes vibrationally disordered in its dispersion and linewidth. We observe multiple defect-induced Van Hove singularities deep within the Brillouin zone and strongly suppressed acoustic group velocities, providing direct experimental evidence that four-phonon processes drive thermal transport in mono- and few-layer MoS2.

            <h2>Target search optimization by threshold resetting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arup Biswas, Satya N Majumdar, Arnab Pal</p>
            <p>We introduce a new class of first passage time optimization driven by threshold resetting, inspired by many natural processes where crossing a critical limit triggers failure, degradation or transition. In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic- and diffusive searchers as key examples uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.</p>

            <h2>Majorana vortex phases in time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators and topologically trivial insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun-Jiang Luo, Mingliang Tian</p>
            <p>Majorana vortex phases have been extensively studied in topological materials with conventional superconducting pairing. Inspired by recent experimental progress in realizing time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators (THOTIs) and inducing superconducting proximity effects, we investigate Majorana vortex phases in these systems. We construct THOTIs as two copies of a topological insulator (TI) with time-reversal symmetry-preserving mass terms that anisotropically gap the surface states. We find that these mass terms have a negligible impact on the vortex phase transitions of double TIs when treated as perturbations, and no additional topological phase transitions are induced. Consequently, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) emerge when the chemical potential lies between the critical chemical potentials $\mu_c^{(1)}$ and $\mu_c^{(2)}$ of the two TI vortex phase transitions. We demonstrate this behavior across multiple THOTI models, including rotational symmetry-protected THOTI, inversion symmetry-protected THOTI, rotational and inversion symmetries-protected THOTI bismuth, and extrinsic THOTI. Remarkably, MVEMs persist even when all surfaces are gapped with the same sign, rendering the system topologically trivial in both first- and second-order classifications. Our findings establish that MVEMs can be realized in time-reversal invariant systems with fully gapped surfaces, encompassing both topologically nontrivial and trivial insulators, thus significantly broadening the solid state material platforms for hosting Majorana vortex phases.</p>

            <p>Magnetic solitons have recently attracted significant attention due to their intricate physical properties and potential applications in information processing. The majority of the studies in this field, however, are focused on a particular type of solitons known as skyrmions, characterised by a unit topological charge. Here, we present a shifted magnetic bilayer that can demonstrate magnetic solitons with arbitrary large topological charges. These configurations, which we call linked skyrmions, consist of multiple skyrmions linked together with topological point defects. These topological point defects, termed as anti-aligned points, originate from the mutually orthogonal Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in two different layers. By tuning the interlayer exchange coupling and the external magnetic field, one can also achieve different ground states in this bilayer. Additionally, the system also demonstrates conventional skyrmion-bags and $k\pi$-skyrmions. Finally we propose a suitable material candidate where these magnetic configurations can be realised. Our findings, thus, can provide a way to achieve solitons with large topological charge and realise them in realistic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandra J. Hardy, Samuel Cameron, Steven McDonald, Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Elsen Tjhung</p>
            <p>We derive a self-consistent hydrodynamic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems from the underlying microscopic physics using Rayleigh's variational principle. At the microscopic level, surfactant molecules are modelled as dumbbells that exert forces and torques on the fluid and interface while undergoing Brownian motion. We obtain the overdamped stochastic dynamics of these particles from a Rayleighian dissipation functional, which we then coarse-grain to derive a set of continuum equations governing the surfactant concentration, orientation, and the fluid density and velocity. This approach introduces a polarization field, representing the average orientation of surfactants, and yields a mesoscopic free energy functional from which all governing equations are consistently derived. The resulting model accurately captures key surfactant phenomena, including surface tension reduction and droplet stabilization, as confirmed by both perturbation theory and numerical simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elisa Serrano Richaud, Sylvain Latil, Lorenzo Sponza</p>
            <p>We investigate the electronic and optical properties of lateral heterostructures made of alternated armchair ribbons of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. It is known that the gapwidth of these heterostructures can be classified into three families depending on the width of the graphene part. Here, by employing ab initio methods (standard and time-dependent density functional theory and GW), we demonstrate that such classification still holds for other electronic states close to the gap. We show that they display trends substantially different from those known for the gapwidth and originate family-specific features in the screening properties and optical absorption spectra (peak energy and intensity). In addition, our use of a tight binding model originally introduced for isolated nanoribbons allows us to discuss some crucial heterostructure's properties in view of those of its isolated building blocks, including charge redistribution at the edges, gap hierarchy inversion, and specific optical selection rules. By bridging the electronic structure to optical absorption spectra in a comprehensive set of systems, this study sets the stage for more refined investigations on the absorption properties of graphene/boron nitride lateral heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We report transient highly strained structural states in individual palladium (Pd) nanocrystals, electronically heated using an optical laser, which precede their uniform thermal expansion. Using an X-ray free-electron laser probe, the evolution of individual 111 Bragg peaks is measured as a function of delay time at various laser fluences. Above a laser fluence threshold at a sufficient pump-probe delay, the Bragg peak splits into multiple peaks, indicating heterogeneous strain, before returning to a single peak, corresponding to even heat distribution throughout the lattice expanded crystal. Our findings are supported by a lattice displacement and strain model of a single nanocrystal at different delay times, which agrees with the experimental data. Our observations have implications for understanding femtosecond laser interactions with metals and the potential photo-catalytic performance of Pd.</p>

            <p>The effective diffusion of Brownian particles in periodic potential has been a central topic in nonequilibrium statistical physcis. A classical result is the Lifson formula which provides the effective diffusion constant in periodic potentials. Extending beyong periodicity, our recent work [arXiv:2504.16527] has demonstrated that a modified Lifson expression remains valid for Brownian motion in quasi-periodic potentials. In this work, we extend our previous results by incorporating spatial quasi-periodic noise and examining different stochastic interpretations, $\alpha\in[0,1]$. The proposed framework is simple, computationally efficient, and unifies the treatment of diffusion in both periodic and quasi-periodic systems.</p>

Detailed characterizations and analysis indicate that W3Re2C is a bulk type-II BCS superconductor with full isotropic gap. Moreover, first-principles calculations indicate that the electron-phonon coupling primarily arises from interactions between W/Re 5d electronic states and their low-frequency phonons. Furthermore, the breaking of inversion symmetry in W3Re2C facilitates the emergence of Weyl points in the electronic structure. Therefore, W3Re2C can serve as a promising platform for investigating the influences of chiral structure on both superconductivity and band topology.</p>

            <p>Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.</p>

This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate how the injector region design of interband cascade lasers (ICLs) impacts the threshold carrier and current densities. The model combines a polarization-sensitive 8-band $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ calculation, electrostatics, and a microscopic calculation of Auger recombination rates. The inelastic carrier-carrier scattering is included to lowest order using quasi-equilibrium Green's functions. It captures the combined effects of charge-carrier redistribution, parasitic absorption, and bias voltage on the Auger recombination rate. We show that heavily doping the electron injector suppresses the dominant multi-hole Auger recombination by reducing the hole population of the recombination quantum wells. This agrees with the experimental observation that the heavy doping reduces threshold currents. Unlike the measurements, however, they do not increase at high doping concentrations in our model, which does not include scattering-mediated light absorption and/or carrier escape. Furthermore, by introducing indium to the conventional GaSb hole injector wells, we explain the rule of thumb from experiments that raising the hole injector levels does not outperform the doping strategy. Our model provides physical insights for optimizing ICL carrier injectors.</p>

            <h2>Langevin equation with potential of mean force: The case of anchored bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex V. Plyukhin</p>
            <p>The potential of mean force (PMF) is an effective average potential acting on an open system, renormalized due to the interaction with the surrounding thermal bath. The PMF determines the correction to the equilibrium Gibbs distribution, but it is generally unclear how to implement the concept for time-dependent phenomena described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position is canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism (AM) has brought renewed attention to the Lieb lattice. Here, we broaden the scope of altermagnetic models on the Lieb lattice by using a general scheme based on spin clusters. We design various altermagnetic models with d- and g-wave on the Lieb lattice, and investigate its interplay with spin-orbit coupling. While the altermagnetic unit cell reconstructs the topological edge states in the strip geometry and leads to the emergence of Dirac points, the in-plane magnetic moments of AM can induce gaps at these points. In an open square geometry, corner modes emerge within these gaps, realizing higher-order topological states. We further verify that the induction of higher-order topology is applicable to all altermagnetic configurations constructed here on the Lieb lattice, and is most pronounced for AM by comparing with the other types of magnetism such as ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism. Our results highlight the exotic properties of AM, and suggest its potential applications in engineering topological quantum states.</p>

            <p>Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical approaches to predicting magnetic structures predominantly rely on first-principles calculations. A key challenge of these methods is their requirement for initial magnetic configurations as inputs, which theoretically possess infinite possibilities. In this work, we introduce a strategy based on irreducible representation basis vectors that effectively narrows down the vast space of potential magnetic configurations to a finite set, typically comprising around 20 candidates per material. Despite this significant reduction, the compact input sets generated by our method already encompass the experimental magnetic structures for 253 out of 302 benchmark materials (83.8%) from the MAGNDATA database. These materials have propagation vectors q=0 and unit cells containing up to 40 atoms, all within the Landau framework. Subsequent first-principles calculations correctly identify the magnetic structure in 198 of these cases. We further apply our highly efficient method to 7,520 stoichiometric transition-metal compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,906 magnetic materials. To demonstrate its utility, we use this database for the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, identifying 1,070 and 392 candidate materials, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koretaka Yuge</p>
            <p>When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale links to infinitesimal parameter variations.</p>

            <p>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) field-effect transistors (FETs), with their atomically thin bodies, are promising candidates for future gate-all-around (GAA) nanoribbon architectures. While state-of-the-art Si GAA nanoribbon transistors feature channel widths in the tens of nanometers, most reported TMD-based FETs remain limited to micrometer-scale dimensions, limiting their relevance for ultra-scaled electronics. In this work, we investigate the channel width scaling in nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer MoS2 grown on 2-inch wafers, achieving widths of approximately 30-40 nm. Remarkably, nanoribbon width scaling enhances the on-current by 30-40%, reaching up to 700 uA/um for the smallest-width devices, while also improving the subthreshold slope (SS) to as low as 70 mV/dec. This enhancement is attributed to a stronger electric field at the nanoribbon edges without significant degradation from edge-related scattering. To further demonstrate the scalability of the nanoribbon device, we evaluate the variability of extremely scaled monolayer MoS2 nanoribbon transistor arrays featuring a contact pitch of 60 nm and an effective oxide thickness (EOT) of approximately 0.9 nm. Beyond MoS2, we extend the nanoribbon structure to WS2 n-type and WSe2 p-type FETs, demonstrating a viable path toward complementary monolayer TMD nanoribbon FETs for future ultra-scaled electronics.</p>

            <p>In the technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), the accurate detection and identification of different phases existing in a sample is often limited by overlapping Kikuchi diffraction patterns originating from the extended probing volume of the individual EBSD map points measured in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point. The present method does not require a known orientation relationship between the phases of the overlapping patterns or close neighbor experimental patterns like previously published approaches.</p>

            <p>We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables $(\rho, p, u^\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent formulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\omega = 0$ for the transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by quantum effects to become $\omega \propto \mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental excitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits infinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV quantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite symmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that preserves a deformed version of such symmetry.</p>

We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect. Moreover, we find signatures of the measurement-induced transition observed in the no-click limit in the moments of the work distribution.</p>

It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first to our knowledge.

            <p>Superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities are the leading technology for highly efficient particle acceleration, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through the controlled introduction of interstitial impurities into bulk niobium. Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on 1.3 GHz niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at 16 MV/m. We also observe an additive effect of O and N impurities in reducing R$_\mathrm{T}$. We discuss these results in the context of field dependent nonequilibrium superconductivity, gap enhancement, and hydrogen trapping mechanisms.</p>

As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched Néel state from Rényi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental Rényi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and Rényi relative entropies.</p>

Expanding the resource-dependent framework introduced in Briozzo et al., 2025, arXiv:2512.08762, agents perform a persistent random walk combined with chemotaxis, directing toward nutrient-rich patches, whose resources are generated by logistic regrowth. We identify distinct phases of collective organization, ranging from disordered gas-like states to polar traveling waves and nematic independent clusters, depending on the interplay between chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise. The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and density waves driven purely by the coupling between population dynamics (birth-death processes) and environmental feedback. Our results bridge active matter physics and movement ecology, demonstrating that complex spatiotemporal patterns can arise without direct interaction between agents, but solely from the maximization of resource intake in a reactive environment.</p>

Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</p>

            <h2>Homogeneous Microwave Delivery for Quantum Sensing with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers at High Pressures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothy A. Elmslie, Luca Basso, Adam Dodson, Jacob Henshaw, Andrew M. Mounce</p>
            <p>Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers have been demonstrated as a useful tool in high pressure environments. However, the geometry and small working area of the diamond anvil cells (DACs) used to apply pressure present a challenge to effective delivery of microwave (mw) fields. We designed and characterized a novel slotted design for mw transmission to nitrogen-vacancy centers (NVs) in a diamond anvil cell via zero-field and in-field optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements across pressures between 1 and 48 GPa. The mw fields experienced by NVs across the diamond culet was calculated from Rabi frequency and found to be higher and more uniform than those generated by an equivalent simple mw line, which will improve performance for wide-field, high-pressure measurements to probe spatial variations across samples under pressure.</p>

            <p>Autonomous materials science, where active learning is used to navigate large compositional phase space, has emerged as a powerful vehicle to rapidly explore new materials. A crucial aspect of autonomous materials science is exploring new materials using as little data as possible. Gaussian process-based active learning allows effective charting of multi-dimensional parameter space with a limited number of training data, and thus is a common algorithmic choice for autonomous materials science. An integral part of the autonomous workflow is the application of kernel functions for quantifying similarities among measured data points. A recent theoretical breakthrough has shown that quantum kernel models can achieve similar performance with less training data than classical models. This signals the possible advantage of applying quantum kernel machine learning to autonomous materials discovery. In this work, we compare quantum and classical kernels for their utility in sequential phase space navigation for autonomous materials science. Specifically, we compute a quantum kernel and several classical kernels for x-ray diffraction patterns taken from an Fe-Ga-Pd ternary composition spread library. We conduct our study on both IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer hardware and the corresponding classical noisy simulator. We experimentally verify that a quantum kernel model can outperform some classical kernel models. The results highlight the potential of quantum kernel machine learning methods for accelerating materials discovery and suggest complex x-ray diffraction data is a candidate for robust quantum kernel model advantage.</p>

            <h2>Deriving a comprehensive dataset of optical constants for metal halide perovskites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akash Dasgupta, Shuaifeng Hu, Seongrok Seo, Qimu Yuan, Yorrick Boeije, Michael Johnston, Sam Stranks, Henry Snaith</p>
            <p>Accurate optical constants are essential for modelling light propagation, absorption, and ultimately photovoltaic performance in state of the art perovskite solar cells and is especially important for multiple junction or tandem cells. However, available datasets for metal halide perovskites remain sparse, inconsistent in quality, and often suffer from unphysical sub bandgap extinction caused by surface roughness and limitations of conventional ellipsometry fits. Here, we present a comprehensive library of complex refractive indices (n,k) for a technologically relevant set of FA based lead perovskites, spanning bromide compositions from 0 to 100 percent, and mixed Pb Sn perovskites with Sn fractions from 0 to 60 %. Using state of the art fabrication protocols that yield high quality films, we combine variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements with highly sensitive sub bandgap probes, including photothermal deflection spectroscopy for neat lead based perovskites and Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy for Pb Sn alloys, to reconstruct fully zeroed dielectric functions across and below the band edge. The measured data are then stitched and recalculated via a Kramers Kronig consistent framework, ensuring physically accurate behaviour across the full spectral range. Finally, we introduce a transformation based interpolation scheme that preserves spectral shape and feature alignment, enabling reliable determination of (n,k) for any intermediate composition or band gap. This complete dataset and interpolation protocol provide a standardized foundation for optical modelling of perovskite and tandem solar cells, addressing longstanding data gaps and supporting accurate simulations of next generation photovoltaic architectures.</p>

            <h2>Exciton-polaron Umklapp scattering in Wigner crystals</h2>

            <p>Strong Coulomb interactions in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors give rise to tightly bound excitons, exciton polarons, and correlated electronic phases such as Wigner crystals (WCs), yet their mutual interplay remains poorly understood. Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective. These results establish WC polarons as a new quasiparticle paradigm and introduce polaron-induced Umklapp scattering as a general route to accessing finite-momentum many-body excitations in 2D quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Magnetoexcitons and Massive Dirac Fermions in Monolayers of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides in a High Magnetic Field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katarzyna Sadecka, Marek Korkusinski, Ludmiła Szulakowska, Paweł Hawrylak</p>
            <p>We present a theory of the emission spectrum of magnetoexcitons interacting with a $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall state of massive Dirac fermions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in high magnetic fields. Using an ab initio-parametrized massive Dirac fermion model including valley and spin degrees of freedom, combined with exact diagonalization techniques, we show that interband emission from the massive Dirac Fermion magnetoexciton interacting with $\nu = 1$ state directly probes intra-conduction-band excitations of the $\nu = 1$. Many-body interactions with the filled massive Dirac fermion $\nu = 1$ level yield a strong renormalization of the emission spectrum, including fully polarized emission, a pronounced redshift, and broadening relative to neutral and charged excitons. The calculated spectra are consistent with recent experiments [1-3], establishing magneto-spectroscopy as a probe of finite carrier densities in massive Dirac systems.</p>

            <p>The spin properties of excitons and charge carriers in CsPbBr$_3$ lead halide perovskite crystals are investigated by spin-dependent light scattering in magnetic fields up to 10 T. Spin-flip Raman scattering spectra measured under resonant excitation of exciton-polaritons show a rich variety of features provided by the Zeeman splittings of excitons and of electrons and holes interacting with the excitons. The magnitudes and anisotropies of their Landé $g$-factors are measured. A detailed consideration of the responsible mechanisms is presented and discussed in relation to the experimental data, in particular on the polarization properties of the Raman spectra. We consider several mechanisms for the combined spin-flip Raman scattering processes involving resident carriers and photoexcited excitons and suggest new ones, involving trions in the intermediate scattering state. A double electron spin-flip caused by the exciton interaction with two localized or donor-bound electrons is revealed. The spectral lines of Brillouin light scattering on exciton-polaritons shift in energy and become polarization-sensitive in magnetic field, evidencing the splitting of the exciton-polariton dispersion.</p>

            <h2>Reentrant superconductivity and Stoner boundaries in twisted WSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauro B. Braz, Luis G.G.V. Dias da Silva</p>
            <p>We investigate spin-valley instabilities and their connection to the reentrant superconducting states recently observed in the twisted bilayer dichalcogenide WSe$_2$ at a $5^o$ twist angle. Starting from an effective three-orbital faithful Wannier model for the spin-locked moiré bands, combined with orbital-dependent Hubbard interactions, we analyze the evolution of magnetic instabilities as a function of carrier density using the matrix random phase approximation (mRPA) approach. By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moiré valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moiré orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results. As such, our results suggest spin-valley fluctuations near the van-Hove line as the microscopic origin of the reentrant superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Interlayer Coupling and Excitons in Twin-Stacked Two-Dimensional Magnetic CrSBr Bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijia Ke, Yusuf Shaidu, Jeffrey B. Neaton</p>
            <p>The degree of electronic coupling between individual layers in few-layer van der Waals heterostructures offers a route to engineer their magnetic, electronic, and optical functionalities. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the electronic coupling between two monolayers of CrSBr, an anisotropic two-dimensional magnetic semiconductor, is highly nonlinear and nonmonotonic with respect to their relative twist angle, exhibiting a pronounced maximum at the twin-stacking configuration. The coupling strength scales with both the degree of overlap of Br orbitals adjacent to the van der Waals gap and the cosine of half of the interlayer spin angle. This enhanced interlayer electronic coupling gives rise to excitons delocalized across the two layers with a strong polarization dependence that reflects the details of the interlayer spin alignment. Our results reveal a sensitive interplay between twist angle, magnetism, and excitonic properties in twin-stacked CrSBr bilayers, and they establish twin stacking as an effective route to engineering interlayer coupling and optical response in anisotropic two-dimensional magnets with rectangular lattices.</p>

            <h2>Successful growth of low carrier density $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals using Se-flux in a modified Bridgman furnace</h2>

            <p>Indium selenide (In$_2$Se$_3$) has garnered significant attention for its intriguing properties and applications in batteries, solar cells, photodetectors and ferroelectric devices. However, the controlled synthesis of single phase $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ remains challenging owing to its complex phase diagram, presence of multiple polymorphs and the high volatility of selenium that induces non-stoichiometry and unintentional carrier doping. For ferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3, minimizing the carrier density is essential because leakage current can obscure polarization switching. Here, we report the growth of $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals using a unique approach, the Se-flux assisted modified vertical Bridgman technique combined with liquid encapsulation under high pressure. This approach creates a high-pressure, Se-rich environment that effectively minimizes Se-vaporization. Structural and compositional analysis using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the formation of pure $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with 3R stacking. Furthermore, the crystals exhibit remarkably low carrier density of 1.5-3.2 $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ at 300K$-$the lowest reported to date, reflecting a significant suppression of Se-vacancies relative to the conventional Bridgman or melt-grown crystals. Through transport and ARPES measurements on different batches of crystals, we also demonstrate that the amount of Se-flux plays a crucial role in controlling Se-vacancies. Our results thus establish this modified Bridgman method as an effective strategy for synthesizing large $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with reduced intrinsic defects. This technique can be broadly applied to grow other volatile chalcogenides with reduced defects and controlled stoichiometry.</p>

            <p>We develop a self-consistent first-principles framework for determining the screened Coulomb interaction strength (U) based on constrained dynamical mean-field theory (cDMFT). Unlike conventional approaches, this method incorporates essential vertex corrections within the same embedded-DMFT formalism used for the electronic structure calculation. Using the cDMFT-derived interaction strengths as input to embedded DMFT yields spectral functions in excellent agreement with photoemission experiments across a wide range of materials, spanning 3d to 5d transition-metal compounds, including correlated metals, Mott insulators, altermagnets, and unconventional superconductors. This unified many-body framework establishes a systematic first-principles route for determining interaction strengths in correlated materials and substantially enhances the predictive power of DFT+DMFT and its extensions.</p>

            <p>Quaternary Heusler alloys offer a versatile platform for engineering magnetic and topological transport phenomena through chemical flexibility and tunable disorder. Here, we report a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the magnetic, magnetotransport, and anomalous Hall properties of the quaternary Heusler alloy CoRuFeSi. The compound crystallizes in the LiMgPdSn-type structure with significant Co--Ru antisite disorder and exhibits soft ferromagnetism with a saturation magnetization of $4.21~\mu_{\mathrm{B}}/\mathrm{f.u.}$ at low temperature and a Curie temperature well above room temperature. Hall measurements reveal a robust anomalous Hall effect persisting up to 300~K, with an anomalous Hall conductivity of $\sim 74$~S/cm that is nearly temperature independent. Scaling analysis demonstrates that the anomalous Hall response is dominated by the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism. First-principles calculations identify CoRuFeSi as a topologically nontrivial nodal-line semimetal in its ordered phase. Incorporation of experimentally relevant Co--Ru antisite disorder redistributes the Berry curvature and quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed anomalous Hall conductivity, while preserving half-metallicity. These results establish CoRuFeSi as a disorder-tolerant half-metallic ferromagnet with a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect at room temperature, highlighting its potential for spintronic and Hall-based device applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum droplets in a resonant Bose-Fermi mixture</h2>

            <p>We study the canonical problem of a Fermi gas interacting with a weakly repulsive Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. To explore the quantum phases across the full range of boson-fermion interactions, we construct a versatile variational ansatz that incorporates pair correlations and correctly captures the different polaron limits. Remarkably, we find that self-bound quantum droplets can exist in the strongly interacting regime, preempting the formation of boson-fermion dimers, when the Fermi pressure is balanced by the resonant boson-fermion attraction. This scenario can be achieved in experimentally available Bose-Fermi mixtures for a range of boson-fermion mass ratios in the vicinity of equal masses. We furthermore show that a larger fermion density instead yields phase separation between a Bose-Fermi mixture and excess fermions, as well as behavior reminiscent of a liquid-gas critical point. Our results suggest that first-order quantum phase transitions play a crucial role in the phase diagram of Bose-Fermi mixtures.</p>

            <p>This paper presents an experimental study of microwave single-photon transitions that are magnetic-field-insensitive in degenerate Fermi gases of $^{40}$K. This contrasts with microwave single-photon clock transitions for 0-0 magnetic-field-insensitive states and two-photon clock transitions for non 0-0 magnetic-field-insensitive states in bosonic alkali metal atoms. We show that there are two sets of special transitions between two different hyperfine ground states ($|F$=9/2, $m_{F}$=1/2$\rangle$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $|$7/2, -1/2$\rangle$ and $|$9/2, -1/2$\rangle$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $|$7/2, 1/2$\rangle$), whose microwave single-photon transition frequency is insensitive to low magnetic fields, as the first-order Zeeman shift is almost completely canceled. By using the microwave spectrum and Ramsey interference fringes, we demonstrate the long-time stability of the coherent transition under magnetic field fluctuations. These magnetic-field-insensitive microwave hyperfine transitions in ultracold $^{40}$K Fermi gases offer promising applications in quantum information and precision measurements.</p>

            <p>Traditional statistical mechanics is constrained by the binary paradigms of identical/distinguishable and bosonic/fermionic particle statistics, leading to a fundamental logical gap in describing systems with partial distinguishability. We propose WH Statistics, a unified theoretical framework governed by three key parameters: continuous distinguishability {\lambda}, exclusion weight \k{appa}, and intrinsic exclusivity {\gamma}. By deriving the microstate count and entropy, we show that this framework naturally recovers the Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac, and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, while also incorporating anyons and the classical hard-core (Langmuir) limit. We introduce a class of generalized quasiparticles, termed WHons, which exhibit exotic physical phenomena including non-monotonic degeneracy pressure peaks, Schottky-like specific heat anomalies, and tunable interference effects, driven by the interplay between fractional distinguishability and exclusion. This framework bridges the century-old discontinuity between quantum and classical exclusion principles, providing a powerful tool for investigating strongly correlated systems and programmable quantum matter.</p>

We show how martingale properties emerge directly from the structure of reaction propensities without assuming detailed balance. Stochastic simulations of a simple chemical kinetic proofreading network are used to explore the dependence of the exponentiated entropy production on initial conditions and model parameters, validating our new work theorem relationships.

            <p>Halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for next-generation photovoltaics, laser sources and X-ray detectors. There is intense debate as to whether some photoactive halide perovskites exhibit ferroelectric behaviour and whether it might be possible to utilise the bulk photovoltaic effect to enhance the performance of halide perovskite solar cells. Here, using low-dose scanning transmission electron microscopy, we discover the existence of ferroelastic twin boundaries in vapor-deposited CsPbI3 thin films, parallel to {110} and {112}. Remarkably, despite photoactive CsPbI3 being centrosymmetric and non-polar, we observe directly that Pb atoms shift at {110} twin boundaries driving a local ferroelectric-like polarisation. These polar twin walls form an intrinsic array of nanoscale functional interfaces, spaced ~30-50 nm apart, embedded within the non-polar perovskite lattice. In contrast, {112} twin boundaries remain non-polar but strongly suppress octahedral tilt and off-centre Cs atom displacements, revealing a different untapped ferroic degree of freedom. These discoveries together uncover previously hidden ferroic functionality in halide perovskite semiconductors, opening opportunities for enhanced conductivity and photovoltaic behaviour through domain wall engineering.</p>

The altermagnetic spin-splitting in the single-particle dispersion naturally gives rise to a ground state of two-electron bound pairs with nonzero center-of-mass momentum. This finite-momentum pairing can be interpreted as a two-body mechanism underlying the recently proposed altermagnetism-induced Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state. Additionally, when the nearest-neighbor attraction is strong, the resulting finite-momentum bound pairs exhibit a mixture of both spin-singlet and spin-triplet characteristics, suggesting the possibility of unconventional superconductors, where spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairings coexist.</p>

            <p>Fluctuation-induced forces, such as the Critical Casimir Effect (CCE), are fundamental mechanisms driving organization and self-assembly near second-order phase transitions. The existence of a comparable, universal force for systems undergoing a first-order transition has remained an unresolved fundamental question. The proposed Orderphobic Effect is one such potential mechanism. It arises from minimisation of the interfacial free energy between solutes that locally nucleate a disordered phase. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration and quantitative measurement of the Orderphobic Effect. Using a driven, non-equilibrium quasi-2D granular fluid undergoing a first-order order-disorder transition, we show that specifically designed solutes in an ordered phase nucleate a coexisting ``bubble'' of the disordered phase. By analysing its capillary fluctuations, we confirm that this phenomenon occurs due to the proximity to phase-coexistence, and we directly quantify the attractive force by measuring the interaction free energy between solutes. The observation of this general fluctuation-mediated force in a non-equilibrium steady state strongly supports its claimed universality. Our work establishes the Orderphobic Effect as the first-order equivalent to the CCE, providing a new, general route for controlling self-assembly and aggregation in soft matter and non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p>Water's phase diagram remains one of the most intricate and challenging benchmarks in molecular modeling. In this study, we compute the phase diagram of water using an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential trained on density-functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the revPBE-D3 exchange and correlation functional. We compute solid-liquid chemical potential differences and melting points using biased coexistence simulations with the On-the-Fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) method. Starting from these points, we trace coexistence lines using Gibbs-Duhem integration. This combination of methods allows us to consistently map pressure-temperature phase boundaries and reconstruct the full phase diagram between approximately 100-500 K and 0-4 GPa. The stability regions of the main ice polymorphs (Ih, II, V, VI, and VII) are reproduced in close agreement with experiments. As in earlier studies based on DFT, ice III is metastable and there are systematic shifts of coexistence lines with respect to experimental results. Our results demonstrate the capability of our general-purpose ACE potential to capture the complex phase behavior of water across wide thermodynamic conditions.</p>

Within this framework, we systematically revisit the Cross-Hohenberg classification of instabilities to assess the feasibility and characteristics of the various types of instability arising from the interplay between entropic and energetic contributions. Our analysis demonstrates that only type I and type III instabilities (the Cross-Hohenberg classification) can occur in this system; Energetic contributions do not explicitly generate instabilities, but may implicitly control their occurrence through their influence on the fixed-point (steady-state) concentrations. In cases where instabilities of different types coexist, we show that the resulting patterns are highly sensitive to the relative strengths of the competing instabilities.</p>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are routinely used to model diverse atomistic phenomena, yet parameterizing them to accurately capture solid-state phase transformations remains difficult. We present error metrics and data-generation schemes designed to streamline the parameterization of MLIPs for modeling precipitation in multi-component alloys. We developed an algorithm that enumerates symmetrically distinct transformation pathways connecting chemical decorations on different parent crystal structures. Additionally, we introduce the weighted Kendall-$\tau$ coefficient and its semi-grand canonical generalization as metrics for quantifying MLIP accuracy in predicting low-temperature thermodynamics. We apply these approaches to parameterize an MLIP for a dilute Mg-Nd alloy. The resulting potential reproduces the complex early-stage precipitation behavior observed in experiment. Large-scale atomistic simulations reveal competition between order-disorder and structural transformations. Furthermore, these results suggest a continuous transition between high-symmetry hcp and bcc crystal structures during aging heat treatments.</p>

            <p>The development of visual luminescent thermometers capable of exhibiting pronounced color changes in response to temperature variations requires the rational design of phosphors with high spectrally selective thermal sensitivity. In this work, we present a strategy based on phase-transition-induced activation of cross-relaxation processes in LiYO2:Tb3+. The monoclinic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition modifies the point symmetry of Tb3+ ions in the host lattice, enhances the Stark effect, and enables energetic resonance required for efficient cross relaxation. Consequently, emission originating from the 5D3 excited state is rapidly quenched relative to that from the 5D4 level above approximately 300 K, resulting in a distinct temperature-dependent color change of the emitted light from blue to green. This mechanism yields exceptionally high chromaticity-coordinate-based sensitivities, reaching SRx,max = 0.40% K-1 and SRy,max=0.72% K-1 at 410 K. Furthermore, phase-transition-driven modifications of the Tb3+ emission spectral profile enable the realization of a multimode luminescent thermometer with a maximum relative sensitivity of SRmax=13% K-1. The practical applicability of this system is demonstrated through an ON-OFF luminescent thermal switch and fully filter-free, dynamic two-dimensional thermal imaging using the blue and green channels of a standard digital camera, enabling intuitive visualization, remote readout, and temperature mapping under dynamic conditions.</p>

            <h2>Phase Transitions in Low-Dimensional Layered Double Perovskites: The Role of the Organic Moieties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatriz Martín-García, Davide Spirito, Giulia Biffi, Sergey Artyukhin, Francesco Bonaccorso, Roman Krahne</p>
            <p>Halide double perovskites are an interesting alternative to Pb-containing counterparts as active materials in optoelectronic devices. Low-dimensional double perovskites are fabricated by introducing large organic cations, resulting in organic/inorganic architectures with one or more inorganic octahedral layers separated by organic cations. Here, we synthesize layered double perovskites based on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 that consist of double (2L) or single (1L) inorganic octahedral layers, using ammonium cations of different size and chemical structure. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals phase transition signatures in both inorganic lattice and organic moieties by detecting variations in their vibrational modes. Changes in the conformational arrangement of the organic cations to an ordered state coincide with a phase transition in the 1L systems with the shortest ammonium moieties. Significant changes of photoluminescence intensity observed around the transition temperature suggest that optical properties may be deeply affected by the octahedral tilts emerging at the phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Coexistence of stripe order and superconductivity in NaAlSi</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixia Zhong, Qi Wang, Zhongzheng Yang, Fanbang Zheng, Wenhui Li, Yanpeng Qi, Shichao Yan</p>
            <p>Here, we report a scanning tunneling microscopy study on an s-wave superconductor NaAlSi, revealing the coexistence of stripe order and superconductivity. This stripe order manifests as a unidirectional spatial charge modulation with a commensurate period of four times the lattice constant. This modulation undergoes a phase shift in the differential conductance maps under opposite bias voltages, while its period remains approximately constant over an energy range of $\pm$50 meV. These features suggest that this stripe is likely a static charge order. Furthermore, we find that the stripe order imposes a periodic modulation on the intensity of the superconducting coherence peaks. This work provides new perspectives on the intricate interplay between stripe order and s-wave superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shadan Ghassemi Tabrizi, Thomas M. Henderson, Thomas D. Kühne, Gustavo E. Scuseria</p>
            <p>Mapping spins to fermions via the Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation can render mean-field (Hartree-Fock, HF) descriptions effective for strongly correlated spin systems. As established in recent work, the application of such approaches is not limited by the nonlocal structure of JW strings or by site ordering, because string operators can be absorbed into Thouless rotations of a Slater determinant, and the variational optimization of a unitary Lie-Algebraic similarity transformation removes any ordering dependence. Leveraging these ideas, we develop a self-consistent field (SCF) scheme that expresses the mean-field energy as a functional of the single-particle density matrix, providing an alternative to gradient-based optimization of Thouless parameters. We derive the analytic orbital Hessian to diagnose HF stability and compute ground-state correlation energy through the random-phase approximation (RPA). Benchmark results for the XXZ and J1-J2 model on one- and two-dimensional lattices demonstrate that RPA significantly improves mean-field accuracy.</p>

            <p>Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity, studying the upper critical field and its anisotropy has been crucial for understanding superconducting mechanism and guiding applications. Here we perform in situ high-pressure angular-dependent electrical transport measurements on Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals using a custom diamond anvil cell (DAC) rotator and confirming its anisotropic superconductivity. The anisotropy parameter is approximately 1.6, decreasing with increasing temperature and approaches 1 near Tc. Comparing effective mass anisotropy and inter-block distance in cuprates and iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) reveals that Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals superconductors are consistent with a two-band model, where intralayer quantum confinement within the unit cell induces interlayer coherence, thereby leading to three-dimensional (3D) superconductivity. This study not only establishes the existence of anisotropic superconductivity in bulk Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, but also provide critical insight into the role of dimensionality in high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Uranium tellurides span magnetic and superconducting ground states, yet systematic electronic-structure information across the U-Te series remains scarce. In this study, we perform photoemission measurements on freshly prepared UxTey thin films covering the range of bulk stoichiometries under ultra-high vacuum (10^-9 Pa), enabling clean surfaces and compositions matching bulk phases, including the celebrated UTe2. X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) reveal consistent evolution of the U 4f and Te 3d core levels and valence states across the series, in good agreement with the limited bulk data. Supported by uniform ab initio calculations for all U-Te compounds, we identify systematic trends in U-Te hybridization and charge-transfer effects across the series. These results establish thin-film photoemission as a reliable route for mapping electronic-structure trends in tellurides of heavy elements with diverse electronic ground states.</p>

            <p>Atomic substitution provides a controlled route to engineer lattice dynamics in low-symmetry two-dimensional materials. Here, by combining polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we investigate the evolution of phonon characteristics in CrSBr$_{1-x}$Cl$_{x}$ ($0 \leq x \leq \sim 0.5$) upon partial substitution of Br with Cl atoms. Progressive Cl substitution of Br induces systematic shifts of parent CrSBr out-of-plane $A_\textrm{g}$ phonon modes and activates additional Raman features. These features persist across different polarization configurations and excitation energies, reflecting substitution-induced symmetry lowering and local lattice perturbations. Explicit supercell phonon calculations combined with Raman $\Gamma$-density-of-states simulations identify these features as symmetry-lowered descendants of parent modes arising from alloy disorder. Complementary strain-dependent calculations reveal that anisotropic lattice compression plays a key role in renormalizing Cr-S dominated phonons. Under near-resonant excitation, stimulated Raman scattering-like amplification remains observable with increasing Cl content, highlighting the resilience of anisotropic electron-phonon coupling in this system.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling the Discrepancy Between Theoretical and Experimental Curie Temperatures in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denan Li, Chris Ahart, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>Accurately predicting the Curie temperature ($T_c$) of ferroelectrics from first principles remains a major challenge, as theoretical estimates often fall significantly below experimental values. In this work, we investigate the origin of these discrepancies in the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ by performing extensive constant-pressure ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and benchmarking them against classical molecular dynamics (MD) using machine learning force fields (MLFFs) derived from first-principles data. Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals.</p>

            <p>Indium selenide (In2Se3), a layered chalcogenide with multiple polymorphs, is a promising material for optoelectronic and ferroelectric applications. However, achieving polymorph-pure thin films remains a major challenge due to the complex growth space. In this work, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is successfully leveraged to guide the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of In2Se3 on Al2O3 substrates. By training a predictive Gaussian Process Regressor with sequential learning, we efficiently explored substrate temperature, indium flux, selenium flux, and cracker temperature, reducing experimental trials required for successful synthesis. A {\gamma}-In2Se3 film with 91% phase purity was achieved after fewer than ten trials. Attempts to isolate {\alpha}-In2Se3 were limited by amorphous film formation at low temperatures, indicating that single-step co-deposition is unsuitable for crystalline {\alpha}-In2Se3 on Al2O3. Overall, this study validates Bayesian Optimization as a powerful approach for phase-selective growth in complex materials systems.</p>

            <h2>Abelian and non-Abelian fractionalized states in twisted MoTe$_2$: A generalized Landau-level theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bohao Li, Yunze Ouyang, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>Fractional Chern insulators are lattice analogs of fractional quantum Hall states that realize fractionalized quasiparticles without an external magnetic field. A key strategy to understand and design these phases is to map Chern bands onto Landau levels (LLs). Here, we introduce a universal framework that variationally decomposes Bloch bands into generalized LLs, providing a controlled and quantitative characterization of their effective LL nature. Applying this approach to twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ modeled by first-principles-derived moiré Hamiltonians, we find that the first moiré valence band is dominated by the generalized zeroth LL across a broad range of twist angles, facilitating the formation of Abelian fractional Chern insulators in the Jain sequences. The second moiré band, renormalized via Hartree-Fock calculations at hole filling $\nu_h = 2$, is dominated by the generalized first LL at twist angles $\theta = 2.45^\circ$ and $2.13^\circ$. At $\theta = 2.45^\circ$, we find numerical evidence for a non-Abelian Moore--Read (MR) state at $\nu_h = 5/2$, with consistent signatures in both the energy spectrum and the particle entanglement spectrum. Interpolation studies further demonstrate an adiabatic connection between this state and the MR state in the conventional first LL. In contrast, at $\theta = 2.13^\circ$, a charge-density-wave state prevails in the competition with the MR state due to the larger bandwidth. Our variational mapping provides a theoretical framework for exploring exotic fractionalized phases, including non-Abelian states, in realistic systems.</p>

The devices were fabricated on AlGaO/GaO heterostructures grown by ozone MBE on Fe-doped Ga2O3 (010) substrates. The tri-gate MOSHEMTs, with 1 micron-wide fins and Lg=155 nm, exhibit a peak current-gain cut-off frequency fT=70 GHz and a power-gain cut-off frequency fMAX=55 this http URL fT.L product of 10.85 GHz-micron is the highest among reported Ga2O3 FETs to date. The devices show Vth =-0.5 V, an on/off ratio 10^6 I=80 mA/mm, a peak gm=60 mS/mm, and a low gate leakage current of 10^(-10) mA/mm at Vgs=0.5 V. Passivation with a 100 nm ALD Al2O3 layer effectively removes DC/RF dispersion and maintains stable operation under pulsed IV and repeated RF measurements. These results demonstrate the potential of tri-gate AlGaO/GaO MOSHEMTs for next-generation high-frequency and high-power applications.</p>

            <p>The interplay between the curved spacetimes of general relativity and quantum mechanical systems is an active field of research. However, analysis of relativistic gravitation on extended quantum systems remains understudied. To this end, we study here the effects of a general relativistic curved spacetime on the topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and Kitaev superconducting wire. We find that the topological states remain robust and well localized. In the topological insulator we find that the energy level of the topological state becomes shifted away from zero according to the gravitational redshift, breaking the system's chiral symmetry. In contrast, the Majorana zero mode of the topological superconductor remains at zero energy. Furthermore, within the topological superconductor, we identify the possibility of a gravitationally induced topological phase transition leading to the formation of a domain wall, shifting one of the boundary Majorana zero modes into the bulk.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreyes Nallan, Jian-Gang Zhu</p>
            <p>Probabilistic computers replace logic gates with networks of interacting random variables, creating bidirectional systems that can back-derive inputs from outputs. Such architectures enable efficient generation of random samples, implementations of novel algorithms, and natural solutions to classically hard problems such as prime factorization. We present a new physical implementation for these networks: ferromagnetic disks whose magnetization switching process is triggered by current pulses, skewed by external magnetic fields, and randomized by ambient thermal noise. We show that geometry-dependent magnetostatic interactions between these magnetic cells lead to system behavior that emulates deterministic logic gates. Furthermore, by chaining multiple "gates," we achieve a highly accurate bidirectional one-bit full-adder, a proof of concept for complex multi-gate logic functions with reversible information flow. This analog magnetic probabilistic computer methodology improves on other implementations in speed, tunability, and energy efficiency, thereby enabling a powerful new pathway towards practical solution of classically hard problems.</p>

            <p>The rotating magnetocaloric effect (RMCE) induced by self-demagnetization has been investigated in the giant magnetocaloric effect (GMCE) material Gd$_5$Si$_2$Ge$_2$. This shape-dependent effect had thus far only been reported in pure Gd, marking this as the first analysis of the effect in a sample with a magnetostructural first-order phase transition. By rotating the applied magnetic field vector while keeping its intensity constant, the demagnetizing field within a high-aspect ratio sample changes significantly, resulting in a RMCE. We characterize RMCE by determining the adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta T_{ad}^{rot}$) directly through temperature measurements, and the isothermal entropy change ($\Delta S_M^{rot}$) via magnetometry and magnetostatic simulations. We obtain a remarkable maximum $\Delta T_{ad}^{rot}$ of 1.77 K for a constant external field of 0.8 T, higher than that obtained under 1.0 T. The magnetostatic simulations not only corroborate the highly non-monotonous field-dependence of $|\Delta S_{M}^{rot}|$, which reaches 95\% of its maximum value at 0.8 T, 6.12 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for the experimentally measured shape, but also estimate a 35\% increase in the maximum $|\Delta S_{M}^{rot}|$ up to 8.67 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ in a simulated shape with higher aspect ratio.</p>

            <p>We study the Lanczos coefficients in a quadratic model given by an impurity interacting with a multi-mode field of fermions, also known as single impurity Anderson model. We analytically derive closed expressions for the Lanczos coefficients of Majorana fermion operators of the impurity for different structures of the coupling to the hybridisation band at zero temperature. While the model remains quadratic, we find that the growth of the Lanczos coefficients structurally depends strongly on the chosen coupling. Concretely, we find $(i)$ approximately constant, $(ii)$ exactly constant, $(iii)$ square root-like as well $(iv)$ linear growth in the same model. We further argue that in fact through suitably chosen couplings, essentially arbitrary Lanczos coefficients can be obtained in this model. These altogether evince the inadequacy of the Lanczos coefficients as a reliable criterion for classifying the integrability or chaoticity of the systems. Eventually, in the wide-band limit, we find exponential decay of autocorrelation functions in all the settings $(i)-(iv)$, which demonstrates the different structures of the Lanczos coefficients not being indicative of different physical behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinava Chatterjee, Chao-Xing Liu</p>
            <p>The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons. Surface phonon Hall viscosity provides a mechanism to control phonon chirality and nonreciprocity via surface magnetization configurations in magnetic topological insulator films.</p>

            <p>Correlating structure with electronic functionality is central to the engineering of quantum materials and devices whose properties depend sensitively on disorder. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers high spatial resolution together with access to structural, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom. However, electrical transport measurements on functional quantum devices remain rare, particularly at liquid helium temperature. Here, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements of niobium nitride (NbN) devices inside a TEM using a continuous-flow liquid-helium-cooled sample holder. By optimizing a thermal radiation shield to limit radiation from the nearby pole pieces of the objective lens, we achieve an estimated base sample temperature of 8-9 K, as inferred from the superconducting transition temperatures of our devices. We find that both electron beam imaging and the magnetic field of the objective lens perturb the superconducting state, because the base sample temperature is close to the superconducting transition temperature of NbN. Finally, we perform calculations that underscore the importance of cryo-shielding for minimizing thermal radiation onto the device. This capability enables correlative low-temperature TEM studies, in which structural, spectroscopic, and electrical transport data can be obtained from the same device, thereby providing a platform for probing the microscopic origins of quantum phenomena.</p>

K substitution introduces hole carriers, whereas Mn provides local moments, resulting in bulk ferromagnetism with Curie temperatures up to $\sim 17$ K. Intrinsic magnetic ordering is further supported by an anomalous Hall contribution and a specific-heat anomaly near $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. A key performance feature is a colossal negative magnetoresistance: for heavily Mn-doped compositions ($y \ge 0.3$), $\mathrm{MR}=[\rho(H)-\rho(0)]/\rho(0)$ reaches approximately $-100\%$ at 2 K and nearly saturates at a relatively low magnetic field of $\sim 0.35\,\mathrm{T}$.

Here, we show freestanding LAO/STO micro-membranes naturally hosting negative-U centers, where lateral confinement arises intrinsically, rather than from engineered nanostructures. These centers coexist with gate-tunable superconductivity and can remain stable upon thermal cycling from millikelvin temperatures to room temperature. Transport is in excellent agreement with calculations based on a negative-U Anderson model, and electrostatic simulations indicate characteristic center sizes of 20-80 nm. Our findings suggest that negative-U centers may arise from the intrinsic interfacial inhomogeneity typical of LAO/STO, and should therefore be considered a general feature of the LAO/STO interface. This could have important consequences for the microwave response of interfacial superconducting devices.</p>

The relatively small number of sites in each grid ($\sim 100$) enables us to compute the exact statistical properties of the systems as a function of temperature and chemical potential by Wang-Landau sampling. For each case considered we highlight the existence of distinct low-temperature ``phases'', featuring, among others, regular-polyhedral, cluster-crystal, and worm-like structures. We highlight similarities and differences between these motifs and those observed on the triangular lattice under the same conditions.

            <p>We investigated the electrical conductivity of platinum nanowires with heights ranging from 2 nm to 200 nm, deposited by focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID). Post-deposition processing was employed to enhance the electrical conductivity of the platinum nanowires. Thermal annealing of as-deposited nanowires in air at 225$^{\circ}$C for 4 hours increased electrical conductance by up to five orders of magnitude. After annealing, 22.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$-long nanowires with a height of 36 nm exhibited resistances of approximately 10 k$\Omega$. This nanowire underwent a reduction in height to one-quarter of its original value, a reduction in width to one half, and a reduction in cross-sectional area by approximately one order of magnitude. The platinum-to-carbon weight ratio increased from 35:65 to 85:15. The electrical resistance decreased monotonically as temperature was lowered from room temperature to 100 mK, confirming that annealed FEBID platinum nanowires are promising building blocks for nanoelectronic devices operating at millikelvin temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Strongly Quenched Kramers Doublet Magnetism in SmMgAl11O19</h2>

            <p>We report magnetic susceptibility, isothermal magnetization, and specific-heat measurements on the rare-earth hexaaluminate SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$, where Sm$^{3+}$ realizes a strongly quenched Kramers doublet on a triangular lattice with an exceptionally weak net exchange scale. The Curie--Weiss analysis yields strongly reduced ground-doublet $g$ factors, $g_{ab}\simeq 0.65$ and $g_{c}\simeq 0.70$. This indicates that the low-temperature response is governed primarily by single-ion physics, with crystal-field splitting and $J$-multiplet mixing jointly renormalizing the Sm$^{3+}$ moment, rather than collective exchange. For $H \parallel c$, the specific heat shows no $\lambda$-type anomaly down to 0.35~K but evolves into a well-defined two-level Schottky peak whose gap grows linearly with field, yielding $g_c\simeq0.62$ and recovering nearly all of $R\ln2$ at high fields, thereby confirming an effective $S_{\mathrm{eff}}=\tfrac12$ Kramers doublet description for $T\lesssim10$~K. Together, these results establish SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ as a weak-exchange, nearly single-ion triangular Kramers magnet in which frustration produce an anisotropic low-field correlated regime without inducing long-range order.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Avalanche Stability of Many-Body Localization with Power-Law Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longhui Shen, Bin Guo, Zhaoyu Sun</p>
            <p>We investigate the stability of the many-body localized phase against quantum avalanche instabilities in a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain with long-range power-law interactions ($V\propto r^{-\alpha}$). By combining exact diagonalization of static properties with Lindblad master equation simulations of open-system dynamics, we systematically map the interplay between interaction range and disorder strength. Our finite-size scaling analysis of entanglement entropy identifies a critical interaction exponent $\alpha_c \approx 2$, which separates a fragile regime, characterized by an exponentially diverging critical disorder, from a robust short-range regime. To rigorously test the system's resistance to avalanches, we couple the boundary to an infinite-temperature bath and track the propagation of the thermalization front into the localized bulk. We find that the characteristic thermalization time follows a unified scaling law, $T_{r_{\text{th}}} \sim \exp[\kappa(\alpha) LW]$ (herein, $L$ is the system size, and $W$ is the disorder intensity), which diverges exponentially with the product of system size and disorder strength. This suppression enables the derivation of a quantitative stability criterion, $W_{\text{stab}}(\alpha)$, representing the minimum critical disorder strength required to maintain avalanche stability. Our results confirm that the MBL phase remains asymptotically stable in the thermodynamic limit when disorder exceeds an interaction-dependent threshold, bridging theoretical debates on long-range MBL and providing a roadmap for observing these dynamics in experimental platforms such as Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Honghao Chen, Jiangjie Qiu, Yi Shen Tew, Xiaonan Wang</p>
            <p>Density functional theory (DFT) is widely used to connect atomic structure with catalytic behavior, but computational heterogeneous catalysis studies often require long workflows that are costly, iterative, and sensitive to setup choices. Besides the intrinsic cost and accuracy limits of first-principles calculations, practical workflow issues such as keeping references consistent, preparing many related inputs, recovering from failed runs on computing clusters, and maintaining a complete record of what was done, can slow down projects and make results difficult to reproduce or extend. Here we present CatMaster, a large-language-model (LLM)-driven agent system that turns natural language requests into complete calculation workspaces, including structures, inputs, outputs, logs, and a concise run record. CatMaster maintains a persistent project record of key facts, constraints, and file pointers to support inspection and restartability. It is paired with a multi-fidelity tool library that covers rapid surrogate relaxations and high-fidelity DFT calculations for validation when needed. We demonstrate CatMaster on four demonstrations of increasing complexity: an O2 spin-state check with remote execution, BCC Fe surface energies with a protocol-sensitivity study and CO adsorption site ranking, high-throughput Pt--Ni--Cu alloy screening for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) descriptors with surrogate-to-DFT validation, and a demonstration beyond the predefined tool set, including equation-of-state fitting for BCC Fe and CO-FeN4-graphene single-atom catalyst geometry preparation. By reducing manual scripting and bookkeeping while keeping the full evidence trail, CatMaster aims to help catalysis researchers focus on modeling choices and chemical interpretation rather than workflow management.</p>

            <p>The coupling of spin and electronic degrees of freedom via the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is an essential ingredient for many proposed future technologies. However, probing the strength and nature of SOI is a significant challenge, especially in heterostructures. Here, we consider the nonlinear Shubnikov-de Haas (NSdH) effect, a quantum oscillatory effect that occurs under conditions similar to those of the well-known SdH effect, but is second order in the applied electric field. We demonstrate that, unlike its linear counterpart, the NSdH effect is highly sensitive to the spin textures that arise from SOI. In particular, we show that the phase and beating of NSdH oscillations in nonlinear conductivities can clearly distinguish between different types of SOI. As a demonstration, we show how NSdH can distinguish between the linear and cubic Rashba couplings that are expected in germanium heterostructures. Our results establish the NSdH effect as a powerful and sensitive probe of SOI, offering a new framework for characterizing materials relevant to topology, spintronics, and solid-state quantum information technologies.</p>

            <h2>Additive-Functional Approach to Transport in Periodic and Tilted Periodic Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang Yang, Zhixin Peng</p>
            <p>We present a unified theoretical framework for effective transport in periodic and tilted periodic potentials based on additive functionals of stochastic processes. By systematically combining the Poisson equation, corrector construction, and martingale decomposition, we show that both the long-time drift and diffusion of overdamped Brownian motion can be derived within a single and transparent scheme. In the absence of external tilt, the formalism naturally recovers the classical Lifson-Jackson formula for the effective diffusion coefficient. When a constant bias is applied, breaking detailed balance and inducing a finite stationary current, the same approach yields the Stratonovich expressions for the effective drift and diffusion in tilted periodic potentials. Beyond one dimension, we demonstrate that the same additive-functional structure extends directly to two-dimensional and general N dimensional periodic diffusions, leading to the standard homogenized drift and diffusion tensor expressed in terms of vector-valued correctors. Our derivation highlights the central role of additive functionals in separating bounded microscopic corrections from unbounded macroscopic transport and clarifies the connection between reversible and nonequilibrium steady states. This work provides a conceptually unified and mathematically controlled route to transport coefficients in periodic media, with direct relevance to stochastic transport, soft matter, and nonequilibrium statistical physics.</p>

            <p>We studied transport of indirect excitons (IXs) and IX mediated spin transport in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure in magnetic fields up to 8 T. We observed the long-range IX transport and the long-range IX mediated spin transport in the magnetic fields. The IX transport and spin transport are characterized by the 1/e decay distances reaching $\sim$ 100 micrometers. The decay distance of the spin transport correlates with the decay distance of IX transport. These decay distances first increase and then decrease with increasing IX density for all studied magnetic fields. The long-range IX transport and the long-range spin transport in the magnetic fields are consistent with the similar long-range transport in zero magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Topological states of matter in disordered systems without translation symmetry have attracted great interest in recent years. These states with topological characters are not only robust against certain disorders, but also can be counterintuitively induced by disorders from a topologically trivial phase in the clean limit. In this review, we summarize the current theoretical and experimental progress on disorder-induced topological phases in both condensed-matter and artificial systems. We first introduce the topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) induced by random disorders and their topological characterizations and experimental realizations. We then discuss various extensions of TAIs with unique localization phenomena in quasiperiodic and non-Hermitian systems. We also review the theoretical and experimental studies on the disorder-induced topology in dynamical and many-body systems, including topological Anderson-Thouless pumps, disordered correlated topological insulators and average-symmetry protected topological orders acting as interacting TAI phases. Finally, we conclude the review by highlighting potential directions for future explorations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shashank Kumar Ojha, Jyotirmay Maity, Srimanta Middey</p>
            <p>Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$), famously described by Nobel laureate K. A. Müller as the "drosophila of solid-state physics", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides.</p>

            <p>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) field-effect transistors (FETs), with their atomically thin bodies, are promising candidates for future gate-all-around (GAA) nanoribbon architectures. While state-of-the-art Si GAA nanoribbon transistors feature channel widths in the tens of nanometers, most reported TMD-based FETs remain limited to micrometer-scale dimensions, limiting their relevance for ultra-scaled electronics. In this work, we investigate the channel width scaling in nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer MoS2 grown on 2-inch wafers, achieving widths of approximately 30-40 nm. Remarkably, nanoribbon width scaling enhances the on-current by 30-40%, reaching up to 700 uA/um for the smallest-width devices, while also improving the subthreshold slope (SS) to as low as 70 mV/dec. This enhancement is attributed to a stronger electric field at the nanoribbon edges without significant degradation from edge-related scattering. To further demonstrate the scalability of the nanoribbon device, we evaluate the variability of extremely scaled monolayer MoS2 nanoribbon transistor arrays featuring a contact pitch of 60 nm and an effective oxide thickness (EOT) of approximately 0.9 nm. Beyond MoS2, we extend the nanoribbon structure to WS2 n-type and WSe2 p-type FETs, demonstrating a viable path toward complementary monolayer TMD nanoribbon FETs for future ultra-scaled electronics.</p>

            <p>In modern technology, the optical readout of magnetic information is conventionally achieved by the magneto-optical Kerr effect, i.e., the polarization rotation of reflected light. The Kerr rotation is sensitive to time-reversal symmetry breaking and generally proportional to magnetization, enabling optical readout of the up and down spin states in ferromagnets. By contrast, antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin arrangement have long been considered inactive to such magneto-optical responses, because of Tt-symmetry (time-reversal T followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here, we report the observation of giant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator alpha-Fe2O3. In this compound, the up-down and down-up spin states induce the opposite sign of spontaneous Kerr effect, whose Kerr rotation angle turned out to be exceptionally large (~ 80 mdeg, comparable to typical ferromagnets). Our first-principles calculations successfully reproduce both the absolute magnitude and spectral shape of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity with remarkable accuracy, which unambiguously proves that it originates from a Tt-symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnetic order, rather than magnetization. This compound hosts temperature-dependent transition between easy-plane and easy-axis antiferromagnetic states, and their contrasting behaviors are also investigated in detail. The present results demonstrate that even a simple collinear antiferromagnetic order can induce a giant magneto-optical Kerr effect, and highlight Tt-symmetry-broken antiferromagnets as a promising material platform for highly sensitive optical detection of up-down and down-up spin states.</p>

We consider the conjecture that the optimal layout is a Hamiltonian path, and that it optimizes a simply computable geometric cost function. Finding the minimum of such a function, which is a variant of the minimum linear arrangement problem, provides the DMRG with an efficient layout of the lattice and improves both accuracy and convergence time. We present applications to the antiferromagnetic and spin glass spin-1/2 models on the square and triangular lattices.</p>

            <p>Compositionally complex solid solutions (CCSSs) consist of a randomly mixed single phase with the potential to enhance electrocatalytic activity through their polyelemental surface atom arrangements. However, microstructural complexity originating from multiple principal elements influences local structure, chemistry, and lattice strain, which might also affect electrocatalytic activity. Here, we investigate the effect of Ru content on electrochemistry and defect formation in Au-Pd-Pt-Ru CCSS thin films. Such defects could provide active sites when terminating at the CCSS surface or modify surface composition through preferential segregation. A thin-film material library covering a wide composition range was fabricated by room-temperature combinatorial co-sputtering. High-throughput compositional, structural and functional characterization, including electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical screening, were used to correlate composition and microstructural features with catalytic activity. Three representative compositions selected from the library - Au68Pd13Pt15Ru4, Au27Pd24Pt23Ru26, and Au9Pd21Pt18Ru52 - were examined in detail. The three samples exhibit face-centered cubic structures, with lattice contraction occurring with increasing Ru content. In addition, with increasing Ru content, a transition from a high density of nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults was observed. Moreover, the hydrogen evolution reaction activity improves with higher Ru content. Atom probe tomography reveals local compositional fluctuations, including element-specific enrichment and depletion at grain boundaries. The findings provide a new insight into surface atom arrangement design in the CCSS electrocatalysts with enhanced performance.</p>

            <p>We propose to use the self-assembly ability of a block copolymer combined with compression-expansion cycles to obtain CdSe quantum dots (QDs) structures of different morphology. The methodology proposed consists in transferring onto mica mixed Langmuir monolayers of QDs and the polymer poly (styrene-co-maleic anhydride) partial 2 buthoxy ethyl ester cumene terminated, PS-MA-BEE, previously sheared by 50 compression-expansion cycles. Results indicate that the shear stress takes out nanoparticles at the air-water interface from metastable states and promoted a new equilibrium state of the Langmuir monolayer, then it was transferred onto mica by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) methodology and the morphology of the LB films was analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy measurements. Our results show that when the amplitude strain increases the QDs domain size decreases and the LB film becomes more ordered. The dynamic of the monolayer relaxation after cycling involves at least three timescales which are related to the damping of surface fluctuation, raft rearrangement and component movements inside each raft. Brewster Angle Microscopy allowed visualizing in situ the raft rearrangement at the air-water interface.</p>

This method enables us to explore $1/N$ corrections to the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ in the number of particles, giving us access to the mesoscopic regime. While this regime is yet largely unexplored due to the challenges of studying it with established approaches, it incorporates intriguing features, such as entanglement between light and matter that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. As a representative application, we calculate physical quantities of the low-energy regime for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising chain in the paramagnetic normal phase by accompanying the graph expansion with both exact diagonalization (NLCE) and perturbation theory (\pcst), benchmarking our approach against other techniques. We investigate the ground-state energy density and photon density, showing a smooth transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic regime up to the thermodynamic limit. Around the quantum critical point, we extract the $1/N$ corrections to the ground-state energy density to obtain the critical point and critical exponent using extrapolation techniques.</p>

            <p>Self-interstitials play a central role in governing the mechanical and anti-irradiation properties of refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs), however, the prediction of interstitial formation energies (Ef) is formidable due to the chemically complex environments in RHEAs. Herein, we develop a framework based on the tight-binding model to quantify the effects of complex alloying and lattice distortion on Ef. Our scheme reveals that Ef is jointly determined by the average d-band center of RHEAs and the d-band width of interstitial sites. Notably, the d-band width mainly depends on the interatomic hopping matrix and atomic size-determined coordination number, which together make the metallic bonding around interstitials in RHEAs resemble the distance-dependence law of van der Waals forces. By capturing d-band coupling character, our descriptor describes both interstitial configurations within a universal framework. Our model reveals a new physical picture of interstitial formation, providing a useful tool for the design of high-performance RHEAs.</p>

            <p>Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is the primary tool for exploring nanoscale functionality, yet standard single-frequency operation is fundamentally limited, because the dynamic tip-sample interaction is mathematically underdetermined. While advanced methods such as Dual Amplitude Resonance Tracking (DART) and Band Excitation (BE) address this by tracking resonance, they face critical limitations: DART suffers from feedback instability on complex topographies, while Band Excitation is constrained by severe trade-offs between spectral resolution and acquisition speed. Here, we introduce Dynamic Multiband Microscopy (DMM), a general framework that bridges these gaps by combining multifrequency excitation with continuous frequency sweeping. We implement this within an automated experimental workflow that autonomously identifies and targets measurement points of interest. In combination with quantitative interferometric detection, this approach brings SPM to the fundamental limits of noise and spectral sensitivity. Validated on ferroelectric nanofibers, this platform enables simultaneous, crosstalk-free 3D polarization mapping, establishing a universal framework for autonomous, high-fidelity nanoscale metrology.</p>

            <p>Ongoing advances in scanning probe microscopy techniques are continually expanding the possibilities for nanoscale characterization and correlated studies of functional materials. Here, we demonstrate how a recent extension of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), known as interferometric vector PFM, can be utilized for simultaneously mapping the local crystallographic orientations and the domain structure of distributed grains in uniaxial ferroelectric polycrystals. By shifting the laser beam position on the cantilever, direction-dependent piezoresponse signals are acquired analogous to classical vector PFM, but without the need to rotate the sample. Using polycrystalline ErMnO$_{3}$ as a model system, we demonstrate that the reconstructed piezoresponse vectors correlate one-to-one with the crystallographic orientations of the micrometer-sized grains, carrying grain-orientation and domain-related information. We establish a versatile approach for rapid, multimodal characterization of polycrystalline uniaxial ferroelectrics, enabling automated, high-throughput reconstruction of polarization and grain orientations with nanoscale precision.</p>

            <p>Contact electrification give rise to charge accumulation at the interface when two materials are brought into contact with each other. The charge accumulation at the interface will diffuse to the interior of the conducting material if the dimensions of the contacting conducting material is of the order of an unknown critical length scale. This contact electrification induced interlayer charge transfer will modify the fundamental physical properties of both the contacting materials. This review first discusses the reported experimental evidence of flexoelectricity induced contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer in conducting thin film based heterostructures. The interlayer charge transfer creates a gradient of charge carrier in both the thin films constituting the heterostructure and also modifies the electron-electron interactions. Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture. This review article presents a unified picture of current status and future directions that will provide the scientists a stepping stone for research in the field of flexoelectricity mediated contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer mediated behavior in the micro/nanoscale heterostructures of the conducting materials.</p>

Here, we numerically investigate this unexplored coarsening of clusters in 2D growing interfaces believed to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Using a two-point spatial correlator, we demonstrate statistical time invariance of the evolving configurations and identify scaling forms shared across distinct models. We reveal a pronounced asymmetry in the growth of the largest clusters: one cluster emerges as a giant structure whose characteristic length exceeds the correlation length. Population-dependent scaling forms for the number densities of cluster areas are uncovered. These findings highlight new universal aspects of growing interfaces and suggest avenues for experimental verification.</p>

            <p>Nickelates represent an emerging class of superconductors that demand innovative approaches for structural and electronic phase modulations. Continuous control over superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in nickelates remains particularly challenging, hindering both fundamental understanding and potential applications. Here, we demonstrate SIT in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors utilizing multiple techniques, including an ${operando}$ monitored reduction (OMR) method. OMR enables ultrawide-range continuous modulation of the Ni 3${d}$ orbital electron occupancy from ~3${d}^7$ to ~3${d}^9$. The 3${d}$ occupancy is calibrated through systematic synchrotron X-ray absorption (XAS), combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) annular bright field (ABF) analysis of oxygen atoms. SIT is further modulated via ionic liquid gating and magnetic field. Strikingly different from cuprates, our Nernst effect measurements show that pairing initiates at the onset of the resistive drop. The subsequent emergence of the Meissner effect at zero resistance marks the establishment of global phase coherence. Angle-dependent magnetotransport within the transition temperature regime indicates a mixture of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) superconducting characters, suggesting the observed SIT deviates from the canonical 2D model. Our results provide a unique perspective on the interplay of structural and electronic phase transitions in the infinite-layer nickelates across the oxygen content-magnetic field-temperature parameter space.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear optical response as a probe of emergent Lorentz symmetry violation in noncentrosymmetric materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme J. Inacio, Nathanael N. Batista, Wesley Spalenza, Humberto Belich, Juan José Palacios, Wendel S. Paz</p>
            <p>We propose an electrically controlled protocol to detect weak Lorentz-violating (LV) backgrounds through the second-order shift photocurrent in noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a spinful Rice--Mele model, we show that a stationary LV background induces a momentum-odd correction to the Bloch Hamiltonian, which generates an odd-in-field contribution to the shift current. This leads to a directional asymmetry, whereby the photocurrent distinguishes opposite orientations of an applied static field. The effect originates from an LV-induced deformation of the interband phase and can be isolated experimentally by comparing field-reversed configurations, with vanishing response at transverse orientations, providing an internal consistency check. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear optical responses offer a practical and symmetry-selective route for probing LV effects in solid-state systems.</p>

            <p>We show that the large $n$ limit of the $O(n)$ quantum rotor model defined on a general graph has the same critical behavior as the corresponding quantum spherical model and that the critical exponents depend solely on the spectral dimension $d_s$ of the graph. To this end, we employ a classical to quantum mapping and use known results for the large $n$ limit of the classical $O(n)$ model on graphs. Away from the critical point, we discuss the interplay between the Laplacian and the Adjacency matrix in the whole parameter plane of the quantum Hamiltonian. These results allow us to paint the full picture of the $O(n)$ quantum rotor model on graphs in the large $n$ limit.</p>

            <h2>Efficient charge transfer in solution-processed PbS Quantum Dot-reduced graphene oxide hybrid materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatriz Martín-García, Anatolii Polovitsyn, Mirko Prato, Iwan Moreels</p>
            <p>Quantum dot - graphene hybrid materials have raised significant interest due to the unique synergy of the optical properties of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) and the transport properties of graphene. This stimulated the development of low-cost and up-scalable solution-processed strategies for hybrid materials with potential application in light harvesting and opto-electronic devices. Here we report a versatile covalent-linking based approach for the functionalization of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), to prepare a variety of QD-rGO hybrid dispersions with QDs of different size and composition (PbS, PbS/CdS and CdSe QDs), and shape (CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods). We achieved a well-controlled QD coverage of the rGO sheets by functionalizing the rGO surface with mercapto-silane linkers. A further spectroscopic investigation of near-infrared PbS QD-rGO materials demonstrates efficient electronic coupling between both materials. The QD photoluminescence emission quenching and exciton lifetime shortening up to 95%, together with subtle graphene Raman G-band shifts upon QD linking, supports electron transfer as the dominant relaxation pathway from the QD to the rGO. The use of core/shell PbS/CdS QDs allows tuning of the transfer efficiency from 94% for a 0.2 nm thin CdS shell, down to 30% for a 1.1 nm thick shell.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakub Rosiński, Michał Gawełczyk, Matthias Weiß, Hubert J. Krenner, Paweł Machnikowski</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive study of quantum dot (QD) coupling to various phononic modes in a phononic waveguide, combining multiband kp and configuration-interaction (CI) QD state simulations with finite-element waveguide mode modeling. We consider self-assembled Stranski-Krastanov InGaAs/GaAs as well as local droplet-etched GaAs/AlGaAs structures. Using kp-CI calculations, we quantify the strain and piezoelectric responses of InAs and GaAs QDs. By systematically isolating volumetric/shear deformation-potential and piezoelectric channels, we demonstrate how mode symmetries dictate distinct coupling mechanisms. We identify the dominant coupling channels and characterize their observable signatures in the QD response. We predict strong linear energy shifts under volumetric strain and quadratic behavior under shear strain, especially in GaAs QDs. The piezoelectric effect is dominated by polarizability, which also leads to a quadratic response. The simulations show energy modulations up to 0.7 meV for an acoustic wave with 0.1 nm amplitude. The quadratic response to shear strain and piezoelectric field leads to frequency doubling in the QD response to a mechanical wave and to non-harmonic time traces when linear and quadratic effects contribute to a similar degree. The deep understanding of QD-acoustic couplings opens pathways to the optimal design of QD and waveguide structures, as well as to improved engineering of acousto-optic quantum interfaces.</p>

            <p>In this work we explore the possibility of using sparse statistical modeling in condensed matter physics. The procedure is employed to two well known problems: elemental superconductors and heavy fermions, and was shown that in most cases performs better than other AI methods, such as machine or deep learning. More importantly, sparse modeling has two major advantages over other methods: the ability to deal with small data sets and in particular its interpretabilty. Namely, sparse modeling can provide insight into the calculation process and allow the users to give physical interpretation of their results. We argue that many other problems in condensed matter physics would benefit from these properties of sparse statistical modeling.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous (3+1)d Fermionic Topological Quantum Field Theories via Symmetry Extension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheyan Wan, Juven Wang</p>
            <p>Discrete finite-group global symmetries may suffer from nonperturbative 't-Hooft anomalies. Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}}\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\rm F}$ or Spin$\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \to K \to G_{\rm Tot} \to G \to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\bf B \pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms. We identify the corresponding minimal $K$-gauge fermionic TQFT that cancels these anomalies and can be interpreted as a gapped, topologically ordered dark sector replacing missing Weyl fermions via symmetry extension, without invoking conventional Anderson-Higgs symmetry breaking.</p>

            <p>Surface wettability, governed by both topography and chemistry, plays a critical role in applications such as heat transfer, lubrication, microfluidics, and surface coatings. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly. This work demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to model and predict wetting behavior by capturing the complex interplay of surface characteristics, offering a data-driven pathway for designing tailored functional surfaces.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Shiraishi--Mori construction is exhaustive for ferromagnetic quantum many-body scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Omiya</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) constitute a subtle violation of ergodicity through a set of non-thermal eigenstates, referred to as scar states, which are embedded in an otherwise thermal spectrum. In a broad class of known examples, these scar states admit a simple interpretation: they are magnon excitations of fixed momentum on top of a ferromagnetic background. In this paper we prove that any Hamiltonian hosting such ``ferromagnetic scar states'' necessarily admits a structural decomposition into a Zeeman term and an ``annihilator'' that annihilates the entire scar manifold. Moreover, we show that this annihilator must itself decompose into a sum of terms built from local projectors that locally annihilate the scar states. This architecture is closely related to the Shiraishi--Mori construction, and our main theorem establishes that an appropriate generalization of that construction is in fact essentially exhaustive for this class of scar states.</p>

            <h2>Efficient O(N^1.5) Electronic Structure Computation of Million-Atom Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zichong Zhang, Shuze Zhu</p>
            <p>The exploration of quantum phenomena in complex materials such as moiré superlattices is limited by the O(N^3) scaling of conventional electronic structure methods. Here we introduce a high-performance tight-binding framework that reduces the complexity to O(N^1.5) by transforming the Hamiltonian into a real symmetric form and combining Sylvester's inertia law with LDL decomposition. This approach enables efficient band structure calculations for large systems: solving magic angle twisted bilayer graphene in minutes on a laptop and scaling to 1.5 million atoms within days on a workstation. We apply it to the previously inaccessible ultra-low twist-angle regime (less than 0.16 degree) with mechanical strain relaxation and find robust flat bands persisting down to 0.09 degree. Our framework bridges density functional theory accuracy with large-scale quantum simulation, opening a route to systematic data-driven exploration of mesoscale quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Operator delocalization in disordered spin chains via exact MPO marginals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonnathan Pineda, Mario Collura, Gianluca Passarelli, Procolo Lucignaon, Davide Rossini, Angelo Russomanno</p>
            <p>We investigate operator delocalization in disordered one-dimensional spin chains by introducing -- besides the already known operator mass -- a complementary measure of operator complexity: the operator length. Like the operator nonstabilizerness, both these quantities are defined from the expansion of time-evolved operators in the Pauli basis. They characterize, respectively, the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially and the spatial extent of its support. We show that both the operator mass and length can be computed efficiently and exactly within a matrix-product-operator (MPS) framework, providing direct access to their full probability distributions, without resorting to stochastic sampling. Applying this approach to the disordered XXZ spin-1/2 chain, we find sharply distinct behaviors in non-interacting and interacting regimes. In the Anderson-localized case, operator mass, length, and operator entanglement entropy rapidly saturate, signaling the absence of scrambling. By contrast, in the many-body localized (MBL) regime, for arbitrarily weak interactions, all quantities exhibit a robust logarithmic growth in time, consistent with the known logarithmic light cone of quantum-correlation propagation in MBL. We demonstrate that this behavior is quantitatively captured by an effective $\ell$-bit model and persists across system sizes accessible via tensor-network simulations.</p>

            <p>Standard quantum metrology relies on ensemble-averaged quantities, such as the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), which often mask the fluctuations inherent to single-shot realizations. In this work, we bridge the gap between quantum information geometry and stochastic thermodynamics by introducing the Conditional Quantum Fisher Information (CQFI). Defined via the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative, the CQFI generalizes the classical stochastic Fisher information to the quantum domain. We demonstrate that the CQFI admits a decomposition into incoherent (population) and coherent (basis rotation) contributions, augmented by a transient interference cross-term absent at the ensemble level. Crucially, we show that this cross-term can be negative, signaling destructive interference between classical and quantum information channels along individual trajectories. Leveraging this framework, we construct a stochastic information geometry that defines thermodynamic length and action for single quantum trajectories. Finally, we derive fundamental quantum speed limits valid at the single-trajectory level and validate our results using the quantum jump unraveling of a driven thermal qubit.</p>

            <p>Accurate determination of transition states remains central to understanding reaction kinetics. Double-ended methods like the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) ensure relevant transition states and paths, but incur high computational costs and suffer stagnation on flat or rough potential energy surfaces. Conversely, single-ended eigenmode-following techniques offer efficiency but cannot often be constrained between specific states. Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms. These results establish RONEB as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery.</p>

            <p>Liquid crystal whispering gallery mode microlasers show high sensitivity to external stimuli and distinct spectral features, rendering them ideally suited for various sensing applications. They also offer intrinsic anisotropic optical properties, which can be used to shape and manipulate light even inside spatially highly symmetric structures. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed optical characterization of a spherical bipolar liquid crystal polymer microlaser that tightly confines the optical path of whispering gallery modes to the equatorial plane. By controlled anchoring of the liquid crystal mesogens followed by polymerization, a fixed refractive index gradient is formed within the spherical microcavity. Consequently, only transverse electric (TE) modes oscillating in the equatorial plane experience the high extraordinary refractive index, allowing to confine lasing into a single plane. Furthermore, we observe that the refractive index gradient causes a characteristic splitting of the TE modes. By combining hyperspectral imaging and analytical modeling, we demonstrate that the observed splitting is caused by lifting of the energy degeneracy of higher order azimuthal laser modes, enabling direct insights into the complex interplay of refractive index gradients and resulting whispering gallery mode confinement. In addition, the unique ability to confine lasing of a spherical microbead into only a single plane makes these microlasers independent of the exact position of the pump beam, which allows consistent localized sensing especially in combination with fast point scanning microscopes or inside highly dynamic biological environments.</p>

            <h2>Connecting Magic Dynamics in Thermofield Double States to Spectral Form Factors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Sun, Pengfei Zhang</p>
            <p>Under unitary evolution, chaotic quantum systems initialized in simple states rapidly develop high complexity, precluding any efficient classical description. Quantum chaos is traditionally characterized by spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, most notably through the spectral form factor, while the hardness of classical simulation within the stabilizer formalism, commonly referred to as quantum magic, can be quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy. In this Letter, we propose a relation between the dynamics of the stabilizer Rényi entropy for thermofield double states and the spectral form factor, based on general arguments for chaotic systems with all-to-all interactions. This relation implies that the saturation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy is governed by a first-order dynamical transition. We then demonstrate this relation explicitly in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, using an auxiliary-spin representation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy that exhibits an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry. We further find that, in the high-temperature regime of the SYK model, the transition occurs at a finite time, with the long-time phase marked by spontaneous $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. In contrast, at low temperatures, the transition is pushed to times exponentially long in the system size. Our results reveal an intriguing interplay between quantum chaos and quantum magic.</p>

            <p>Laser hardening of metals occurs under the influence of a shock wave, which changes the distribution and density of one-dimensional defects - dislocations. There is a relationship between the density of dislocations, the grain size and the resistance of a single crystal to shear loading. The mechanism of hardening processes continues to be intensively studied, and the dynamics of defects plays a central role here. In this paper, the dislocation entropy is analyzed from a combinatorial point of view and from the point of view of a physical oscillator with a given energy reserve. Both contributions play an important role in describing the free energy of a one-dimensional ensemble of dislocations, and are necessary to take into account the dynamic processes inside the grain of a polycrystalline structure.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Don MacMillen</p>
            <p>Two of the most iconic systems of quantum physics are the particle in a box and the Coulomb potential (the third is, of course, the harmonic oscillator). In this expository paper, we consider the quantum solution to the problem of an electron confined between the grounded planes of an infinite capacitor. The potential arises from the image charges that form in the grounded planes, along with the added condition that at x = 0, L, where L is the distance between the planes, the wavefunction must be zero. This effectively couples a hydrogen like system to a particle-in-a-box (PIB) based on L, the distance between the planes. The problem of finding the electrostatic potential of this infinite series of image charges is an old one, going back to at least 1929. Here, we give a short derivation for one of the limiting cases that yields a compact expression and show how the Kellogg infinite summation formula converges to that value. We note here that this potential is a symmetric double well potential, so there will be many familiar properties of its solutions. Then using that potential, we solve Schrödinger's equation using a spectral technique. The limiting forms of a particle in a box for small L (and high E), and that of a (degenerate) bound image charge at large L and small energy are recovered. We also discuss the tunneling level splitting that occurs in the transition from the large L to the small L regime.</p>

            <p>Stochastic resetting describes dynamics which are reinitialized to a reference state at random times. These protocols are attracting significant interest: they can stabilize nonequilibrium stationary states, generate correlations in noninteracting systems, and enable optimal search strategies. While a constant reset probability results in a Markovian dynamics, much less is known about non-Markovian effects in quantum stochastic resetting. Here, we analyze memory effects in these processes -- examining the evolution of quantum states and of observables -- through witnesses of non-Markovianity for open quantum systems. We focus on discrete-time reset processes, which are of particular interest as they can be implemented on existing gate-operated quantum devices. We show that these processes are generically described by non-divisible maps and, in non-classical scenarios where the effective reset probability can become negative, can feature revivals in the state distinguishability. Our results reveal non-Markovian effects in quantum stochastic resetting and show that a time-dependent reset may be exploited to engineer enhanced stationary quantum correlations.</p>

            <p>Multiphase fluid flows comprising of mesoscale solid particles, liquid droplets, or gas bubbles are common in both natural and man-made systems, but quantifying the energy transfer is challenging due to complex bubble-particle interactions. In this study, we used ultrafast synchrotron X-ray imaging to study the mesoscale dynamic interactions among ultrasonic cavitation bubbles and hydrophobic particles or clusters. Critical dynamic information and data were extracted from the vast amount of X-ray images and then fed into the hybrid analytical-numerical model for calculating the energy transfer from the oscillating bubble and the imploding bubble to the nearby hydrophobic particles. Using the Ni spherical microparticles as an example, at bubble oscillation approximately 16% (80-320 nJ) of the local energy was transferred to the particle. At bubble implosion, the transferred energy increased approximately 26% (0.135-1.09 uJ). Local energy transfer occurred on timescales of 1 us to 1 ms and length scales of 1 um to 1 mm. Within each ultrasound cycle, kinetic and potential energy underwent complex exchanges, with local energy exhibiting a stepwise decay at the end of each cycle. The transferred energy was mainly consumed for enabling highly efficient particle dispersion. This research provides quantitative insights into optimizing hydrophobic nanomaterial dispersion and has broader implications for interfacial energy transfer processes such as making suspensions, composite materials and exfoliated 2D materials.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate deterministic control of branched flow of light using anisotropic nematic liquid crystals. By sculpting the director field via photoalignment, we create spatially programmable optical potentials that govern light scattering and propagation. This platform enables configurable, anisotropic branched flow of light and reveals a universal scaling law for its characteristic features, directly connecting disordered photonics with mesoscopic wave transport. Under extreme anisotropy, we observe a pronounced directional channeling effect, driven by anomalous symmetry-breaking velocity diffusion, which concentrates light propagation along preferential directions while suppressing transverse spreading. These findings establish a tunable material platform for harnessing branched flow of light, opening pathways toward on-chip photonic circuits that exploit disorder-guided transport, scattering-resilient endoscopic imaging, and adaptive optical interfaces in complex media.</p>

            <h2>Interpretable, Physics-Informed Learning Reveals Sulfur Adsorption and Poisoning Mechanisms in 13-Atom Icosahedra Nanoclusters</h2>

            <p>Transition-metal nanoclusters exhibit structural and electronic properties that depend on their size, often making them superior to bulk materials for heterogeneous catalysis. However, their performance can be limited by sulfur poisoning. Here, we use dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) and physics-informed machine learning to map how atomic sulfur adsorbs and causes poisoning on 13-atom icosahedral clusters from 30 different transition metals (3$d$ to 5$d$). We measure which sites sulfur prefers to adsorb to, the thermodynamics and energy breakdown, changes in structure, such as bond lengths and coordination, and electronic properties, such as $\varepsilon_d$, the HOMO-LUMO gap, and charge transfer. Vibrational analysis reveals true energy minima and provides ZPE-based descriptors that reflect the lattice stiffening upon sulfur adsorption. For most metals, the metal-sulfur interaction mainly determines adsorption energy. At the same time, distortion penalties are usually moderate but can be significant for a few metals, suggesting these are more likely to restructure when sulfur is adsorbed. Using unsupervised \textit{k}-means clustering, we identify periodic trends and group metals based on their adsorption responses. Supervised regression models with leave-one-feature-out analysis identify the descriptors that best predict adsorption for new samples. Our results highlight the isoelectronic triad \ce{Ti}, \ce{Zr}, and \ce{Hf} as a balanced group that combines strong sulfur binding with minimal structural change. Additional DFT calculations for \ce{SO2} adsorption reveal strong binding and a clear tendency toward dissociation on these clusters, linking electronic states, lattice response, and poisoning strength. These findings offer data-driven guidelines for designing sulfur-tolerant nanocatalysts at the subnanometer scale.</p>

Our calculations confirm the tendency of a particulate ensemble to the universal particle-volume distribution to be approached asymptotically after a sufficiently long time, no matter what the initial particle-volume distribution might be.</p>

            <p>Understanding the entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems under steady-state transport conditions is an actively pursued challenging topic. Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed "information lattice" framework, we characterize spatially and scale-resolved information currents in nonequilibrium open quantum systems. Specifically, using Lindblad master equations, we consider noninteracting fermion chains coupled to dissipative reservoirs. By relating the information lattice to a noise lattice constructed from particle-number fluctuations, we show that information is experimentally accessible via noise easurements. Similarly, local information currents can be obtained by measuring particle currents, onsite occupations, and covariances of particle numbers and/or particle currents. Using the fermionic negativity to quantify bipartite entanglement, we also study transport-induced entanglement and its relation to information currents. For a clean particle-hole symmetric chain, we find that information currents are shielded from entering the information lattice. Impurities or particle-hole asymmetry break this effect, causing information current flow and entanglement between end segments of the chain. Our work opens the door to systematic investigations of information transport and entanglement generation in driven open quantum systems far from equilibrium.</p>

            <p>Stochastic kinetic models describe systems across biology, chemistry, and physics where discrete events and small populations render deterministic approximations inadequate. Parameter inference and inverse design in these systems require optimizing over trajectories generated by the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, but the discrete reaction events involved are inherently non-differentiable. We present an approach based on straight-through Gumbel-Softmax estimation that maintains exact stochastic simulations in the forward pass while approximating gradients through a continuous relaxation applied only in the backward pass. We demonstrate robust performance on parameter inference in stochastic gene expression, accurately recovering kinetic rates of telegraph promoter models from both moment statistics and full steady-state distributions across diverse and challenging parameter regimes. We further demonstrate the method's applicability to inverse design problems in stochastic thermodynamics, characterizing Pareto-optimal trade-offs between non-equilibrium currents and entropy production. The ability to efficiently differentiate through exact stochastic simulations provides a foundation for systematic inference and rational design across the many domains governed by continuous-time Markov dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Locality forces equal energy spacing of quantum many-body scar towers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas O'Dea, Lei Gioia, Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei I. Motrunich</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars are non-thermal eigenstates embedded in the spectra of otherwise non-integrable Hamiltonians. Paradigmatic examples often appear as quasiparticle towers of states, such as the maximally ferromagnetic spin-1/2 states, also known as Dicke states. A distinguishing feature of quantum many-body scars is that they admit multiple local "parent" Hamiltonians for which they are exact eigenstates. In this work, we show that the locality of such parent Hamiltonians strongly constrains the relative placement of these states within the energy spectrum. In particular, we prove that if the full set of Dicke states are exact eigenstates of an extensive local Hamiltonian, then their energies must necessarily be equally spaced. Our proof builds on recent results concerning parent Hamiltonians of the $W$ state, together with general algebraic structures underlying such quasiparticle towers. We further demonstrate that this equal spacing property extends to local Hamiltonians defined on arbitrary bounded-degree graphs, including regular lattices in any spatial dimension and expander graphs. Hamiltonians with $k$-local interactions and a bounded number of interaction terms per site are also encompassed by our proof. On the same classes of graphs, we additionally establish equal spacing for towers constructed from multi-site quasiparticles on top of product states. For the towers considered here, an immediate corollary of the equal spacing property is that any state initialized entirely within the quantum many-body scar manifold exhibits completely frozen entanglement dynamics under any local Hamiltonian for which those scars are exact eigenstates. Overall, our results reveal a stringent interplay between locality and the structure of quantum many-body scars.</p>

            <h2>Superradiant phase transitions in one-dimensional correlated Fermi gases with cavity-induced umklapp scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Song Pan</p>
            <p>The superradiant phase transitions of one-dimensional correlated Fermi gases in a transversely driven optical cavity, under the umklapp condition that the cavity wave number is equal to two times the Fermi wave number, are studied with bosonization and renormalization group techniques. The bosonization of Fermi fields gives rise to an all-to-all sine-Gordon (SG) model due to the cavity-assisted nonlocal interactions, where the Bose fields at any two spatial points are coupled. The superradiant phase transition is then mapped to the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition of the all-to-all SG model. The nesting effect, in which the superradiant phase transition can be triggered by an infinitely small atom-cavity coupling strength, is shown to be preserved for any nonattractive local interactions. For attractive local interactions, the phase transition occurs at a finite critical coupling strength. Nevertheless, the analysis of the scaling dimension indicates that the perturbation of the nonlocal cosine term is indeed relevant (irrelevant) when the scaling dimension is lower (higher) than the critical dimension, similar to the case of an ordinary local SG model. Our work provides an analytical framework for understanding the superradiant phase transitions in low-dimensional correlated intracavity Fermi gases.</p>

            <p>We report calculations of terahertz ellipticities in large-angle, 21.79$^\circ$ and 38.21$^\circ$, commensurate twisted bilayer graphene, and predict values as high as 1.5 millidegrees in the terahertz region for this non-magnetic material. This terahertz circular dichroism exhibits a magnitude comparable to that of chiral materials in the visible region. At low frequencies, the dichroic response is mediated by strong interlayer hybridization, which allows us to probe the symmetry and strength of these couplings. Crucially, lateral interlayer translation tunes this response, in contrast to small twist angle bilayer graphene's near invariance under under interlayer translation. We examine the magnitude and phase of the interlayer coupling for all structures containing fewer than 400 atoms per unit cell. Finally, we find that the dichroism can be manipulated by applying an electric field or with doping.</p>

            <h2>Instability cascades in crumpling mylar sheets follow a log-Poisson statistic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Boettcher, Paula A. Gago</p>
            <p>The process of aging following a hard quench into a glassy state is characterized universally, for a wide class of materials, by logarithmic evolution of state variables and a power-law decay of two-time correlation functions that collapse only for the ratio of those times. This stands in stark contrast with relaxation in equilibrium materials, where time-translational invariance holds. It is by now widely recognized that these aging processes, which ever so slowly relax a complex disordered material after a quench, are facilitated by activated events. Yet, theories often cited to describe such a non-equilibrium process can be shown to miss pertinent aspects that are inherent to many experiments. A case in point are recent experiments on crumpling sheets of mylar loaded by a weight whose acoustic emissions are measured while the material buckles. Using extensive simulations to generate long time-series of such buckling events, we show that crumpling is a log-Poisson process activated by increasingly rare record-sized fluctuations in a slowly stiffening material characterized by a logarithmically growing length-scale. Crumpling thus adds to a range of glassy materials exhibiting the log-Poisson property, which can be used to discriminate between theories.</p>

            <p>In altermagnets, time-reversal symmetry breaking spin-polarizes electronic states, while total magnetization remains zero. In addition, at altermagnetic surfaces Rashba-spin orbit coupling is activated due to broken inversion symmetry, introducing a competing spin-momentum locking interaction. Here we show that their interplay leads to the formation of complex, chiral spin textures that offer novel, non-linear spin-to-charge conversion properties. Whereas altermagnetic order suppresses the canonical linear in-plane Rashba-Edelstein response, we establish the presence of an \textit{anomalous} transversal Edelstein effect for planar applied electric and magnetic field, or alternatively, an in-plane magnetization. Additionally, we predict a purely electric-field-driven non-linear out-of-plane magnetization. We compute the anomalous response within a general altermagnet $d$-wave model, with parameters extracted from the ab-initio electronic structure of an altermagnetic bilayer. Our results suggest altermagnetic surfaces as a promising platform for unconventional spintronic functionalities.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has provided new perspectives on the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase, so the discovery of new superconducting RP nickelates is highly desirable to reveal their generality. Here we report that high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal is grown with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure. High-pressure transport measurements show that the superconducting state arises above 10 GPa, and the maximum Tc reaches 39 K without saturation, significantly exceeding the value of 25-30 K of La4Ni3O10. Ultrasensitive d.c. magnetic susceptibility measurements under high pressure indicate bulk superconductivity with appreciable superconducting volume fractions. By performing in situ high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements at 16 K, a structural transition is found from monoclinic to tetragonal. Unlike La4Ni3O10, the electronic structure of the high-pressure phase of Pr4Ni3O10 from density functional theory exhibits a dramatic metallization of the sigma-bonding band consisting of three dz2 orbitals and van Hove singularity of coupled bands of dx2-y2 orbitals near the Fermi level, similar to the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7. These findings reveal some generic features of both crystal and electronic structures for high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates and multi-layer cuprates.</p>

            <p>We propose a data-driven Machine-Learning Symmetry Discovery (MLSD) framework for identifying continuous symmetry generators and their Lie-algebraic structure directly from phase-space trajectory data expressed in canonical coordinates. MLSD parameterizes candidate conserved quantities with neural networks and learns antisymmetric structure coefficients by enforcing Poisson-bracket closure, supplemented by a weak independence regularizer. We validate MLSD on two integrable benchmark systems -- the three-dimensional Kepler problem and the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator -- recovering the expected non-Abelian algebras (respectively $\mathfrak{so}(4)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$) up to basis transformations. This work focuses on integrable benchmark dynamics, where global conserved quantities are well-defined and admit compact representations learnable from canonical-coordinate trajectories. Extending symmetry discovery to mixed or chaotic phase-space regimes is an important direction for future work.</p>

            <p>We investigate the chiral dynamics of locally interacting bosons in a two-leg flux ladder, where on-site interactions, despite being fully isotropic, counterintuitively reverse the flux-induced chiral transport of density distribution. For a Bose-Einstein condensate (in the mean-field regime), this reversal arises from an interactiondriven dynamical band-occupation inversion, which selectively populates single-particle states of the opposing chirality. Strikingly, the chiral-transport inversion has a few-body, hence beyond-mean-field, origin, as the formation of two-body bound states with reversed chirality dominates the few-body dynamics. This dual pathway, that is, occupation inversion and bound-state formation, underlies the chiral-transport inversion, which challenges the conventional wisdom that isotropic interactions cannot bias density transport. Our work reveals the interplay between interactions and chirality and highlights how correlations engineer exotic quantum transport.</p>

First, we identify a smooth path of gapped symmetric Hamiltonians whose ground states transform inequivalently under the symmetry. Second, we find a model where a product state and the so-called W state spontaneously break the symmetry, and propose an explanation for the indistinguishability of these two states in the infinite-volume limit in terms of the symmetry category.</p>

            <p>Signatures of unconventional superconductivity have been recently observed in certain transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), including 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ and monolayer 2H-NbSe$_2$. While the pairing channel remains unknown, it has been argued that spin fluctuations can stabilize pairing in the two-component $E'$ channel, a $p$-wave spin-triplet state which could be consistent with some of the reported signatures. Exploiting the particular multi-orbital character of the Fermi surface and the presence of Ising spin-orbit coupling, which enable finite optical conductivity in the clean limit, in this work we predict clear-cut optical signatures to detect and distinguish the chiral and nematic ground states of the $E'$ pairing. We quantify how nematic $E'$ states produce a diagonal anisotropy $\sigma_{xx}\!\neq\!\sigma_{yy}$ due to the broken threefold symmetry ($C_3$), while chiral $E'$ states yield a finite optical Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}^H$ due to broken time-reversal symmetry, and find both signals could be detected in current experiments. For instance, for realistic gaps in the meV range, we predict a relative anisotropy $\Delta\sigma/\sigma\sim10^{-5}$ in the nematic states, and a polar Kerr rotation of $\theta_K\!\sim\!10^{-5}$ rad in the chiral states. These symmetry fingerprints provide a practical route to distinguish nematic and chiral superconducting order in TMD superconductors.</p>

Although altermagnetic states have been realized experimentally, their integration into functional devices has been hindered by the structural rigidity and poor tunability of existing materials. First, through cobalt intercalation of the superconducting 2H-NbSe$_2$ polymorph, we induce and stabilize a robust altermagnetic phase and using both theory and experiment, we directly observe the lifting of Kramers degeneracy. Additionally, we present spectroscopic insight into a previously hinted low-temperature phase, and provide evidence of its electronic origin.

            <p>High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying material properties and ultra-fast electron dynamics, where its coherent character is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we uncover a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs. inter-band contributions. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space in gapped systems with both linear dispersion, such as for massive Dirac Fermions, and with quadratic dispersion, as e.g. for bilayer graphene. Moreover, we demonstrate that, upon increasing dephasing, destructive interference between intra- and inter-band contributions is lifted. This leads to reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics, i.e. a crossover from the characteristic spectral "shoulder" to a slowly decaying signal involving much higher harmonics. We supplement our numerical observations with analytical results for the one-dimensional case.</p>

            <p>Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.</p>

            <p>Electronic flicker noise limits phase stability in communication systems, reduces the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors, and degrades coherence in quantum devices. There is a strong need for unconventional materials and strategies for achieving ultra-low-noise performance in nanoscale and quantum electronics. Here, we demonstrate that in nanowires of the quasi-one-dimensional, fully gapped charge-density-wave material (TaSe4)2I, low-frequency electronic noise is suppressed below the limit of thermalized charge carriers in passive resistors. When the current is dominated by the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density decreases linearly with current, I -- a striking departure from the constant value observed in conventional conductors. No residual minimum noise level is reached for the current of the electron-lattice condensate in (TaSe4)2I nanowires. Repeating the measurements for another charge-density wave conductor, NbS3-II, we found a similar reduction below the normal electron limit at room temperature. Our findings signal intrinsically lower current fluctuations within a correlated electron transport regime.</p>

            <h2>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Doried Ghader, Bilal Jabakhanji</p>
            <p>Magnons have been intensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on Bravais lattices, particularly triangular and square lattices. In these systems, topological edge states (TESs) have been reported in higher-energy magnon gaps, while the first magnon gap is found to be topologically trivial. In this context, antiferromagnetic (AFM) SkXs on the triangular spin lattice have been considered potentially more interesting for applications, since TESs emerge already in the first magnon gap. Meanwhile, the magnon topology of SkXs stabilized on non-Bravais spin lattices remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate the magnon band structure and TESs in 2D FM SkXs stabilized on the honeycomb spin lattice, including experimentally motivated parameter sets relevant to van der Waals magnets. We show that chiral TESs emerge in the first magnon gap over significant ranges of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Magnetic-field-driven topological phase transitions modify the number of these TESs before eventually trivializing them. In addition, we find that TESs can coexist in the first and higher magnon gaps, which could enable frequency-multiplexed magnonic edge transport. These findings highlight the role of lattice geometry in shaping the magnon topology and edge transport in noncollinear spin textures.</p>

            <h2>Finite-temperature entanglement and coherence in asymmetric bosonic Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Vianello, Matteo Ferraretto, Luca Salasnich</p>
            <p>We investigate the finite-temperature properties of a bosonic Josephson junction composed of N interacting atoms confined by a quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric double-well potential, modeled by the two-site Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We compute numerically the spectral decomposition of the statistical ensemble of states, the thermodynamic and entanglement entropies, the population imbalance, the quantum Fisher information, and the coherence visibility. We analyze their dependence on the system parameters, showing in particular how finite temperature and on-site energy asymmetry affect the entanglement and coherence properties of the system. Moreover, starting from a quantum phase model which accurately describes the system over a wide range of interactions, we develop a reliable description of the strong tunneling regime, where thermal averages may be computed analytically using a modified Boltzmann weight involving an effective temperature. We discuss the possibility of applying this effective description to other models in suitable regimes.</p>

            <h2>Going beyond density functional theory accuracy: Leveraging experimental data to refine pre-trained machine learning interatomic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shriya Gumber, Lorena Alzate-Vargas, Benjamin T. Nebgen, Arjen van Veelen, Smit Kadvani, Tammie Gibson, Richard Messerly</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are inherently limited by the accuracy of the training data, usually consisting of energies and forces obtained from quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT). Since DFT itself is based on several approximations, MLIPs may inherit systematic errors that lead to discrepancies with experimental data. In this paper, we use a trajectory re-weighting technique to refine DFT pre-trained MLIPs to match the target experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra. EXAFS spectra are sensitive to the local structural environment around an absorbing atom. Thus, refining an MLIP to improve agreement with experimental EXAFS spectra also improves the MLIP prediction of other structural properties that are not directly involved in the refinement process. We combine this re-weighting technique with transfer learning and a minimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting to the limited experimental data. The refinement approach demonstrates significant improvement for two MLIPs reported in previous work, one for an established nuclear fuel: uranium dioxide (UO2) and second one for a nuclear fuel candidate: uranium mononitride (UN). We validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the results obtained from the original (unrefined) DFT-based MLIP and the EXAFS-refined MLIP across various properties, such as lattice parameters, bulk modulus, heat capacity, point defect energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion spectra, and diffusion coefficients. An accurate MLIP for nuclear fuels is extremely beneficial as it enables reliable atomistic simulation, which greatly reduces the need for large number of expensive and inherently dangerous experimental nuclear integral tests, traditionally required for the qualification of efficient and resilient fuel candidates.</p>

            <h2>Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiang Gao, Zhaoyu Han, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, we find that the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</p>

            <h2>Marginal Metals and Kosterlitz-Thouless Type Phase Transition in Disordered Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-An Li, Bo Fu, Huaiming Guo, Björn Trauzettel, Song-Bo Zhang</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism, a recently discovered magnetic phase characterized by spin-split bands without net magnetization, has emerged as promising platform for novel physics and potential applications. However, its stability against disorder-ubiquitous in real materials-remains poorly understood. Here, we study the electron localization properties of two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets subject to disorder. Remarkably, we discover a disorder-driven phase transition from a marginal metallic phase to an insulator, which falls into the Kosterlitz-Thouless class. We demonstrate this by strong numerical evidence and propose an interpretation in terms of vortex-antivortex pairs in the disorder-induced local in-plane spin magnetization. Moreover, we show that the characteristic spin anisotropy of altermagnets persists but gradually fades away across the transition. These changes directly affect the spin splitting features that are detectable in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and tunneling magnetoconductance. Our findings provide a new perspective on recent experimental observations of altermagnetism in candidate materials.</p>

            <h2>Perturbative renormalization group approach to magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene using topological heavy fermion model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Huang, Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>We develop a perturbative renormalization group (RG) theory for the topological heavy fermion (THF) model, describing magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) as an emergent Anderson lattice. Our theory focuses on an energy window where the interactions can be treated perturbatively within the THF model, providing insights into the low-energy physics. In particular, the realistic parameters place MATBG near an intermediate regime where the Hubbard interaction $U$ and the hybridization energy $\gamma$ are comparable, motivating the need for RG analysis. Our approach analytically tracks the flow of single-particle parameters and Coulomb interactions within an energy window below $0.1$ eV, providing implications for distinguishing between Kondo-like ($U\gg \gamma$) and projected-limit/Mott-semimetal ($U\ll \gamma$) scenarios at low energies. We show that the RG flows generically lower the ratio $U/\gamma$ and drive MATBG toward the chiral limit, consistent with the previous numerical study based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald model. The framework presented here also applies to other moiré systems and stoichiometric materials that admit a THF description, including magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, twisted checkerboard model, and Lieb lattice, among others, providing a foundation for developing low-energy effective theories relevant to a broad class of topological flat-band materials.</p>

            <h2>Realistic modelling of transport properties at finite temperature in magnetic materials by local quantization of a Heisenberg model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Engelke, Christian Heiliger</p>
            <p>The quantitative description of the electrical resistivity of a magnetic material remains challenging to this day. Qualitatively, it is well understood that the temperature-induced lattice and spin disorder determines the temperature dependence of the resistivity. While prior publications reached good agreement with experiment in the so-called supercell or direct approach for non-magnetic materials where the spin-disorder contribution to the resistivity is negligible, an accurate, purely theoretical description of magnetic materials remains elusive. This shortcoming can be attributed to the missing accuracy in the description of the temperature-dependent spin-disorder itself. In this work, we employ a joint approach from \textit{ab-initio} transport calculations and atomistic modeling of the temperature-dependent spin-disorder. Using the example of $\alpha$-Fe, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum mechanical effects using a semiclassical local quantization of the Heisenberg model significantly improves the description of the spin-disorder component to the electrical resistivity. Compared to previous approaches, this model includes the description of magnetic short-range order effects, enabling us to study temperature effects around and above the Curie temperature, where prior mean-field theory-based approaches inevitably predicted a constant contribution.</p>

            <h2>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenze Fan, Juan Wang, Yan Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the formation of moire quasicrystal patterns in Bose gasses confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the total density wave amplitude exhibit the stage for the emergence of moire quasicrystal patterns, where the pattern formation is closely associated with the momenta of collective modes excited by the weak periodic drive. Through analyzing the radial and angular density wave amplitude, we find that these new collective modes are only coupled radially and cannot be decoupled eventually. The symmetry of quasicrystal patterns can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moire quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary Wolfgram, Jeffrey G. Ethier, Matthew Grasinger</p>
            <p>Electro-viscoelastic polymers have been studied experimentally for the past century, primarily for manufacturing purposes; however, the mechanisms governing their behavior in combined flow and electric fields remain poorly understood. To address this, we model charged polymers across scales. We extend the Rouse model to include charge density along the polymer chain and ambient electric fields, deriving the shear stress under homogeneous shear and electric fields. Viscosity exhibits anisotropic enhancement dependent on field-flow orientation with a scaling factor dependent on a charge sequence relaxation time, dielectric constant, and quadratic electric field term. These results inform a new continuum model--the upper-convected electro-Maxwell (UCEM) model--resembling an upper-convected Maxwell model with polarization stresses expressed through an electric field dyadic subject to upper-convected time derivatives. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of Kremer-Grest chains with charge sequences reveal distinct relaxation timescales for overall chain dynamics versus charge redistribution, manifested in shear and normal stress responses. Critically, upper-convected time derivatives of the electric field dyadic reproduce the viscosity scaling observed in both the Rouse and MD results; while standard continuum formulations without these terms fail to capture the scaling. Analysis of the dynamic rheological properties show that the phase shift is unaffected by the electric field, in agreement with recent PMMA experiments.</p>

            <p>Coupled layer constructions are a valuable tool for capturing the universal properties of certain interacting quantum phases of matter in terms of the simpler data that characterizes the underlying layers. In the study of fracton phases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by starting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which condenses a composite "particle-string" object. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. B 112, 125124 (2025)], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can be viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper, we study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging web relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases protected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry fractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of topological symmetries by subsystem symmetries. Our work emphasizes the importance of topological symmetries in non-topological, geometric phases of matter.</p>

            <p>Controlling nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials requires ultrafast probes with spectral selectivity. We report femtosecond reflectivity measurements on the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ using free-electron laser extreme-ultraviolet (23.5--177~eV) and near-infrared (1.5~eV) pump pulses. EUV pulses access deep electronic states, while NIR light excites valence-band transitions. Despite these distinct channels, both schemes produce nearly identical dynamics: above $T_c$, excitations relax through fast (100--300~fs) and slower (1--5~ps) channels; below $T_c$, a delayed component signals quasiparticle recombination and condensate recovery. We find that when electronic excitations are involved, the ultrafast response is governed mainly by absorbed energy rather than by the microscopic nature of the excitation. In contrast, bosonic driving in the THz or mid-infrared produces qualitatively different dynamics. By demonstrating that EUV excitation of a correlated superconductor yields macroscopic dynamics converging with those from optical pumping, this work defines a new experimental paradigm: FEL pulses at core-level energies provide a powerful means to probe and control nonequilibrium electronic states in quantum materials on their intrinsic femtosecond timescales. This establishes FEL-based EUV pumping as a new capability for ultrafast materials science, opening routes toward soft X-ray and attosecond studies of correlated dynamics.</p>

            <p>Over the past decade, the field of high-entropy ceramics (HECs) has expanded rapidly to encompass a broad range of oxides, borides, silicides, and other ceramic solid solutions. In 2020, we proposed extending HECs to compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs), where non-equimolar compositions and the presence of long- or short-range order, although reducing configurational entropy, create new opportunities to tailor and enhance properties, often surpassing those of higher-entropy counterparts. Along these lines, several fundamental scientific questions arise. Is the entropy in HECs truly high? Is maximizing entropy always desirable? In this perspective article, I revisit key concepts and terminologies and highlight emerging directions, including dual-phase CCCs, ultrahigh-entropy phases, and novel processing routes such as ultrafast reactive sintering. I propose that exploring compositional complexity across vast non-equimolar spaces, together with exploiting correlated disorder (coupled chemical and structural short-range order), represents a transformative strategy for designing ceramics with superior performance.</p>

            <p>Recent studies on spin-wave propagation in ferromagnetic waveguides has highlighted the role of nonreciprocity resulting from the chiral nature of dipolar interactions in curved elements. However, the impact of spin-wave mode type on nonreciprocity remains unexplored. Using micromagnetic simulations supported by analytical modeling, we systematically analyzed the propagation of edge, fundamental, and width-quantized spin-wave modes in a ferromagnetic nanowire with a crescent-shaped cross-section. Our results show that the strength and sign of nonreciprocity depend on the mode type, as well as on the curvature magnitude of the nanowire's top and bottom surfaces and the strength of the external magnetic field. Interestingly, changing the mode type, for instance induced by altering the curvature or magnetic field, result in a significant change in the dispersion relation asymmetry. This effect underscores the important role of spin-wave profiles in nonreciprocity, deepens our fundamental understanding of spin-wave dynamics in curved geometries, and paves the way for designing magnonic waveguides with tailored properties.</p>

            <p>We aim to clarify the confusion and inconsistency in our recent works [1,2], and to address the incompleteness therein. In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints is BRST-exact in our theory. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p>

            <p>This paper is devoted to the problem of identification of colloidal assemblies using the example of two-dimensional coatings (monolayer assemblies). Colloidal systems are used in various fields of science and technology, for example, in applications for photonics and functional coatings. The physical properties depend on the morphology of the structure of the colloidal assemblies. Therefore, effective identification of particle assemblies is of interest. The following classification is considered here: isolated particles, dimers, chains and clusters. We have studied and compared two identification methods: image threshold analysis using the OpenCV library and machine learning using the YOLOv8 model as an example. The features and current results of training a neural network model on a dataset specially prepared for this work are described. A comparative characteristic of both methods is given. The best result was shown by the machine learning method (97% accuracy). The threshold processing method showed an accuracy of about 67%. The developed algorithms and software modules may be useful to scientists and engineers working in the field of materials science in the future.</p>

            <p>Recent research has shown that memory, in the form of slow degrees of freedom, can induce a phase of long-range order (LRO) in locally-coupled fast degrees of freedom, producing power-law distributions of avalanches. In fact, such memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems. Here, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no memory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with local feedforward couplings: only the first layer contains memory, while downstream layers are memory-free and locally interacting. Analytical arguments and simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling downstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor long-range interactions. This establishes a simple, yet generic mechanism for propagating collective activity through media without fine tuning to criticality, with testable implications for neuromorphic systems and laminar information flow in the brain cortex.</p>

            <p>In this study, we theoretically investigated the magnetic properties of the quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$ using a multi-band Hubbard model and the two-particle self-consistent method. We employed a four-band model in which each BETS molecule is considered as a site and a two-band model that considers each BETS dimer as a site. Our results for the temperature dependence of the Stoner factor reveal a kink around $T_\mathrm{kink} \approx 5 \mathrm{meV}$, which indicates a change in the dominant magnetic fluctuations. A broad structure indicating smeared antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations was observed above $T_\mathrm{kink}$, whereas the spin susceptibility peaked at a wavevector corresponding to spin-density-wave (SDW)-like fluctuations below $T_\mathrm{kink}$. The kink disappears as the intra-dimer transfer integral increased and the AFM fluctuations were enhanced. Our findings are consistent with those of previous experimental observations, which have also reported a change in magnetic properties from AFM to SDW-like fluctuations upon cooling.</p>

These subtleties emerge when evaluating path integrals in the continuum, either in imaginary time or in Matsubara-frequency space.

We illustrate this through a pedagogical treatment of several paradigmatic systems: the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillators, the single-site Bose-Hubbard and Hubbard models, the weakly-interacting Bose gas with finite-range interactions, and the BCS superconductor with finite-range interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerardo Aquino, Mauro Bologna</p>
            <p>We study the diffusion of a charged particle in a magnetic field subject to stochastic dichotomous fluctuations. The associated induced electric field gives rise to non-trivial dynamical regimes. In particular, when the mean magnetic field vanishes, the particle remains confined within a finite radius, regardless of the fluctuation statistics. For a non-zero mean field, we show, using a density approach for Poissonian fluctuations, that the particle undergoes an exponential regime of accelerated diffusion. Crucially and more generally, adopting a trajectory-based formalism, we derive an exact analytical solution valid for arbitrary waiting-time distributions, including non-Poissonian and non-ergodic cases. Even rare, abrupt field reversal are shown to trigger exponential acceleration of the particle's diffusion. We demonstrate that this behaviour stems from noise exciting resonance bands present for periodic fluctuations, and we propose noise-induced resonant acceleration as a robust and efficient charge acceleration mechanism, potentially more effective than Fermi's classic model for cosmic acceleration.</p>

            <p>The percolation, Ising, and O($n$) models constitute fundamental systems in statistical and condensed matter physics. For short-range-interacting cases, the nature of their phase transitions is well established by renormalization-group theory. However, the universality of the transitions in these models remains elusive when algebraically decaying long-range interactions $\sim 1/r^{d+\sigma}$ are introduced, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $\sigma$ is the decay exponent. Building upon insights from Lévy flight, i.e., long-range simple random walk, we propose three universality diagrams in the $(d,\sigma)$ plane for the percolation model, the O($n$) model, and the Fortuin-Kasteleyn Ising model, respectively. The conjectured universality diagrams are consistent with recent high-precision numerical studies and rigorous mathematical results, offering a unified perspective on critical phenomena in systems with long-range interactions.</p>

            <p>The study of the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules has long remained a hot topic in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. However, most prior research has focused on diatomic molecules, with relatively scarce exploration of polyatomic molecules. Here we propose a two-step strategy for the formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules. We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetratomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state. Through systematic numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed two-step strategy holds great potential for the robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules.</p>

            <h2>A unified model for underdoped and overdoped cuprate superconductors based on a spinodal transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hercules H. Santana, E. V. L. de Mello</p>
            <p>Many years of intense research on cuprate superconductors have led to several discoveries, such as the pseudogap and charge density waves (CDW), yet a complete theory is still lacking. By analyzing some experiments and performing calculations, we provide a full interpretation of their properties; from the undoped insulator to the overdoped metallic compounds. The variation of the anomalous Hall coefficient ($R_{\rm H}(T)$) with temperature at half-filling ($n = 1$) and, combinations of undoped ($p = 0$) insulators and metallic films, which, among other things, are indicative of a thermodynamic transition. On the overdoped side, recent experiments near the superconducting-to-metal transition detecting superconducting puddles and a considerable degree of charge disorder, suggest that a similar thermodynamic transition operates at all doping levels. We propose a spinodal or charge-separation transition starting near the pseudogap temperature $T^*(p)$, which among other things generates the CDW domains with a typical double-well Landau free-energy functional. Thus, from the half-filled to the overdoped region, the free energy forms an array of wells with $n = 1$ {\it static} holes. With doping, {\it mobile} holes tend to occupy these wells with alternating high and low densities, generating the CDW pattern. The confined holes in small regions develop local superconducting amplitudes, giving rise to a mesoscopic granular superconductor. Similar to the XY model, the grains develop correlation effects mediated by Josephson coupling, which is proportional to the local superfluid density. This approach yields a unified theory of cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Quasi-two-dimensional soliton in a self-repulsive spin-orbit-coupled dipolar binary condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. K. Adhikari</p>
            <p>We study the formation of solitons in a uniform quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) spin-orbit (SO) coupled self-repulsive binary dipolar and nondipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For a weak SO coupling, in a nondipolar BEC, one can have three types of degenerate solitons: a multi-ring soliton with intrinsic vorticity of angular momentum projection $+1$ or $-1$ in one component and 0 in the other, a circularly-asymmetric soliton and a stripe soliton with stripes in the density. For an intermediate SO couplings, the multi-ring soliton ceases to exist and there appears a square-lattice soliton with a spatially-periodic pattern in density on a square lattice, in addition to the degenerate circularly-asymmetric and stripe solitons. In the presence of a dipolar interaction, with the polarization direction aligned in the quasi-2D plane, only the degenerate circularly-asymmetric and stripe solitons appear.</p>

            <h2>Geometry induced net spin polarization of $d$-wave altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhiram Soori</p>
            <p>Altermagnets exhibit spin-split electronic bandstructures despite having zero net magnetization, making them attractive for field-free spintronic applications. In this work, we show that a finite rectangular altermagnetic sample can acquire a net spin polarization purely due to its geometry. This effect arises from the interplay between the anisotropic, spin-resolved Fermi contours of an altermagnet and the discrete sampling of momentum space imposed by unequal sample dimensions. By explicitly counting occupied states, we demonstrate that rectangular samples with $L_x \neq L_y$ host a finite spin polarization, which vanishes in the symmetric limit $L_x=L_y$ and in the thermodynamic limit. We further show that this geometry-induced spin polarization can be directly probed in transport measurements. In the tunneling regime, the charge and the spin conductances exhibit characteristic patterns as a function of sample dimensions, faithfully reflecting the underlying spin polarization. In addition, transport across ferromagnet--altermagnet--ferromagnet junctions reveals an asymmetric magnetoresistance with respect to reversal of the Zeeman field, providing an independent transport signature of the finite spin polarization. Our results establish geometry as an effective control parameter for spin polarization in altermagnets and suggest a viable route for exploiting finite-size effects in mesoscopic altermagnetic spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Continuum-Field-Theoretical Construction of Conserved Currents, Non-Invertible Symmetries, and Mixed Anomalies in (3+1)D Non-Abelian Topological Order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Feng Zhang, Yizhou Huang, Qing-Rui Wang, Peng Ye</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate generalized symmetries, with particular emphasis on non-invertible ones, in three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders hosting both particle- and loop-like excitations. We adopt a continuum topological field theory description, focusing on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a \wedge a \wedge b$ twisted term. This field theory supports Borromean-Rings braiding and realizes non-Abelian topological order, which for $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ admits a microscopic realization via the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double lattice model. We systematically identify all generalized symmetry operators by extracting conserved currents from the equations of motion. Two distinct classes of currents emerge: type-I currents, which generate invertible higher-form symmetries, and type-II currents, which give rise to non-invertible higher-form symmetries. The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability. We identify two types of mixed anomalies: one cancellable by topological field theories in one higher dimension, and another representing an intrinsic gauging obstruction encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum topological field theory.</p>

            <h2>Anderson Localization on Husimi Trees and its implications for Many-Body localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dafne Prado Bandeira, Marco Tarzia</p>
            <p>Motivated by the analogy between many-body localization (MBL) and single-particle Anderson localization on hierarchical graphs, we study localization on the Husimi tree, a generalization of the Bethe lattice with a finite density of local loops of arbitrary but finite length. The exact solution of the model provides a transparent and quantitative framework to systematically inspect the effect of loops on localization. Our analysis indicates that local loops enhance resonant processes, thereby reducing the critical disorder with increasing their number and size. At the same time, loops promote local hybridization, leading to an increase in the spatial extent of localized eigenstates. These effects reconcile key discrepancies between MBL phenomenology and its single-particle Anderson analog. These results show that local loops are a crucial structural ingredient for realistic single-particle analogies to many-body Hilbert spaces.</p>

            <p>Altermagnet (AM), a recently identified class of collinear magnet, has garnered significant attention due to its unique combination of zero net magnetization and spin-split energy bands, leading to a variety of novel physical phenomena. Using numerically exact lattice Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate AM-like phases within the Ising-Kondo lattice model which is commonly employed to describe heavy-fermion materials. By incorporating an alternating next-nearest-neighbor hopping (NNNH) term, which arises from the influence of non-magnetic atoms in altermagnetic candidate materials, our results reveal key signatures of AM-like states, including spin-splitting quasiparticle bands and spectral functions, and demonstrate that d-wave AM remains stable across a broad range of interaction strengths, doping levels, NNNH amplitudes and temperatures, highlighting its robustness. Furthermore, through an analysis of non-magnetic impurity effects, we further confirm the d-wave symmetry of the AM phase. These findings establish a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AM-like phases in f-electron compounds, paving the way for future investigations into their exotic magnetic and electronic properties.</p>

            <p>Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting resonators in quantum information science and precision measurements. Niobium resonators are widely used for these purposes, yet niobium's natural oxide stack contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits TLS-like power and temperature dependence. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels</p>

            <h2>Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koretaka Yuge</p>
            <p>When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale links to infinitesimal parameter variations.</p>

            <p>We systematically characterize the dynamical evolution of time-parity (PT )-symmetric two-level systems with spin-dependent dissipations. If the control parameters of the gap are linearly tuned with time, the dynamical evolution can be characterized with parabolic cylinder equations which can be analytically solved. We find that the asymptotic behaviors of particle probability on the two levels show initial-state-independent redistribution in the slow-tuning-speed limit as long as the system is nonadiabatically driven across exceptional points. Equal distributions appear when the nondissipative Hamiltonian shows gap closing. So long as the nondissipative Hamiltonian displays level anticrossing, the final distribution becomes unbalanced. The ratios between the occupation probabilities are given analytically. These results are confirmed with numerical simulations. The predicted equal distribution phenomenon may be used to identify the closing of the energy gap from anti-crossing between two energy bands.</p>

            <h2>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with O(1)-Local Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joel Rajakumar, James D. Watson</p>
            <p>Sampling from Gibbs states -- states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium -- has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements.</p>

            <p>We establish three impossibility results regarding our knowledge of the quantum state of the universe. Suppose the universal quantum state is a typical unit vector in a high-dimensional subspace $\mathscr{H}_0$ of Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, such as the low-entropy subspace defined by the Past Hypothesis. We show that: (1) Any particular observation is incapable of identifying the universal state vector in $\mathscr{H}_0$ or substantially reducing the set of possibilities. In other words, the overwhelming majority of possible state vectors are observationally indistinguishable from each other. (2) For any reasonably probable measurement outcome and for most pairs of vectors in $\mathscr{H}_0$, that outcome will not appreciably favor one vector over the other. (3) Bayesian updating on any measurement result, unless it is extraordinarily improbable, has a negligible effect on the initial uniform probability distribution over the states in $\mathscr{H}_0$. These findings represent the most stringent epistemic constraints known for a quantum universe and are derived from a typicality theorem in quantum statistical mechanics. We close by considering how theoretical considerations beyond empirical evidence might inform our understanding of this fact and our knowledge of the universal quantum state.</p>

            <p>We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schrödinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael et al. [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75-91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode - an explicitly open quantum system - are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</p>

Unlike previous approaches, our formulation applies universally to both bosonic and fermionic setups, and remains valid even in the presence of initial system-environment correlations, allowing for the exact computation of the system's reduced density matrix across all parameter regimes. Remarkably, the GME shares the same operatorial structure as the Redfield equation and depends on a single kernel - a dressed environment correlation function accounting for all virtual interactions between the system and the environment. This simple structure grants a clear physical interpretation and makes the GME easy to simulate numerically, as we show by applying it to an open system based on two fermions coupled via superconductive pairing.</p>

These findings advance our understanding of quantum correlations in ferrimagnetic materials.

            <p>Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime are a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated coherent interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of $21~\mathrm{\mu K}$ and read out with 77% single-shot fidelity. During the $6~\mathrm{ms}$ lifetime of the membrane the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective qubit detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the position noise spectrum of the membrane, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at $10~\mathrm{mK}$ and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Diósi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</p>

Owing to the subtle categorical nature of anyons, a global symmetry acting on them is generally realized in a projective manner. Symmetry fractionalization encodes this projective realization. The obstruction to defining symmetry fractionalization is captured by a cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose nontriviality signals a failure to define symmetry fractionalization consistently.

            <h2>Effective Free Energy Landscapes and Black Hole Thermodynamic Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Choon-Lin Ho</p>
            <p>A recent interesting development in the dynamics of black hole phase transitions has been the so-called Gibbs free energy landscape approach. In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a canonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon radius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is defined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius treated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond to the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free energy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an associated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which is independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the Fokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by considering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale with black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can be used to study the modification of the thermodynamic phase transition of a black hole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes under a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy become extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some theoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing functions of the horizon radius are considered. It is found that stronger noise disfavors the formation of black hole</p>

Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow.

However, such a computation requires an exponential amount of resources. This is a defining feature of quantum systems, the infamous ``curse of dimensionality'' . Other measures, which are based on Rényi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures. In this work, we concentrate on the maximal Rényi divergence. This measure can be shown to be the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. To calculate it efficiently for a 1D state represented as a matrix product state, we develop a generalized eigenvalue version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We benchmark our method for the paradigmatic XXZ chain, and show that the maximal Rényi divergence may exhibit different trends than the von Neumann mutual information.</p>

            <h2>A Polarization Hall Effect in Hydrated DNA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariusz Pietruszka</p>
            <p>Understanding how soft matter systems, including biological ones, can develop collective electromagnetic phenomena under external fields at ambient conditions remains a central challenge, as thermal fluctuations are generally expected to suppress long-range organization. Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold, followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton - proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse phenomena in hydrogen-bonded media.</p>

            <h2>Direct temperature readout in nonequilibrium quantum thermometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Xie, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum thermometry aims to measure temperature in nanoscale quantum systems, paralleling classical thermometry. However, temperature is not a quantum observable, and most theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on analyzing fundamental precision limits set by the quantum Fisher information through the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions. We validate the corrected dynamical temperature in a qubit-based thermometer under a range of nonequilibrium initial states, confirming its capability to estimate the true temperature. Importantly, we find that increasing quantum coherence can enhance the precision of this readout.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear quantum Kibble-Zurek ramps in open systems at finite temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes N. Kriel, Emma C. King, Michael Kastner</p>
            <p>We analyze quantum systems under a broad class of protocols in which the temperature and a Hamiltonian control parameter are ramped simultaneously and, in general, in a nonlinear fashion toward a quantum critical point. Using an open-system version of a Kitaev quantum wire as an example, we show that, unlike finite-temperature protocols at fixed temperature, these protocols allow us to probe, in an out-of-equilibrium situation and at finite temperature, the universality class (characterized by the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$) of an equilibrium quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations.</p>

            <h2>Lévy walkers inside spherical shells with absorbing boundaries: Towards settling the optimal Lévy walk strategy for random searches</h2>

            <p>The Lévy flight foraging hypothesis states that organisms must have evolved adaptations to exploit Lévy walk search strategies. Indeed, it is widely accepted that inverse square Lévy walks optimize the search efficiency in foraging with unrestricted revisits (also known as non-destructive foraging). However, a mathematically rigorous demonstration of this for dimensions $D \geq 2$ is still lacking. Here we study the very closely related problem of a Lévy walker inside annuli or spherical shells with absorbing boundaries. In the limit that corresponds to the foraging with unrestricted revisits, we show that inverse square Lévy walks optimize the search. This constitutes the strongest formal result to date supporting the optimality of inverse square Lévy walks search strategies.</p>

            <h2>Lambert W Function Framework for Graphene Nanoribbon Quantum Sensing: Theory, Verification, and Multi-Modal Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. A. Chishtie, K. Roberts, N. Jisrawi, S. R. Valluri, A. Soni, P. C. Deshmukh</p>
            <p>We establish a rigorous mathematical framework connecting graphene nanoribbon quantum sensing to the Lambert W function through the finite square well (FSW) analogy. The Lambert W function, defined as the inverse of $f(W) = We^W$, provides exact analytical solutions to transcendental equations governing quantum confinement. We demonstrate that operating near the branch point at $z = -1/e$ yields sensitivity enhancement factors scaling as $\eta_{\text{enh}} \propto (z - z_c)^{-1/2}$, achieving 35-fold enhancement at $\delta = 0.001$. Comprehensive numerical verification confirms: (i) all seven bound states for strength parameter $R = 10$ satisfying the constraint $u^2 + v^2 = R^2$; (ii) exact agreement between theoretical band gap formula $E_g = 2\pi\hbar v_F/(3L)$ and empirical relation $E_g = 1.38/L$ eV$\cdot$nm; (iii) universal sensitivity scaling across biomedical (SARS-CoV-2, inflammatory markers, cancer biomarkers), environmental (CO$_2$, CH$_4$, NO$_2$, N$_2$O, H$_2$O), and physical (strain, magnetic field, temperature) sensing modalities. This unified framework provides design principles for next-generation graphene quantum sensors with analytically predictable performance.</p>
