            <h2>Controlled pairing symmetries in a Fermi-Hubbard ladder with band flattening</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. P. Mendonça, S. Biswas, M. Dziurawiec, U. Bhattacharya, K. Jachymski, M. Aidelsburger, M. Lewenstein, M. M. Maśka, T. Grass</p>
            <p>Band flattening has been identified as key ingredient to correlation phenomena in Moiré materials and beyond. Here, we examine strongly repulsive fermions on a ladder -- a minimal platform for unconventional $d$-wave pairing -- and show that flattening of the lower band through an additional diagonal hopping term produces non-Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by the violation of Luttinger's theorem, as well as axial $d$-wave pairing correlations. Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry. Hence, our finding showcases a competition of different unconventional pairing channels, and demonstrates via a simple model how band geometry can induce fermionic pairing. This offers broadly relevant insights for correlated flat-band systems, ranging from ultracold atoms to strongly interacting electrons in solids.</p>

            <h2>Simulating fermionic fractional Chern insulators with infinite projected entangled-pair states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Chen, Titus Neupert, Juraj Hasik</p>
            <p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Long coherence silicon spin qubit fabricated in a 300 mm industrial foundry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Petar Tomić, Patrick Bütler, Yuze Wu, Bart Raes, Clement Godfrin, Stefan Kubicek, Julien Jussot, Yann Canvel, Yannick Hermans, Yosuke Shimura, Roger Loo, Sofie Beyne, Gulzat Jaliel, Thomas Van Caekenberghe, Vukan Levajac, Danny Wan, Kristiaan De Greve, Wister Wei Huang, Klaus Ensslin, Thomas Ihn</p>
            <p>Silicon spin qubits offer long coherence times, a compact footprint and compatibility with industrial CMOS manufacturing. Here, we investigate spin qubits hosted in quantum dots fabricated in a state-of-the-art 300 mm nanoelectronics foundry and demonstrate substantially enhanced coherence, achieving a Hahn-echo time of $T_2^{\text{Hahn}} = 4\,\mathrm{ms}$ for singlet--triplet oscillations. Employing noise spectroscopy and noise correlation measurements, we identify detuning noise with an amplitude of $\delta \varepsilon_{\mathrm{rms}} = 2.2\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ (integrated over 90 s) and observe strong zero-phase correlations between two spatially separated spin qubits. The singlet--triplet basis intrinsically rejects these common-mode fluctuations, yielding a pronounced suppression of dephasing. Our results suggest that exploiting the versatility of silicon quantum dots to adapt the qubit encoding to the microscopic noise landscape represents a promising strategy for advancing scalable quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Bias, length, or coupling? What controls the quantum efficiency of electroluminescent single-polymers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Facundo Tarasi, Esteban D. Gadea, Tchavdar Todorov, Damian A. Scherlis</p>
            <p>Since the first evidence of luminescence of organic polymers in STM junctions, efforts have been invested in elucidating how to leverage the voltage, anchoring chemistry, and molecular structure to optimize emission power and efficiency. Understanding the fundamentals underlying current-driven molecular emission is important not only for OLED engineering, but also to control luminescence at the atomic scale toward the mastering of single or localized photon sources. However, the difficulty in isolating the separate roles of the variables at play in molecular junction experiments, has precluded a general comprehension of their distinctive effects on the emitted power and the quantum yield. In the present report, we use time-dependent electronic structure simulations based on quantum electrodynamics to disentangle the incidence of bias, electronic coupling and molecular length on device performance, with polyphenylene-vinylene as a case study. A careful validation demonstrates that our approach can achieve quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Through its application we identify the applied bias as the main factor determining emission power. The quantum efficiency, however, is influenced only minimally by bias and electronic coupling, and is instead dominated by polymer length, on which it depends exponentially. Thus, using longer polymer chains emerges as the primary strategy for achieving higher efficiencies. Our results thereby provide key prescriptions for designing single-molecule electroluminescent platforms.</p>

            <h2>Spin and Orbital Angular Momentum Polarization in Thouless Topological Charge Pumping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Esmaeil Taghizadeh Sisakht, Uiseok Jeong, Xiao jiang, Jinseok Oh, Yizhou Liu, Binghai Yan, Noejung Park</p>
            <p>Quantized charge pumping in one-dimensional chiral wires has been widely studied in the context of topological physics in a (1+1)-dimensional synthetic space, yet the role of orbital and spin degrees of freedom in such topological pumps remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for Clean d-wave Superconductivity in Samarium Nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingming Huang, Xiaofang Fu, Junlong Wu, Laifeng Li, Liang Qiao, Ye Yang</p>
            <p>The discovery of superconducting nickelates provides a unique opportunity to explore the pairing mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we use ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy to probe the temperature-dependent superfluid density in an infinite-layer samarium nickelate film with a Tc of 20 K. The superfluid density decreases linearly with rising temperature, consistent with clean limit d-wave pairing. From this linear relation, we extract a superconducting gap of 2.5 meV and a gap-to-Tc ratio of 3, suggesting that this sample lies in the weak-coupling limit. Furthermore, the ratio of the mean free path to the coherence length, is determined to be 1.5, confirming the clean-limit behavior. These findings establish strong parallels between the pairing mechanisms in nickelate and cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Ab initio Approach to Collective Excitations in Excitonic Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fengyuan Xuan, Jiexi Song, Zhiyuan Sun</p>
            <p>An ab initio approach is presented for studying the collective excitations in excitonic insulators, charge/spin density waves and superconductors. We derive the Bethe-Salpeter-Equation for the particle-hole excitations in the quasiparticle representation, from which the collective excited states are solved and the corresponding order parameter fluctuations are computed. This method is demonstrated numerically for the excitonic insulating phases of the biased WSe2-MoSe2 bilayer. It reveals the gapless phase-mode, the subgap Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and the above-gap scattering states. Our work paves the way for quantitative predictions of excited state phenomena from first-principles calculations in electronic systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking.</p>

            <h2>Ferromagnetic interface engineering of spin-charge conversion in RuO$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongchao Yang, Zhaoqing Li, Yu Dai, Lili Lang, Zhong Shi, Zhe Yuan, Shi-Ming Zhou</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit torque efficiency is conventionally fixed by bulk materials. $D$-wave altermagnets introduce an additional nonrelativistic spin-charge conversion channel beyond inverse spin-Hall effect. Using prototypical candidate RuO$_2$ as an example, we show that the adjacent ferromagnet alone can dictate both the magnitude and sign of spin-charge conversion. Spin-pumping measurements on RuO$_2$/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) and RuO$_2$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) bilayers yield opposite effective spin-Hall angles that persist across crystalline and polycrystalline RuO$_2$. Inserting an ultrathin Au spacer at the RuO$_2$/YIG interface reverses the signal, envidencing a dominant interfacial inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect, whereas RuO$_2$/Py is governed by bulk inverse spin-Hall effect. First-principles calculations trace this dichotomy to interface-selective band hybridization: Rashba surface states survive at the insulating YIG contact yet are quenched by metallic Py. Our findings establish ferromagnetic interfacing as a deterministic knob for tailoring spin-charge conversion in altermagnetic oxides, paving the way to field-free, low-dissipation spintronic memory devices.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Tau Pulsed Illumination Differential Dynamic Microscopy with 80 $μ$s Resolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emmanuel Schaub, Martinus H. V. Werts</p>
            <p>Multi-Tau Pulsed Illumination Differential Dynamic Microscopy (MTPI-DDM) is introduced as a method for significantly enhancing the time resolution of DDM. The technique employs simple, low-cost instrumentation comprising a single monochrome digital camera and a single pulsed LED. A timing sequence, based on a geometric progression of time lags, is used to generate a "multi-tau" scheme, providing high sampling density at short timescales where dynamics are fastest. In the current implementation, a temporal resolution of 80 $\mu$s is achieved, limited by the dead time of the camera electronics. Validation of MTPI-DDM was performed by measuring the diffusion of 99 nm polystyrene nanoparticles in water. Compared to conventional continuous-wave (CW) DDM, the pulsed approach extends the range of the shortest measurable time lags by nearly two orders of magnitude and enhances DDM signal amplitudes by eliminating motion blur.</p>

            <h2>Observation of High-Order Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in a Cubic Ferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoran Chen, Yue Chen, Yizi Feng, Ruda Guo, Yuanfei Fan, Hongyue Xu, Tong Wu, Zhongxun Guo, Di Yue, Xiaofeng Jin, Yi Liu, Zhe Yuan, Yizheng Wu</p>
            <p>High-order anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) is observed up to the 18th harmonic in cubic Fe(001) thin films, overturning the long-standing paradigm that only two- and four-fold terms are symmetry-allowed. Using angle-resolved transport and Fourier analysis, we show that six-fold and higher-order terms are intrinsic, tunable by temperature and thickness, and predicted by crystal symmetry. Microscopically, the two-fold sign reversal arises from a crossover between weak and strong scattering regimes, while high-order terms emerge from the interplay of anisotropic Fermi velocity and relaxation time. Our results establish high-order AMR as a symmetry-prescribed property of cubic ferromagnets, providing critical benchmarks for spin-orbit transport theory and enabling new angular-sensitive spintronic functionalities.</p>

            <p>We consider a rhombohedral-stacked $N$-layer graphene coupled to a monolayer of Haldane model. We show that high order Dirac points in multilayer graphene can be gapped out by topological proximity effect of the Haldane model layer, leading to total Chern number $|C|=N+1$ quantum anomalous Hall states.

            <h2>Quantum Geometry Induced Kekulé Superconductivity in Haldane phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yafis Barlas, Fan Zhang, Enrico Rossi</p>
            <p>Chiral two-dimensional electron gases, which capture the electronic properties of graphene and rhombohedral graphene systems, exhibit singular momentum-space vortices and are susceptible to interaction-induced topological Haldane phases. Here, we investigate pairing interactions in these inversion-symmetric Haldane phases of chiral two-dimensional electron gases. We demonstrate that the nontrivial band topology of the Haldane phases enhances intra-valley (${\bf Q} = \pm 2 {\bf K_D}$) pair susceptibility relative to inter-valley (${\bf Q} = 0$) pair susceptibility, favoring the emergence of a lattice-scale pair-density wave order. When longitudinal acoustic phonons mediate the pairing interaction, the system supports a chiral Kekulè superconducting order. Our findings are relevant to superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene and Kagome metals.</p>

            <h2>Quantization of spin circular photogalvanic effect in altermagnetic Weyl semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroki Yoshida, Jan Priessnitz, Libor Šmejkal, Shuichi Murakami</p>
            <p>We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations. Our work unveils a distinctive optical response of altermagnets, paving the way for a new frontier in altermagnetism.</p>

            <h2>Correlated interlayer quantum Hall state in large-angle twisted trilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dohun Kim, Gyeoul Lee, Nicolas Leconte, Seyoung Jin, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Jeil Jung, Gil Young Cho, Youngwook Kim</p>
            <p>Trilayer graphene allows systematic control of its electronic structure through stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in alternating twisted trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5$^{\circ}$. The data reveal an electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent potential shifts. At charge neutrality ($\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$), three low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis attributes to emerging spin-resolved helical edge modes similar to those of quantum spin Hall insulators. At $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top layer remains inert at $\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic quantum Hall state. These results demonstrate correlated interlayer quantum Hall phases in alternating twisted trilayer graphene, including spin-resolved edge transport and excitonic order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuntao Gu, Louis Hector Jr, Paolo Giusto, Matthew Titsworth, Alok Warey, Dnyanesh Rajpathak, Eser Atesoglu</p>
            <p>Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.</p>

            <h2>Micromagnet-free operation of electron spin qubits in Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ vertical double quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhikbrata Sarkar, Daniel Loss</p>
            <p>We study a vertical double quantum dot (DQD) in a Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$/Si double-well heterostructure for full electrical control of electron Loss-DiVincenzo (LD) spin qubits, using realistic device modeling and numerical simulations. Due to the emerging spin-orbit interaction in the DQD, as well as strain from the gate electrodes, small (percentage range) but finite $g$ tensor variations emerge. In addition, we find a large valley splitting, on the order of $E_v{\sim}250\,\mu$eV. As a result, multiple avenues for fast electrical single qubit rotations emerge. An ac electric field gives rise to electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), while electron spin resonance (ESR) in the presence of an ac magnetic field can be electrically controlled by local gates due to varying $g$ factors in DQDs. We also show that shuttling between neighboring dots, in vertical and horizontal direction, results in ultrafast single qubit gates of less than a nanosecond. Remarkably, this DQD architecture completely eliminates the need for micromagnets, significantly facilitating the scalability of LD spin qubits in semiconductor foundries.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Enforced Topological Chiral Fermions in Amorphous Chiral Metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin Schirmann, Adolfo G. Grushin, Benjamin J. Wieder</p>
            <p>Since the prediction and observation of topological Weyl semimetals (chiral TSMs), there have been enormous efforts to characterize further condensed matter realizations of chiral fermions. These efforts were dramatically accelerated by the subsequent discovery of a profound link between low-energy topological and lattice chirality in structurally chiral crystals. Though TSMs are well understood in the limit of perfect translation symmetry, real solid-state materials host defects and disorder, and may even be rendered amorphous down to all but the smallest system length scales. Previous theoretical studies have concluded that chiral TSMs transition into trivial diffusive metals at moderate disorder scales, raising concerns that chiral TSM states may only be accessible in highly crystalline samples. In this work, we in contrast identify large families of chiral TSMs that persist under strong structural disorder - even into the amorphous regime. We show that amorphous chiral TSM phases can in particular be stabilized by the presence of long-range order in the local structural chirality. We present extensive analytic and numerical calculations demonstrating the existence of both Weyl and higher-charge chiral fermions in amorphous metals whose topology and spin and orbital angular momentum textures are tunable via the interplay of average symmetry and geometry. To distinguish and generate new realizations of strongly disordered chiral fermions, we introduce an analytic approach grounded in symmetry group theory. We then introduce an amorphous Wilson loop numerical method to characterize chiral fermions with quantized Berry curvature fluxes in metals with 3D structural disorder. Our findings bridge the crystalline and strongly disordered regimes of chiral TSMs, and indicate a clear route towards engineering geometry-enforced topology in non-crystalline materials and metamaterials.</p>

            <h2>All-to-All interactions via multifractal wavefunction geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> YouYoung Joung, Jemin Park, SungBin Lee</p>
            <p>We uncover a generic mechanism through which the intrinsic geometry of multifractal quantum wavefunctions generates effective all-to-all interactions in many-body systems. By analyzing the multifractal spectrum, we demonstrate that the simultaneous participation of widely separated length scales creates a global connectivity that bypasses local interaction constraints. This nonlocality leads to fast information scrambling, evidenced by sharp changes in the quenched dynamics of the quantum Fisher information and bipartite mutual information with the onset of negative tripartite mutual information. Such rapid scrambling is a defining feature of strongly chaotic quantum dynamics, and our results identify the systems with multifractal states as a promising solid-state platform for realizing this regime. More broadly, they reveal a new paradigm in which complex, multiscale wavefunction structure intrinsically generates long-range connectivity, providing a natural route to achieving nonlocal behavior in strongly correlated quantum materials.</p>

            <p>We identify an unconventional form of the non-Hermitian skin effect that occurs not in position space but in many-body Fock space, which we call the Fock space skin effect (FSSE). Using quantum dimer models, we characterize FSSE analytically and numerically, and propose a concrete route toward its realization in Rydberg atom arrays. The dimer constraint is enforced through Rydberg gadgets employing the blockade mechanism, while directional reservoirs generate non-Hermitian flipping amplitudes. We show that FSSE enables the preparation of gapped spin liquid states, and in particular, we demonstrate how a Rydberg geometry realizing a square lattice quantum dimer model with next-nearest neighbor dimers can be driven by non-Hermiticity into an exact spin liquid ground state. Our results establish Fock-space non-Hermiticity as a powerful principle for engineering exotic quantum phases and dynamical state-preparation protocols.</p>

            <p>Thanks to recent experimental advances in simulating and detecting quantum dynamics with high precision and controllability, our understanding of the physics of monitored quantum systems has considerably deepened over the past decades. In this article, we provide an introductory theoretical review on the basic formalisms governing open quantum dynamics under measurement, along with recent developments in their spectral and typical aspects. After reviewing quantum measurement theory, we introduce the concept of quantum trajectories, which are the conditional dynamics of monitored states shaped by a set of measurement outcomes. We then discuss the spectral properties of the dynamical map describing the evolution averaged over measurement outcomes. As has recently been recognized, these spectral features are intimately connected to whether quantum trajectories exhibit typical behaviors, such as the ergodicity and purification. Moreover, we introduce Lyapunov exponents of typical quantum trajectories and discuss how these quantities serve as indicators of measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the intrinsic (impurity-independent) spin Nernst effect (SNE), a spin current generation perpendicular to temperature gradients, in spin-triplet superconductors. We show that, in these systems, the SNE consists of two distinct contributions: a direct quasiparticle contribution and an indirect supercurrent contribution. The quasiparticle contribution originates from the momentum space Berry curvature generated by spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The indirect contribution arises from a compensating supercurrent that cancels the bulk thermoelectric charge current. While this contribution vanishes when the condensate has no spin-polarization in momentum space, it can be comparable in magnitude to the quasiparticle contribution in nonunitary superconductors. These results demonstrate that thermoelectric spin supercurrent must be explicitly accounted for when evaluating the SNE in nonunitary superconductors.</p>

            <p>We introduce a class of superconductors termed "quantized quadrupole superconductors" that support Majorana corner modes according to the bulk-corner correspondence, distinct from previous works on the second-order topological superconductors. An intrinsic physical quantity for superconductors, i.e., the quadrupole moment serves as the topological invariant, which is always half-quantized due to the particle-hole symmetry. As examples, two types of mixed pairings, $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm id_{xy}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm is$, induced in the bilayer two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling give the quadrupole phase. Extended discussions indicate that the nontrivial phase is robust against relative phase fluctuations in the mixed pairings and the disorders.

            <h2>Altermagnetism Induced Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces Form Topological Superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Fu, Chang-An Li, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>We propose a novel type of topological superconductivity based on Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in an altermagnetic topological insulator proximitized by an s-wave superconductor. The 3D altermagnetic topological insulator is characterized by zero-energy surface states in bulk nodal-ring phases and anisotropically shifted surface Dirac cones in topological insulating phases. It is potentially realized in \mathrm{EuIn_{2}As_{2}}. The altermagnetic order in combination with superconductivity gives rise to highly anisotropic superconducting gaps with crystal-facet-dependent BFSs at the physical boundaries. These particular BFSs provide distinct platforms to realize Majorana zero modes (MZMs). We propose a quasi-1D nanowire in which the anisotropic BFSs experience topological phase transitions due to quantum confinement leading to MZMs at its ends. We further consider vortex phase transitions in the superconducting altermagnetic topological insulators. Remarkably, we find that the altermagnetic order allows us to transit between two distinct type of MZMs, one type is located at the vortex line, while the other type is located at the physical boundaries. Our work paves a new avenue utilizing altermagnetism-induced BFSs to engineer topological superconductivity through crystal anisotropy and quantum confinement.</p>

            <h2>Ultrahigh Charge-to-Spin Conversion and Tunneling Magnetoresistance in Quasi-Two-Dimensional d-wave Altermagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing Zhang, Siyun Wang, Jianting Dong, Jia Zhang</p>
            <p>The emergence of altermagnets has driven groundbreaking advances in spintronics. Notably, d-wave altermagnets support non-relativistic spin transport, efficient charge-to-spin conversion, and T-odd spin currents. In addition, their integration as electrodes in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) enables a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, allowing electrical detection of Néel vectors for next-generation memory devices. In this work, we investigate the non-relativistic spin transport properties of the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) d-wave altermagnet KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O and the TMR effect in KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs via first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O exhibits a non-relativistic longitudinal spin polarization and a spin Hall angle both exceeding 60\% at room temperature, while KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs achieve a giant TMR reaching approximately $10^{12}$\%, which remains robust against Fermi level shifts. These findings highlight the anisotropic spin polarization inherent to d-wave staggered magnetism and underscore the critical role of Fermi surface topology in enhancing T-odd spin transport and the TMR effect in AFMTJs.</p>

            <h2>Surface Exciton Polaritons and Near-Zero Permittivity Surface Waves Supported by Artificial Organic Hyperbolic Metamaterials</h2>

De Beule, Eduardo Solano, Rosalia Serna, Mikhail Vasilevskiy, Martin Lopez-Garcia, Isabel Pastoriza-Santos, Sara Núñez-Sánchez</p>
            <p>Hyperbolic metamaterials enable extreme light confinement and control of photonic states, but their realization has been restricted to inorganic architectures. Here, a fully organic route to fabricate artificial hyperbolic metamaterials based on multilayered thin films of J-aggregate carbocyanine dyes alternated with polyelectrolytes is introduced. These structures exhibit strong optical anisotropy and experimentally support hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons and, for selected dyes, additional surface waves in near-zero permittivity regimes. Spectroscopic ellipsometry confirms a uniaxial dielectric tensor with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane components, close to the absorption peaks of the constituent J-aggregates. This anisotropy is preserved across individual layers, demonstrating the robustness of the layer-by-layer approach and enabling the coupling of surface exciton polaritons and near-zero permittivity modes even in films only a few nanometres thick. Transfer-matrix simulations based on the obtained dielectric tensor reproduce the coupling conditions for all thicknesses, validating the optical model. Structural characterization reveals the link between optical anisotropy and supramolecular order, with preferential in-plane molecular orientation and the evolution from discrete nanostructures to continuous films as deposition progresses. These organic hyperbolic metamaterial architectures, associated with narrow excitonic resonances from J-aggregates, offer a unique platform for tailoring emission, energy transport, and exploring polariton dynamics at the nanoscale.</p>

            <h2>Opening a gap in the collective excitation modes of a driven-dissipative condensate in the presence of an external coherent drive</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Stazzu, G. A. P. Sacchetto, I. Carusotto</p>
            <p>We build a minimal theoretical model to describe the opening of a gap in the dispersion of the collective excitations of a driven-dissipative condensate when the condensate phase is fixed by an additional coherent phase-locking drive. We map out the phase diagram as a function of the frequency and the strength of the coherent drive. We identify regions where the gap is purely imaginary or has a finite real part. When the coherent drive is unable to lock the condensate phase, a gapless Goldstone mode is recovered in the Floquet-Bogoliubov dispersion of collective modes. We finally characterize regions of finite-wavevector dynamical instability, where the condensate tends to develop a supersolid-like spatial modulation. While our theoretical framework is directly related to recent experiments with exciton-polariton condensates, it can be applied to describe the effect of external injection also in a variety of spatially extended optical parametric oscillators or laser devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations on the suppression of superconducting order in two-dimensional systems. Within the two-dimensional quantum XY model in the phase representation, where on-site interaction terms govern quantum phase fluctuations, we perform extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting temperature-interaction phase diagram establishes the presence of a well-defined critical line ending at a quantum critical point at vanishing temperature with no indication of reentrant behavior. We further demonstrate that the resistance above the critical line reproduces the two expected different critical behaviors. For stronger interactions, above the quantum critical point, the system exhibits a crossover to an insulating regime at low temperatures. Finally, Monte Carlo calculations of current-current correlation functions enable us to extract the frequency-dependent conductivity in both superconducting and normal regimes, revealing a finite-frequency response that we attribute to quantum phase fluctuations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donggang Cao, Sankha Shuvra Das, Gilad Yossifon</p>
            <p>Controlled assembly of active-passive colloidal mixtures offers a route to reconfigurable microscale machines, but their self-assembly pathways remain poorly understood. We study the directed assembly of metallo-dielectric Janus particles (JPs) and passive polystyrene (PS) beads using optoelectrically reconfigurable AC-field patterning, which allows precise control over particle composition and binding sequence. Through experiments, analytical modeling, and simulations, we show that dipolar interactions drive robust JP-JP and JP-PS dimer formation with frequency-dependent stability. At intermediate and high frequencies, JP-PS binding is strongly attractive, whereas at low frequencies it becomes effectively repulsive due to electrical double-layer screening and electrohydrodynamic flows at the metallic hemisphere. In multi-particle systems, PS beads act as cooperative hubs that hierarchically recruit JPs, yielding higher-order hybrid structures. We identify structural isomers - for example, 3JP + 1PS clusters can form chain-like or triangular configurations depending on assembly sequence. Simulations confirm both as equilibrium states, with the triangular isomer slightly more stable. Similar polymorphism appears in larger clusters (4JPs). Overall, we establish a framework for controlled active-passive colloidal assembly, showing how frequency-tunable interactions and structural polymorphism enable the design of reconfigurable colloidal machines for applications in microrobotics, targeted delivery, and adaptive materials.</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices in van der Waals materials have revolutionized the study of electronic and excitonic systems by creating periodic electrostatic potentials. Extending this concept to magnetic materials promises new pathways in merging spintronics with photonics. While moiré magnetism has been revealed with near-field probes and nonlinear optical techniques, the coupling of these magnetic textures to optical excitations - magneto-moiré excitons - remains unexplored. Here, we report the observation of magneto-moiré excitons in twisted bilayer CrSBr, correlated with moiré spin textures that emerge below a critical twist angle of ~2°. The nanoscale moiré spin texture imprints distinct signatures onto the optical spectrum, shifting the exciton energy via a periodic magnetic exchange field. First-principles calculations corroborate that these signatures arise from one-dimensional spin textures governed by the balance of exchange interactions and domain wall energy. Our results demonstrate that moiré magnetism can be used to engineer nanoscale excitonic energy landscapes, providing a new platform for magneto-optical sensing, quantum transduction, and control of non-collinear magnetism and topology through light.</p>

            <p>Layered magnetic and strongly correlated materials present a rich platform for condensed matter physics with intrinsic properties intertwined by magnetism and low-dimensionality. A suspended light-emitting 2D antiferromagnetic membrane forms a highly controllable hybrid system in which the interplay between spin ordering, optical and mechanical degrees of freedom can be uniquely explored. NiPS$_3$ hosts excitons responsible for a puzzling luminescence down to a few atomic layers, linked to its zigzag antiferromagnetic order. The nature of these excitons remains unclear. Here we report on the magnetic excitons of a suspended few-layer NiPS$_3$ membrane. We reveal nematic zigzag states and study the optical transitions induced by the magnon-mediated motion of the excitation in the magnetic lattice, resulting in magnon-dressed excitons. We observe a strain tuning of these emission lines, dependent on their microscopic origin, with rates that sign a strong localization of the magnetic excitons, fading with the number of magnon-mediated hops.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Christian Ohnmacht, Wolfgang Belzig, Juan Carlos Cuevas</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the charge value of transport mechanisms heavily impacts the validity of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). Specifically, we show within the framework of full counting statistics, that the recently established quantum TUR can be violated by the presence of transport processes that carry more than one charge, like Andreev reflection processes in normal metal-superconductor junctions. We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism.</p>

            <p>We develop theoretical methods to predict the effects of paramagnetic impurities on the microwave response of conventional spin-singlet superconductors. Our focus is on superconducting devices and resonators with low concentrations of impurities and exchange interactions with conduction electrons. We connect the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum generated by pair-breaking to the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity for superconductors operating at microwave frequencies. We report theoretical results for superconducting device performance -- dissipation, quality factor and frequency shift anomalies -- based on self-consistent calculations of the current response and penetraion of the electromagnetic field at the vacuum-superconducting interface. Key results include the prediction of a non-monotonic anomaly in the low-frequency superfluid fraction and penetration depth at very low temperatures related to the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum. Dissipation of microwave power is predicted from intra- and inter- impurity band transitions at GHz frequencies at low temperatures, including a physical mechanism responsible for residual resistance. We predict anomalies in the resonant frequency, $f(T)$, and quality factor, $Q(T)$, of high-Q SRF cavities operating in the GHz range at low-temperatures that are sensitive to non-magnetic and paramagnetic impurity disorder.</p>

The main focus of this experiment is to enable the investigation of the properties of all six hydrogen isotopologues and their mixtures in the gaseous, liquid, and solid phase, as well as the dynamics of their phase changes. In addition, mixtures with noble gases such as xenon and neon can be investigated.

            <h2>Learning transitions of topological surface codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Finn Eckstein, Bo Han, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>For the surface code, topological quantum order allows one to encode logical quantum information in a robust, long-range entangled many-body quantum state. However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana "metal" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a "metal to insulator" transition...</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body scars break ergodicity and evade thermalization, resulting in area law entanglement entropy even with high energy density. While their quantum correlations and entanglement have been elaborated previously, their capacity in storing extractable energy, quantified by the notion ergotropy, remains an open question. Here we focus on the representative PXP model, and unveil the extensive ergotropy scaling of a family of states interpolating between quantum many-body scars and thermal states, the latter of which are known to be passive with vanishing ergotropy. A phenomenological relation between ergotropy and entanglement is uncovered, which generalizes the existing free fermion integrable results to an interacting scenario. The ergotropy in a dynamical protocol shows that a reset with a global uniform coherent rotation can inject extractable energy, as a proof of principle way to charge a quantum "battery". Our protocol is tailored for near term Rydberg neutral atoms array, while also being feasible for other quantum processors. Our results establish that quantum many-body scars, despite the tiny fraction of the Hilbert space they occupy, can be efficiently exploited for storing extractable energy, and "scarring" a many-body system as a promising route for engineering quantum many-body battery.</p>

Numerically, we find pronounced differences in the dynamical spreading of OTOCs between nearest-neighbor and power-law interacting systems. This deviation persists even for short-range interactions, opposing the common view that these interactions produce dynamics equivalent to the nearest-neighbor case. In a detailed experimental proposal, tailored but not limited to Rydberg tweezer setups, we present a protocol to extract OTOCs in XXZ Heisenberg spin systems with tunable anisotropy and programmable disorder based on currently available techniques.</p>

            <p>Out-of-Time-Ordered Commutators (OTOCs), representing a key diagnostic for scrambling as a facet of short-time quantum chaos, have attracted wide-ranging interest, from many-body physics to quantum gravity. By means of a suitable form of the Wigner-Moyal expansion, and invoking ensemble equivalence in statistical physics, we provide a consistent approach to the growth rate of the OTOC for many-body systems with chaotic classical limit where both the classical Lyapunov exponent and the quantum nature of the density of states enter. Applying this construction to quantized high-dimensional hyperbolic motion, i.e., a quantum chaotic system that exhibits gravity-like correlation functions in the late-time regime, we compute the OTOC growth rate $\Lambda$ as a function of the number of degrees of freedom, $f$, and inverse temperature, $\beta$. We show that the scaled growth rate, $\Lambda/f$, can be described by a universal function of $f \beta$ and displays a cross-over from classical to quantum behavior as we increase $f$ and/or lower the temperature. In the deep quantum regime of infinite $f$, we find maximally fast scrambling in the sense of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. This elucidates the non-perturbative mechanism underlying the saturation of the bound via quantum contributions to the mean density of states, and it provides further support for this dynamical system as a dual to two-dimensional quantum gravity. In this way, we present first evidence of maximally fast scrambling in a quantum chaotic system with a well-defined classical Hamiltonian limit, without invoking any external mechanism such as (disorder) averaging.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Tensor in the Wild: Resolving Stokes Phenomena via Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prasoon Saurabh</p>
            <p>Standard topological invariants, such as the Chern number and Berry phase, form the bedrock of modern quantum matter classification. However, we demonstrate that this framework undergoes a \textbf{catastrophic failure} in the presence of essential singularities -- ubiquitous in open, driven, and non-Hermitian systems ("Wild" regime). In these settings, the local geometric tensor diverges, rendering standard invariants ill-defined and causing perturbative predictions to deviate from reality by order unity ($\sim 100\%$). We resolve this crisis by introducing the \textbf{Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy (FMS)} protocol, a pulse-level control sequence, which experimentally extracts the hidden \textit{Stokes Phenomenon} -- the "missing" geometric data that completes the topological description. By mapping the singularity's Stokes multipliers to time-domain observables, FMS provides a rigorous experimental bridge to \textbf{Resurgence Theory}, allowing for the exact reconstruction of non-perturbative physics from divergent asymptotic series. We validate this framework on a superconducting qudit model, demonstrating that the "Stokes Invariant" serves as the next-generation quantum number for classifying phases of matter beyond the reach of conventional topology.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian physics has unlocked a wealth of unconventional wave phenomena beyond the reach of Hermitian systems, with exceptional points (EPs) driving enhanced sensitivity, nonreciprocal transport, and topological behavior unique to non-Hermitian degeneracies. Here, we present a scalable and reconfigurable silicon photonic integrated circuit capable of emulating arbitrary non-Hermitian time evolution with high precision. Using this programmable platform, we implement a two-band non-Hermitian Hamiltonian defined on a Klein-bottle topology a nonorientable parameter space that enables exceptional phases forbidden on orientable manifolds. Through an on-chip amplitude-and-phase reconstruction protocol, we retrieve the full complex Hamiltonian at multiple points in parameter space and experimentally map the associated Fermi arc where the imaginary eigenvalue gap closes. The orientation of the measured Fermi arc reveals a nontrivial exceptional topology: it implies the presence of same-charge EPs (or an EP monopole) that cannot annihilate locally on the Klein bottle. Our results demonstrate the first photonic realization of exceptional topology on a nonorientable manifold and establish a versatile platform for exploring exotic non-Hermitian and topological models relevant to classical and quantum photonics.</p>

            <p>Thermodynamic inference from coarse observations remains a key challenge. Memory, in particular correlations between consecutively observed mesostates, blur signatures of irreversibility and must be accounted for in defining physical time-reversal, which remains an open problem. We derive an experimentally accessible k-th order estimator for the entropy production rate. Using novel measure-theoretic techniques we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for guaranteed lower bounds on the dissipation even in the strongly non-Markovian setting. The proof reveals that estimators saturated in the order unravel the duration of memory which needs to be considered in defining physically consistent time-reversal. We show that Markovian estimators in absence of a time-scale separation lead to artifacts, which convey no physical meaning. Similarly, estimators not saturated in the order may overestimate the dissipation. The necessity of correctly accounting for memory in thermodynamic inference from strongly non-Markovian observations underscores the still underappreciated challenges and intricacies in defining and understanding irreversibility in presence of memory. Our results will hopefully stimulate experiments systematically considering thermodynamic inference on multiple scales consistently accounting for memory.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals magnets are an emergent material class of paramount interest for fundamental studies in coupling light with matter excitations, which are uniquely linked to their underlying magnetic properties. Among these materials, the semiconducting magnet CrSBr is possibly a first playground where we can study simultaneously the interaction of photons, magnons, and excitons at the quantum level. Here we demonstrate a coherent macroscopic quantum phase, the bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons, emerging in a CrSBr flake embedded in a fully tunable cryogenic open optical cavity. The Bose condensate is characterized by a highly non-linear threshold-like behavior, and coherence manifests distinctly via its first and second order quantum correlations. We find that the condensate's non-linearity is highly susceptible to the magnetic order in CrSBr. Specially, it can encounter a sign change from attractive to repulsive interactions when the intrinsic antiferromagnetic order transforms to the forced ferromagnetic order. Our findings open a route towards magnetically controllable quantum fluids of light, and optomagnonic devices where spin magnetism is coupled to on-chip Bose-Einstein condensates.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of random pinned disorder on a collection of self propelled particles. To achieve this, we construct a continuum model by formulating the coupled hydrodynamic equations for slow variables, local density and momentum density of particles. The disorder in the system acts as pinning sites, effectively immobilizing the particles that come into contact with them. Our numerical results reveal that weak disorder leads to phase separation in the system at density and activity lower than the typical values for motility induced phase separation. We construct a phase diagram using numerical simulations as well as linearized approximation in the plane of activity and packing fraction of particles at weak disorder densities. On increasing disorder density the system shows the Micro phase separation, while at large disorder densities, the system becomes heterogeneous and eventually undergoes kinetic arrest. The structure factor tail deviates from the Porods law, indicating increased roughness at domain interfaces under strong disorder. Furthermore, we analyze the fractal dimension of the interface as a function of disorder density, highlighting the increasing irregularity of phase separated domains. We also found that disorder significantly suppresses number fluctuations in the system.</p>

            <p>An acoustic standing wave acts as a lattice of evenly spaced potential energy wells for sub-wavelength-scale objects. Trapped particles interact with each other by exchanging waves that they scatter from the standing wave. Unless the particles have identical scattering properties, their wave-mediated interactions are nonreciprocal. Pairs of particles can use this nonreciprocity to harvest energy from the wave to sustain steady-state oscillations despite viscous drag and the absence of periodic driving. We show in theory and experiment that a minimal system composed of two acoustically levitated particles can access four distinct dynamical states, two of which are emergently active steady states. Under some circumstances, these emergently active steady states break spatiotemporal symmetry and therefore constitute a classical time crystal.</p>

To model these effects on the hydrodynamic fields, we assume that the quantum fields are coupled to an additive, delta-correlated (in space and time) quantum noise field. Thus, the hydrodynamic fields are defined in a fluctuating environment. After defining the generating functional of connected correlation functions in the presence of the noise field, we perform a functional integral over all noise field configurations. This is done using a formal object inspired by the distributional zeta-function method, called the configurational zeta-function. We obtain a new generating functional written in terms of an analytically tractable functional series. This formalism allow us to obtain the excitation spectra of liquids. In the liquid, each term of the series describes the emergent non-interacting elementary excitations with the usual phonon-like dispersion relation and additional excitations with dispersion relations with gaps in pseudo-momentum space. Finally, the behavior of the constant volume specific heat as a function of temperature is obtained for different simple liquids.</p>

            <h2>Bridging constrained random-phase approximation and linear response theory for computing Hubbard parameters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Carta, Iurii Timrov, Sophie Beck, Claude Ederer</p>
            <p>The predictive accuracy of popular extensions to density-functional theory (DFT) such as DFT+U and DFT plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) hinges on using realistic values for the screened Coulomb interaction U. Here, we present a systematic comparison of the two most widely used approaches to compute this parameter, i.e. linear response theory (LRT) and the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA), using a unified framework based on the use of maximally localized Wannier functions. We show that the U in LRT and cRPA can differ as much as 30%. We demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from two main differences: neglecting the response of the exchange-correlation potential in cRPA and additional excitation channels in LRT. By taking these differences into account, we can achieve near perfect agreement between the two techniques. Moreover, we show that in cases with strong hybridization between interacting and screening subspaces, the application of cRPA becomes ambiguous and can lead to unrealistically small U values, while LRT remains well-behaved. Our work formally connects both methods, sheds light on their strengths and limitations, and emphasizes the importance of using a consistent set of Wannier orbitals to ensure transferability of U values between different implementations.</p>

            <h2>Pressure induced evolution of anisotropic superconductivity and Fermi surface nesting in a ternary boride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhajit Pramanick, Sudip Chakraborty, A. Taraphder</p>
            <p>Using Migdal-Eliashberg theory implemented in Electron Phonon Wannier (EPW) code, we have investigated anisotropic superconductivity in a ternary boride $\mathrm{Ta(MoB)_2}$. It is a single-gap, anisotropic, phonon-mediated superconductor having a critical temperature $\mathrm{T_c}\sim \, 19.3$ K. A dominant contribution to superconductivity arises from the robust coupling between electronic states, primarily created by the $\mathrm{d_{xy}}$,$\mathrm{d_{x^2 - y^2}}$ orbitals of Mo atoms and the in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms. A weak Fermi surface nesting and a small electron-phonon coupling cannot induce charge density wave-like instabilities, as evidenced by the lack of a significant peak in the real part of the total Lindhard susceptibility and the absence of phonon softening. Furthermore, we have studied its electronic and superconducting properties under hydrostatic pressure up to 76.69 GPa, owing to its low bulk modulus and metastability. The persistent reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level, Fermi surface nesting and the stiffening of phonon modes lead to a diminution of superconductivity under pressure up to 59.71 GPa. At 76.69 GPa, a modification in the topology of the Fermi surface, namely a Lifshitz transition, occurs resulting in a sudden enhancement of nesting. This enhanced nesting, in turn, induces an abrupt stabilisation of superconductivity at 76.69 GPa, resulting in a V-shaped response to pressure.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion with stochastic resetting on a lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander K. Hartmann, Satya N. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We provide an exact formula for the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to a target at the origin for a single particle diffusing on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic {\em lattice} starting from a fixed initial position $\vec R_0$ and resetting to $\vec R_0$ with a rate $r$. Previously known results in the continuous space are recovered in the scaling limit $r\to 0$, $R_0=|\vec R_0|\to \infty$ with the product $\sqrt{r}\, R_0$ fixed. However, our formula is valid for any $r$ and any $\vec R_0$ that enables us to explore a much wider region of the parameter space that is inaccessible in the continuum limit. For example, we have shown that the MFPT, as a function of $r$ for fixed $\vec R_0$, diverges in the two opposite limits $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ with a unique minimum in between, provided the starting point is not a nearest neighbour of the target. In this case, the MFPT diverges as a power law $\sim r^{\phi}$ as $r\to \infty$, but very interestingly with an exponent $\phi= (|m_1|+|m_2|+\ldots +|m_d|)-1$ that depends on the starting point $\vec R_0= a\, (m_1,m_2,\ldots, m_d)$ where $a$ is the lattice spacing and $m_i$'s are integers. If, on the other hand, the starting point happens to be a nearest neighbour of the target, then the MFPT decreases monotonically with increasing $r$, approaching a universal limiting value $1$ as $r\to \infty$, indicating that the optimal resetting rate in this case is infinity. We provide a simple physical reason and a simple Markov-chain explanation behind this somewhat unexpected universal result. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations on lattices up to $50$ dimensions. Finally, in the absence of a target, we also compute exactly the position distribution of the walker in the nonequlibrium stationary state that also displays interesting lattice effects not captured by the continuum theory.</p>

            <h2>Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Huang, Seth Musser, Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported by F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble or Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, F. Xu et al. report that the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose and substantiate with analysis of the experimental data that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi-surface topology and a metallic phase with a non quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical and structural properties of an absorbing phase transition: a case study from granular systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Maire, Andrea Plati, Frank Smallenburg, Giuseppe Foffi</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamical and structural properties of absorbing phase transitions (APTs) within granular systems. Specifically, we examine a model for vibrofluidized systems of spherical grains, which undergo a transition from a state of purely vertical motion to one characterized by horizontal diffusion as the density increases. Numerical simulations reveal that, depending on the specific system parameters, both continuous and discontinuous transitions can occur, each associated with markedly distinct structural properties at the transition point. We explain this using a theoretical analysis based on kinetic theory applied to an effective 2D model, which elucidates the role of a synchronization effect in determining the nature of the transition. A fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, which quantitatively describes the structural and dynamical properties of the active state such as hyperuniformity is derived from the microscopic dynamics, together with an equilibrium-like assumption concerning the noises on the hydrodynamic fields. This work expands on previous studies by providing a comprehensive examination of the APT characteristics and proposing new theoretical models to interpret the observed behaviors.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional hybrid metal halide perovskites combine strong spin-orbit coupling, soft lattice dynamics and molecular tunability, making them promising platforms for chiral optoelectronics and spin dependent phenomena. While chiral organic spacers are known to induce optical activity, the microscopic mechanism by which molecular chirality couples to the inorganic lattice remains unclear. Here, we investigate coherent vibrational dynamics in the chiral perovskite ($R$-MBA)$_2$PbI$_4$ and its racemic analogue using transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by Raman spectroscopy and ab-initio calculations. We identify a coherent phonon at ~5.7 meV that couples strongly to excitons in the chiral material but is absent in the racemic counterpart. This mode is assigned to lattice vibrations involving coupled motion of the chiral spacer and Pb-I framework, including rotational displacement patterns. These results establish coherent lattice motion as a pathway for mediating chiral responses in hybrid materials.</p>

            <p>Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of complexity theory and find application in a plethora of prominent tasks ranging from cryptography to genetics. Classical approaches use Hopfield networks to find approximate solutions while recently, modern machine-learning techniques like graph neural networks have become popular for this task. In this study, we employ the known mapping of MAX-2-SAT, a class of CSPs, to a spin-glass system from statistical physics, and use Glauber dynamics to approximately find its ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the underlying problem. We show that Glauber dynamics outperforms the traditional Hopfield-network approach and can compete with state-of-the-art solvers. A systematic theoretical analysis uncovers the role of stochastic fluctuations in finding CSP solutions: even in the absence of thermal fluctuations at $T=0$ a significant portion of spins, which correspond to the CSP variables, attains an effective spin-dependent non-zero temperature. These spins form a subspace in which the stochastic Glauber dynamics continuously performs flips to eventually find better solutions. This is possible since the energy is degenerate, such that spin flips in this free-spin space do not require energy. Our theoretical analysis leads to deterministic solvers that effectively account for such fluctuations, thereby reaching state-of-the-art performance.</p>

            <h2>Exceptional Andreev spectrum and supercurrent in p-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-An Li, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>We investigate the spectrum of Andreev bound states and supercurrent in a $p$-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junction (NHJJ) in one dimension. The studied NHJJ is composed of two topological $p$-wave superconductors connected by a non-Hermitian dissipative junction. Starting from the effective non-Hermitian Bogoliubov-de Gennes bulk Hamiltonian, we find that a pair of exceptional points emerge in the complex spectrum of Andreev quasi-bound states. The two exceptional points with zero energy locate symmetrically with respect to Josephson phase difference $\phi=\pi$, at which a Majorana zero mode persists. Notably, the exceptional points descend from a pair of Majorana zero modes after turning on the non-Hermiticity and are topologically protected. By analyzing the non-Hermitian scattering process at the junction, we explicitly demonstrate the loss of quasiparticles through the decay of scattering amplitude probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain the supercurrent directly by the inelastic Andreev reflection amplitudes, which provides a more intuitive interpretation of transport properties in NHJJs. The supercurrent varies continuously as a function of $\phi$ across the exceptional points. No enhancement of critical current is observed. We also generalize our analysis to a mixed $s$-$p$ wave NHJJ. Our results provide new insights on transport properties of Josephson junctions in presence of Majorana zero modes, exceptional points, and non-Hermiticity.</p>

            <h2>Path-Integral Formulation of Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Monte Carlo stochastic trajectories using the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q Functions and Hybrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toma Yoneya, Kazuya Fujimoto, Yuki Kawaguchi</p>
            <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability, which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral, and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.</p>

Our analysis underscores the need to minimize metallic contact effects in thermal Hall measurements, which can be achieved by optimizing measurement configurations.</p>

            <p>Single-layer MnBr$_2$ is grown on graphene (Gr) supported by Ir(110) and investigated using low-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and spectroscopy. The structure and epitaxial relationship with the substrate are systematically characterized. The structure and epitaxial relationship with the substrate are systematically characterized. The growth morphology strongly depends on the growth temperature, evolving from fractal to dendritic and eventually to compact dendritic skeletal islands, reflecting changes in the underlying surface diffusion processes. The pronounced variation in the apparent height with tunneling conditions for the magnetic insulator is explained based on the measured electronic density of states. MnBr$_2$ on Gr/Ir(110) constitutes a three-lattice system, giving rise to a super-moiré pattern -- a moiré of moirés. The super-moiré of MnBr$_2$/Gr/Ir(110) is unique, as it involves a virtual moiré of MnBr$_2$ with the Ir(110) surface lattice -- two lattices not in contact with each other. Using a careful Fourier analysis, the known properties of Gr/Ir(110), and the results of ab initio calculations, the origin of the virtual moiré is uncovered and related to the inhomogeneous binding of Gr to Ir(110). Comparative experiments with MnBr$_2$ on Gr/Ir(111) show similar growth and structure, but highlight the unique properties of the MnBr$_2$/Gr/Ir(110) super-moiré.</p>

            <h2>The Thermodynamic Limit of Extreme First-Passage Times</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Talia Baravi, Eli Barkai</p>
            <p>The statistics of the slowest first-passage time among a large population of $N$ searchers is crucial for determining the completion time of many stochastic processes. Classical extreme-value theory predicts that for diffusing particles in a finite domain of size $L$, the slowest first passage time follows a Gumbel distribution, but a Fréchet distribution in an infinite domain. Here, we study the physically relevant thermodynamic limit where both $N$ and $L$ diverge while the density $\rho = N/L$ remains constant. We obtain an explicit solution for the extreme value in the thermodynamic limit, which recovers the Fréchet and Gumbel distributions in the low- and high-density limits, respectively, and reveals new, nontrivial behavior at intermediate densities. We then extend the framework to compact diffusion on fractal domains, showing that the walk dimension $d_w$ and fractal dimension $d_f$ control the extreme-value statistics via geometry-dependent scaling. The theory yields the full set of moments and finite-density corrections, providing a unified description of slowest-arrival times in confined Euclidean and fractal media.</p>

The variation in magnetic permeability enables tuning between repulsive and attractive interaction and a thermally unstable and measurable magnetic Casimir traps are predicted between a pair of ZnO-PS nanoparticles whose equilibrium position can be modulated over an order of magnitude with a small variation in the size of the magnetite nanoparticle.

            <p>Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moiré systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moiré systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moiré systems, including super-moiré with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moiré patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moiré, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moiré systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moiré systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Defects in atomically thin van der Waals materials have recently been investigated as sources of spin-photon entanglement with sensitivity to strain tuning. Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications.</p>

            <p>For the one-dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process with initial state a product measure of density $\rho=1/2-\delta$, $\delta\ge0$, there exists an infinite-time limiting state $\nu_\rho$ in which all particles are isolated and hence cannot move. We study the variance $V(L)$, under $\nu_\rho$, of the number of particles in an interval of $L$ sites. Under $\nu_{1/2}$ either all odd or all even sites are occupied, so that $V(L)=0$ for $L$ even and $V(L)=1/4$ for $L$ odd: the state is hyperuniform, since $V(L)$ grows more slowly than $L$. We prove that for densities approaching 1/2 from below there exist three regimes in $L$, in which the variance grows at different rates: for $L\gg\delta^{-2}$, $V(L)\simeq\rho(1-\rho)L$, just as in the initial state; for $A(\delta)\ll L\ll\delta^{-2}$, with $A(\delta)=\delta^{-2/3}$ for $L$ odd and $A(\delta)=1$ for $L$ even, $V(L)\simeq CL^{3/2}$ with $C=2\sqrt{2/\pi}/3$; and for $L\ll\delta^{-2/3}$ with $L$ odd, $V(L)\simeq1/4$. The analysis is based on a careful study of a renewal process with a long tail. Our study is motivated by simulation results showing similar behavior in higher dimensions; we discuss this background briefly.</p>

The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.</p>

            <p>We use standard techniques of hydrodynamics to construct a relativistic effective field theory for the low energy dynamics of nearly critical superfluids. In an appropriate non-relativistic limit, our theory predicts an additional coefficient when compared and contrasted to earlier work of Khalatnikov and Lebedev. In addition, we provide an alternative derivation of the same effective theory, using the Keldysh-Schwinger framework for non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we comment on the comparison with the results of an appropriate holographic computation presented in a companion paper. This provides further evidence in support of the theory we propose and confirms the existence of the extra coefficient we identified.</p>

            <p>Linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques compatible with high-throughput 4D-STEM acquisition are widely used to enhance phase contrast in weakly scattering and beam-sensitive materials. In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction.</p>

            <h2>Topological-Insulator and Spintronic Boundary Electrodynamics for MRI RF Coils: A Theoretical Framework for Loss, Noise, and Reciprocity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zoran Milosavljevic</p>
            <p>MRI radiofrequency (RF) coils are ultimately limited by conductor loss, thermal noise, and reciprocity constraints associated with conventional metallic boundary conditions. These limitations become more severe at higher static fields, where operating frequencies increase and current distributions are governed by surface impedance and electromagnetic coupling in the near field. In this work we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates topological-insulator (TI) surface transport and spintronic interface physics into RF coil electrodynamics. Starting from the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response (Kubo/Drude) transport, we derive an effective complex surface impedance for TI-coated conductors and establish modified boundary conditions for tangential fields in the presence of spin--momentum locking and spin--charge coupling. We then analyze time-reversal-symmetry-breaking TI/ferromagnet interfaces, where an anomalous Hall surface conductivity produces antisymmetric admittance and enables nonreciprocal RF response. Finally, we connect these results to MRI metrics including coil quality factor, thermal noise, and receive sensitivity through reciprocity-based formulations. The framework identifies parameter regimes in which topological and spintronic surface transport could reduce RF dissipation, modify noise mechanisms, and enable coil-level nonreciprocity without conventional ferrites.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian topological superconductivity from melting Abelian fractional Chern insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengyan Darius Shi, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) are exotic phases of matter realized at partial filling of a Chern band that host fractionally charged anyon excitations. Recent numerical studies in several microscopic models reveal that increasing the bandwidth in an FCI can drive a direct transition into a charge-2e superconductor rather than a conventional Fermi liquid. Motivated by this surprising observation, we propose a theoretical framework that captures the intertwinement between superconductivity and fractionalization in a lattice setting. Leveraging the duality between three field-theoretic descriptions of the Jain topological order, we find that bandwidth tuning can drive a single parent FCI at $\nu = 2/3$ into five different superconductors, some of which are intrinsically non-Abelian and support Majorana zero modes. Our results reveal a rich landscape of exotic superconductors with no normal state Fermi surface and predict novel higher-charge superconductors coexisting with neutral non-Abelian topological order at more general filling fractions $\nu = p/(2p+1)$.</p>

            <h2>Optimization of Si/SiGe Heterostructures for Large and Robust Valley Splitting in Silicon Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abel Thayil, Lasse Ermoneit, Lars R. Schreiber, Thomas Koprucki, Markus Kantner</p>
            <p>The notoriously low and fluctuating valley splitting is one of the key challenges for electron spin qubits in silicon (Si), limiting the scalability of Si-based quantum processors. In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the "modulated wiggle well," which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $\mu$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting.</p>

            <p>Collective quantum phenomena, such as the excitation of composite fermions1, spin waves2, and exciton condensation3,4, can emerge in strongly correlated systems like the fractional quantum Hall states5, spin liquids6, or excitonic insulators7. Two-dimensional (2D) moiré superlattices have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring such correlated phases and their associated collective excitations8,9. Specifically, electron crystals stabilized by longrange Coulomb interactions may host collective vibrational excitations emerging from electron correlations10, termed electronic phonons, which are fundamentally distinct from atomic lattice phonons. Despite theoretical prediction of their existence in moiré electron crystals11, direct experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of electronic phonons in the Mott insulating and stripe phases of a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, achieved through light scattering measurements. The phonon energies, temperature and filling factor dependencies, along with theoretical modeling, corroborate their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal. Polarization-resolved measurements further indicate rotational symmetry breaking in the Mott state. Notably, these electronic phonons exhibit strong tunability in energy, intensity, and polarization under external electric or magnetic fields, highlighting rich and controllable lattice dynamics of the electron crystal. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the electronic crystalline nature of correlated phases, opening avenues for probing and manipulating collective excitations in correlated electron systems.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Functional Properties of Manganese Pnictides: A First-Principles Study on Magneto-Optics and Magnetocaloric Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayendran S, Abhishek K G, Suresh R, Helmer Fjellvåg, Ravindran P</p>
            <p>Magnetic refrigeration presents an energy-efficient and environmentally benign alternative to traditional vapour-compression cooling technologies. It relies on the magnetocaloric effect, in which the temperature of a magnetic material changes in response to variations in an applied magnetic field. Optimal magnetocaloric materials are characterized by a significant change in magnetic entropy under moderate magnetic field. In this study, we systematically investigated the inter-atomic exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy energy and magnetocaloric properties of MnX (X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) using a combination of density functional theory and Monte-Carlo simulations. Additionally, the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday spectra were computed using the all-electron, fully relativistic, full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. The largest Kerr effect observed in MnBi can be inferred as a combined effect of maximal exchange splitting of Mn 3d states and the large spin-orbit coupling of Bi. To extract site-projected spin and orbital moments, spin-orbit coupling and orbital polarization correction are accounted in the present calculation, which shows good agreement between the moment obtained from the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism sum rule analysis, spin-polarized calculation, and experimental studies. The magnetic transition temperatures predicted through Monte-Carlo simulations were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. Our results provide a unified microscopic understanding of magnetocaloric performance and magneto-optical activity in Mn-based pnictides and establish a reliable computational framework for designing next-generation magnetic refrigeration materials.</p>

            <p>Plasmons in atomically thin materials offer a compelling route to trigger nonlinear light-matter interactions through extreme optical confinement in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. However, optical nonlocality in plasmons is typically associated with losses in the linear response regime. Here, we show that nonlocal effects mediate strong plasmon-assisted optical nonlinearity in electrically reconfigurable 2D heterostructures. Using atomistic simulations that capture quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonlinear plasmonic response of graphene and phosphorene nanoribbon dimers, we reveal how symmetry and inter-ribbon coupling shape harmonic generation processes in perturbative and high-harmonic regimes. Independent tuning of geometry and carrier density in nanoribbon heterostructures is shown to induce inter-ribbon plasmon hybridization, impacting inversion symmetry governing even-ordered nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation. These results reveal design principles for active and passive tuning of nonlinear plasmonic effects and enable selective enhancement of specific harmonic processes, establishing 2D heterostructures as a versatile platform for nonlinear nanophotonics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masoud Bahari, Kristian Mæland, Carsten Timm, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>We develop a general multipolar theory of strong spin-orbit coupling for large total angular momentum $j$ in time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j>1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.</p>

            <p>Using a combination of band representation analysis, inelastic neutron scattering (INS), magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements, and linear spin wave theory, we establish that the non-coplanar antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological nodal lines, Weyl points, and a three-fold degeneracy in its magnon band structure. The non-coplanar nature of the antiferromagnetic ordering protects the topological magnon nodal lines that transition into Weyl magnons upon the application of specific symmetry-breaking perturbations using an external magnetic field. Zero-field INS measurements confirm the existence of the topological magnon nodal lines through the pseudo-spin winding of the scattering intensity in angular scans near the nodal lines, indicating the non-trivial topology of the magnon wavefunctions. This work establishes a clear magnonic analog to Weyl electrons, allowing further exploration of topological behavior in bosonic systems, and highlighting the rich interplay between magnetic order and band topology in non-coplanar antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>Quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, featuring the simultaneous presence of high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$ $\sim 270$ K) and a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ $\sim 110$ K, is a rare system where strong interplay of spin dynamics, lattice vibrations, and electronic structure leads to a wide range of interesting phenomena. Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures.</p>

They exhibit strong type-II bulk superconductivity with moderate superconducting transition temperatures and upper critical fields. The estimated magnetic field-dependent critical current density lies in the range of 10$^5$--10$^6$~A/cm$^2$ across various temperatures, while the corresponding flux-pinning force density is on the order of GNm$^{-3}$, suggesting the potential of these materials for practical applications.

            <p>We investigate the interplay between nonreciprocal interactions and chemical-potential imbalance in a two-species nonreciprocal Blume-Capel model. Combining a systematic mean-field bifurcation analysis with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions, we map the model's dynamical regimes and transitions. Mean-field theory predicts a rich phase structure -- disorder, a time-dependent 'swap' (limit-cycle) phase, and static ordered states -- separated by Hopf, saddle-node on invariant circle, saddle-node of limit cycles, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations. In two dimensions, Monte Carlo simulations reveal that spiral defects destabilise global swapping and, unless vacancies are strongly favoured, destroy long-range order. Crucially, a finite single-ion anisotropy $\Delta_\alpha = - \Delta_\beta$ promotes vacancy occupation in the $\alpha$ species and suppresses nonreciprocal dynamics, thereby restoring a robust static ordered phase. Finite-size scaling of susceptibility and Binder cumulants places the disorder to static transition firmly in the 2D Ising universality class. Moreover, within the static ordered phase, we observe a crossover that sharpens into a line of first-order phase transitions; these two regimes are separated by a critical point, analogous to the termination of the liquid-gas coexistence curve. In three dimensions, simulations largely mirror mean-field expectations, though swap to static ordering occurs indirectly via a disordered regime. Our results demonstrate that vacancy energetics provide a simple, experimentally relevant control knob that stabilises equilibrium-like order in nonreciprocal systems and that defects can generate novel critical behaviour.</p>

Here, we reveal two intertwined phenomena in AlO_x/KTaO_3 heterostructures: a gate-history memory in which progressive electrostatic cycling enhances the superconducting transition temperature, and its complete erasure by light illumination at cryogenic temperatures. These phenomena arise from a previously unrecognized interplay between the superconducting interface and emergent lattice excitations - including polar-nanoregion reorientation and oxygen-vacancy ionization. These results demonstrate reconfigurable and non-volatile superconductivity at correlated oxide interfaces, opening a pathway to combine dissipationless transport with non-volatility for superconducting neuromorphic elements.</p>

We treat both solid friction, of the Amontons-Coulomb form; and lubricated friction, which scales with relative tangential velocity at the contact point. Dissipation functions in terms of the rod angular velocity are derived via a mean field approach for each form of friction, and from these, a Rayleighian for dense suspensions of rigid rods under shear constructed. Derivatives of this Rayleighian with respect to rod angular velocity and velocity gradient give a Smoluchowski equation and stress tensor, respectively. We show that these are representable as perturbations to Doi's model for a sheared liquid crystal. We also suggest a form for the average number of contacts between rods as a function of volume fraction, aspect ratio, and nematic order parameter, generalizing Philipse's random contact equation for disordered packings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Lizalde-Arroyo, Frederik Van Loock, Victoria Bernardo, Miguel Angel Rodriguez-Perez, Judith Martin-de Leon</p>
            <p>Nanocellular polyetherimide exhibits significant improvements in mechanical properties like toughness and impact resistance, commonly associated with the presence of nanoporosity. However, this work demonstrates these enhancements, often measured directly after processing, cannot be fully explained solely by the cellular structure but also originate from a modification of the polymer matrix induced by the CO2-saturation process. Through a systematic study involving thermal treatments and saturation-desorption processes without foaming, it is shown that CO2 exposure, even in the absence of pore formation, induces an apparent rejuvenation of the polymer, as evidenced by a reduction in the yield stress, which persists after complete CO2 desorption and in the absence of residual gas during mechanical testing. Therefore, the observed ductile response is not associated with the presence of CO2 during deformation, but with a permanent modification of the polymer matrix induced by prior gas exposure. This structural state can be thermally reversed by activating the beta relaxation of the polymer. For nanocellular polymers, the presence of residual gas within the matrix during foaming restricts thermal relaxation and helps preserve the CO2-modified state. As a result, the mechanical response of the solid phase reflects the intrinsic properties of the saturated polymer and the architecture imposed by the cellular structure. This work demonstrates for the first time that CO2 saturation can permanently alter the mechanical state of a high-Tg amorphous polymer, providing a new framework to interpret the brittle-to-ductile transition in nanocellular PEI.</p>

            <p>The possibility of a zero temperature, altermagnetic instability in anisotropic two dimensional electron systems in the diffusive regime is analyzed, in the presence and absence of spin-orbit coupling. Allowing for ferromagnetism, a phase diagram is built as a function of the parameter that controls anisotropy and the strength of the interactions. It is found that, at zero spin orbit coupling, ferromagnetism only dominates at small values of anisotropy and coupling constant. Larger values of these parameters favour the formation of altermagnetism. At finite spin-orbit coupling, a paramagnetic phase competes with the other two, and a quantum critical point appears. The phase transition from the paramagnetic to the magnetically ordered phases is of second order, while the phase transition between ferromagnet and altermagnet states is first order. The altermagnetic phase is robust under small magnetic fields, displaying a coexistence with a field-induced magnetization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. W. F. Venderbos</p>
            <p>Condensed matter physics is often concerned with determining the response of a solid to an external stimulus. This paper revisits and extends the microscopic formalism for calculating response coefficients -- here referred to as (generalized) polarizabilities -- in crystalline electronic insulators. The main focus is on the Berry phase polarization and orbital magnetization, for which we obtain general formulas describing the linear response to an arbitrary (but static and uniform) perturbation. The response of an arbitrary lattice-periodic observable (e.g. spin, layer pseudospin) to electric and magnetic fields is also examined, and serves as a basis for mircoscopically establishing Maxwell relations between conjugate generalized polarizabilities. We furthermore introduce and examine the notion of Berry curvature or Hall vector polarizability, i.e., the response of the Berry curvature to a general perturbation, and show how it relates to Berry phase polarization and orbital magnetization responses. For all polarizabilities considered, we obtain simplified formulas applicable to two- and four-band models, expressed directly in terms of the Hamiltonian and the perturbation. Three specific applications of these formulas are discussed: (i) a computation of the magnetoelectric polarizabilities of model antiferromagnets in one and two dimensions; (ii) a general proof of (quasi)topological signatures in the polarizabilities of Dirac fermions in two dimensions; (iii) a calculation of the strain-induced Berry curvature polarizability in an altermagnet.</p>

            <h2>Tree tensor networks for many-body localization in two dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lars Humpert, Dante M. Kennes, Jan-Niklas Herre</p>
            <p>We investigate the disordered spin-$\frac12$Heisenberg model in two dimensions and employ tree tensor networks (TTNs) with a physics-informed structural optimization of the tree layout, to simulate dynamics in the many-body localization problem. We find that TTNs are able to capture two-dimensional entanglement patterns more effectively than matrix product states (MPS) while being more efficient to contract than projected entangled pair states (PEPS) to probe larger systems and longer times. Structural optimization of the trees based on time evolution of the entanglement in the system allows to keep the necessary bond dimensions low and to maximally exploit the increased expressiveness of TTNs over MPS. In this way, we achieve more accurate results in all considered parameter regimes both below and above the ergodicity-to-localization crossover at a comparable compute-time cost.</p>

            <h2>Tuning Separator Chemistry: Improving Zn Anode Compatibility via Functionalized Chitin Nanofibers</h2>

            <p>Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.</p>

            <p>The effects of uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain on the $\rho_{xx}$ and $\rho_{yy}$ components of the resistivity tensor, and the commensurable-nearly commensurate CDW (CCDW-NCCDW) transition temperature in 1T-TaS$_2$ are studied. At room temperature, uniaxial tensile strain increases the resistivity tensor components by a comparable magnitude both parallel and perpendicular to the strain axis. In the case of biaxial strain, up to 20~K decrease in the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperature is observed. In the case of uniaxial strain, a new phase with two different CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperatures is observed, the splitting exceeds 10 K. The occurrence of such a phase is associated with the transition of the CDW into the commensurate state along the tensile strain direction while maintaining nearly commensurability along the perpendicular one. The results allow to justify various models widely used in analysis of transport properties of 1T-TaS$_2$ in commensurate and nearly commensurate states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Schuyler B. Nicholson, Luis Pedro García-Pintos</p>
            <p>Chemical and biological networks can describe a wide variety of processes, from gene regulatory networks to biochemical oscillations. Modeled by chemical master equations, these processes are inherently stochastic, as fluctuations dominate deterministic order at mesoscopic scales. These classic many-body processes suffer from the so-called curse of high dimensionality, which makes exact mathematical descriptions exponentially expensive to compute. The exponential cost renders the study of the thermodynamic properties of such systems out of equilibrium intractable and forces approximations of system noise or assumptions of continuous particle numbers. Here, we use tensor networks to numerically explore the thermodynamics of chemical processes by directly solving the ensemble solution of the chemical master equation with efficient (sub-exponential) computational cost. We provide accurate estimates of the entropy production rate, heat flux, chemical work, and nonequilibrium thermodynamic potentials, free from sampling errors or mean-field approximations. We illustrate our results through a dissipative self-assembly model. In this way, we show how tensor networks can inform the design of efficient chemical processes in previously unattainable regimes.</p>

            <h2>Influence of Magnetic Order on Proximity-Induced Superconductivity in Mn Layers on Nb(110) from First Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sohair ElMeligy, Balázs Újfalussy, Kyungwha Park</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of magnetic order on the proximity-induced superconducting state in the Mn layers of a Mn-Nb(110) heterostructure by using a first-principles method. For this study, we use the recently developed Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) solver for superconducting heterostructures [Csire et al., Phys. Rev. B 97, 024514 (2018)] within the first-principles calculations based on multiple scattering theory and the screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SKKR) Green's function method. In our calculations, we first study the normal-state density of states (DOS) in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures, and calculate the induced magnetic moments in the Nb layers. Next, we compute the momentum-resolved spectral functions in the superconducting state for the heterostructure with a single Mn layer, and find bands crossing the Fermi level within the superconducting (SC) gap. We also study the SC state DOS in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures and compare some of our results with experimental findings, revealing secondary gaps, plateau-like regions, and central V-shaped in-gap states within the bulk SC Nb gap that are magnetic-order-dependent. Finally, we compute the singlet and internally antisymmetric triplet (IAT) order parameters for each layer for both heterostructures, and find an order of magnitude difference in the induced singlet part of the SC order parameter in the Mn layer/s between the FM and AFM cases in favor of the AFM pairing with the maximum still being only 4.44% of the bulk Nb singlet order parameter value. We also find a negligible induced triplet part, yet comparable to the induced singlet values, indicating some singlet-triplet mixing in the Mn layer/s.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiyu Chen, Jernej Mravlje, Denis Golež, Philipp Werner</p>
            <p>We show that the nonlinear optical response probed by two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) can discriminate between excitonic and lattice driven order. In the excitonic regime of a realistic model of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, the third order 2DCS signals are strongly enhanced by the condensate's amplitude and phase modes, with negligible contributions from single-particle excitations. In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order.</p>

            <h2>Topological cluster synchronization via Dirac spectral programming on directed hypergraphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yupeng Guo, Ahmed A. A. Zaid, Xueming Liu, Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Collective synchronization in complex systems arises from the interplay between topology and dynamics, yet how to design and control such patterns in higher-order networks remains unclear. Here we show that a Dirac spectral programming framework enables programmable topological cluster synchronization on directed hypergraphs. By encoding tail-head hyperedges into a topological Dirac operator and introducing a tunable mass term, we obtain a spectrum whose isolated eigenvalues correspond to distinct synchronization clusters defined jointly on nodes and hyperedges. Selecting a target eigenvalue allows the system to self-organize toward the associated cluster state without modifying the underlying hypergraph structure. Simulations on directed-hypergraph block models and empirical systems--including higher-order contact networks and the ABIDE functional brain network--confirm that spectral selection alone determines the accessible synchronization patterns. Our results establish a general and interpretable route for controlling collective dynamics in directed higher-order systems.</p>

            <p>Developing fault-tolerant quantum processors with error correction demands large arrays of physical qubits whose key performance metrics (coherence times, control fidelities) must remain within specifications over both short and long timescales. Here we investigated the temporal stability of subtractively fabricated CMOS-compatible superconducting transmon qubits. During a single cooldown and over a period of 95 hours, we monitored several parameters for 8 qubits, including coherence times $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, which exhibit fluctuations originating primarily from the interaction between two-level system (TLS) defects and the host qubit. We also demonstrate that subtractively-fabricated superconducting quantum devices align with the theoretical predictions that higher mean lifetimes $T_1$ correspond to larger fluctuations. To assess long-term stability, we tracked two representative qubits over 10 cooldown cycles spanning more than one year. We observed an average total downward shift in both qubit transition frequencies of approximately 61 MHz within the thermal cycles considered. In contrast, readout resonator frequencies decreased only marginally. Meanwhile, $T_1$ exhibits fluctuations from cycle to cycle, but maintains a stable baseline value.</p>

            <p>Strong light-matter coupling enables hybrid states in which photonic and electronic degrees of freedom become correlated even in the ground state. While many-body effects in long-range dispersion interactions are known to reshape electronic properties under such conditions, their impact on quantum-optical observables remains largely unexplored. Here, we address this problem using quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) combined with the recently developed photon-many-body dispersion (pMBD) functional, which can capture higher-order electron-photon correlations and multi-photon processes. We compute ground-state photonic observables including photon number fluctuations, second-order correlations, and quadrature variances, and find squeezing and super-Poissonian photon statistics emerging from light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full hierarchy of many-body, electron-photon and multi-photon correlations is essential for a consistent description of quantum-optical properties in strongly coupled molecular systems, establishing QEDFT as a first-principles framework for predicting nonclassical photonic features in the ground state of complex systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate multiscale Gibbs measures from a variational and probabilistic viewpoint, focusing on the structural asymmetry among conditional entropies that characterizes their construction. We show how this asymmetry emerges both from variational principles with entropic constraints and from stochastic processes with reinforcement. We thus introduce the reinforced multinomial process and prove a large-deviation principle for its empirical histogram. The associated rate function reproduces precisely the entropy imbalance defining multiscale measures, thereby providing a genuine probabilistic mechanism for their emergence. The reinforced multinomial process thus offers a simple and rigorous stochastic foundation for multiscale Gibbs structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno H. S. Mendonça, Elizane E. de Moraes, Hélio Chacham</p>
            <p>Water nanoconfinement is known to occur inside material void spaces, such as 2D confinement between surfaces, 1D confinement inside nanotubes, and variable-dimension confinement inside nanoporous materials. In the present work we investigate, through molecular dynamics simulations, the morphologies and self-diffusion coefficient of water channels that are nanoconfined in the void space between adjacent surfaces of nanotube bundles - an existing class of materials. In our simulations, we begin with water filling completely the void space, and then we progressively increase the inter-surface separation, maintaining the water content. We find that, as the inter-surface separation progresses, the dimensionality of the water channel decreases from 2D to 1D, the latter consisting of self-confined water channels along surface grooves. The morphologies and self-diffusion coefficients of these 1D water nanochannels are strongly dependent on the nature of the water-surface interaction and on the diameter of the nanotubes. Interestingly, as we decrease the nanotube diameter from 10 to 5 nm, the self-diffusion coefficients of the 1D channels increase by tenfold for hydrophilic surfaces and by sixfold for hydrophobic surfaces, surpassing, in both cases, the bulk water values. We also investigated the water channels at the interstitial voids of the bulk bundle material, finding 1D water channels that are similar to the surface ones.</p>

            <p>The quantum dissipative time evolution of a fluxonium under a pulsed field (kicks) is studied numerically and analytically. In the classical limit the system dynamics is converged to a strange chaotic attractor. The quantum properties of this system are studied for the density matrix in the frame of Lindblad equation. In the case of dissipative quantum evolution the steady-state density matrix is converged to a quantum strange attractor being similar to the classical one. It is shown that depending on the dissipation strength there is a regime when the eigenstates of density matrix are localized at a strong or moderate dissipation. At a weak dissipation the eigenstates are argued to be delocalized being linked to the Ehrenfest explosion of quantum wave packet. This phenomenon is related with the Lyapunov exponent and Ehrenfest time for the quantum strange attractor. Possible experimental realisations of this quantum strange attractor with fluxonium are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas M Payne, Furqan Alabdullah, Paola Borri, Wolfgang Langbein</p>
            <p>Quantitative polarisation-resolved optical extinction microscopy of individual plasmonic nanoparticles has recently been introduced as a powerful tool to characterise the nanoparticle's morphology with a precision comparable to electron microscopy, while using a simple optical microscope [Nanoscale 12, 16215 (2020)]. Here we extend the technique by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are quantitatively described by an ellipsoid model, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements. Evaluation the distribution of the fit error across the set of measured particles, the material permittivity dataset and surface damping parameter g providing the best fit are found to be the single crystal dataset by Olmon et al. [Phys. Rev. B 86, 235147 (2012)] and g = 1.8, respectively. The precision of the retrieved aspect ratio is below 5%, and all three ellipsoidal semi-axes are determined with an impressive precision of 0.25 nm. Notably, corrections to the Rayleigh-Gans ellipsoid model due to retardation are significant even though the particle diameters are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength, and taking them into account improves the accuracy to below a nanometer.</p>

            <p>Noisy monitored quantum circuits have emerged as a versatile and unifying framework connecting quantum many-body physics, quantum information, and quantum computation. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in understanding the dynamics of such circuits, with an emphasis on their entanglement structure, information-protection capabilities, and noise-induced phase transitions. A central theme is the mapping to classical statistical models, which reveals how quantum noise reshapes dominant spin configurations. This framework elucidates universal scaling behaviors, including the characteristic $q^{-1/3}$ entanglement scaling with noise probability $q$ and distinct timescales for information protection. We further highlight a broad range of constructions and applications inspired by noisy monitored circuits, spanning variational quantum algorithms, classical simulation methods, mixed-state phases of matter, and emerging approaches to quantum error mitigation and quantum error correction. These developments collectively establish noisy monitored circuits as a powerful platform for probing and controlling quantum dynamics in realistic, decohering environments.</p>

            <p>The holographic product formula is used to determine the general form taken by holographic spectral functions in the near-extremal hydrodynamic regime, with energy $\omega$, momentum $k$ and temperature $T$ much smaller than a hard scale $\mu$. The resulting expressions simplify in the extremal limit $T \ll \omega,k\ll \mu$, for which the low-temperature gapless modes and the IR conformal behavior factorize. In some cases, this factorization extends to the general near-extremal regime $\omega,k,T\ll\mu$ at leading order in $T/\mu$. Several examples are discussed with different types of gapless modes and IR CFTs, including new numerical results for low temperature quasi-normal modes. We end with a concrete application that shows how the inclusion of the IR conformal behavior improves the description of the spectral function at low energies.</p>

            <p>We study DC and AC thermoelectric and magneto-transport in 2D quantum critical theories with strong translational symmetry breaking due to a % varying chemical potential lattice with zero average $\bar{\mu}=0$. The combination of quantum criticality and the absence of the average natural scale implies that such systems have idiosyncratic signatures that may apply more generally when the variance in the lattice potential far exceeds the average or for strong translational symmetry breaking in general. We model such theories holographically through near-extremal AdS black holes. We find that these systems (a) become \emph{better} conductors. In a 2D lattice, this can be explained by currents flowing around obstacles; (b) exhibit bad-metal electrical transport with Drude-like thermal transport, though it is not Drude, and, notably, (c) display an approximately $B$-linear longitudinal magnetoresistance at large fields, similar to Effective Medium Theory. We comment on how these results may apply when $\bar{\mu}\neq 0$.</p>

            <p>We show that the semiclassical limit of thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations naturally reconstructs the algebro-geometric spectra of finite-gap periodic potentials. This correspondence is illustrated using the traveling-wave (snoidal) solution of the defocusing modified Korteweg--de Vries equation. In this framework, the Bethe-root distribution of the associated quantum field theory yields an Abelian differential of the second kind on the elliptic Riemann surface specified by the spectral endpoints, a structure central to the algebro-geometric theory of solitons. The semiclassical parameter is identified with the large-rank limit of the internal symmetry group ($O(2N)$) of the underlying quantum field theory (the Gross-Neveu model with a chemical potential). Our analysis indicates that the analytic structure of the spectrum is dictated solely by the Dynkin diagram ($D_N$) and its large-rank limit ($D_\infty$), independently of the particular integrable model used to realize it.</p>

            <p>We evaluate using programmable superconducting flux qubit D-Wave quantum annealers to approximate the partition function of Ising models. We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. Remarkably, we find that fast quench-like anneals can quickly generate ensemble distributions that are very good estimates of the true partition function of the classical Ising model; on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU we report a logarithmic relative error of $7.6 \times 10^{-6}$, from $171,000$ samples generated using $0.2$ seconds of QPU time with an anneal time of $8$ nanoseconds per sample which is interestingly within the closed system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>One of the critical challenges in enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells is reducing the density of trap states in the light-absorbing perovskite layer. These trap states lead to increased charge carrier recombination, thus dropping device efficiency. Space charge limited current (SCLC) analysis serves as a valuable method to study trap density, requiring structures capable of selectively transporting either electrons or holes. By analyzing current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and identifying the voltage at which the slope changes, trap density can be calculated effectively. Traditional organic polymer hole transport layers such as Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, and PTAA face challenges, including moisture instability, low charge mobility, low conductivity, and high costs. This work introduces a novel hole-only device structure utilizing inorganic materials, offering improved stability, straightforward fabrication, and reduced costs compared to conventional structures. This device comprises a nanostructured NiOx layer, a perovskite layer, a copper indium selenide (CIS) layer, and an Au electrode on an ITO substrate. The performance of this structure is assessed by fabricating various perovskite layers under different experimental conditions. The trap density was successfully determined using the proposed hole-only device structure. Analysis of the photovoltaic properties revealed a clear correlation between trap density in the perovskite layers and the overall performance of the solar cells.</p>

            <p>The crystallographic orientation of films grown on 2D-masked substrates is often used to infer the pathway among remote, van der Waals, and thru-hole (pinhole-seeded) epitaxy. However, attribution of a specific growth mechanism based on orientation can be ambiguous unless mask continuity and substrate pre-treatment are evaluated within a single process window. We compare GaN grown under identical conditions on four m-plane sapphire templates: (i) bare, (ii) "graphene-grown" (high-temperature Ar/H2 with CH4 on), (iii) "anneal-only" (high-temperature Ar/H2 with CH4 off), and (iv) graphene oxide spin-coated and reduced on pristine sapphire. GaN selects (103) on graphene-grown and anneal-only m-plane sapphire, selects (100) on bare m-plane sapphire, and is predominantly (100) with a minority (103) on graphene oxide spin-coated and reduced/pristine m-plane sapphire. High-resolution TEM shows that, on partly graphene-covered samples, nucleation occurs on exposed sapphire (thru-hole), not on graphene, providing mechanism evidence independent of orientation. Within this window, the substrate surface state set by high-temperature Ar/H2 pre-treatment (rather than mask continuity) primarily governs orientation, while open-area effects can play a secondary role. Thus, preferred orientation alone may not determine the growth mechanism; mask continuity and substrate pre-treatment must be explicitly controlled when using orientation as evidence for mechanism assignment.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium Bounds for Canonical Nonlinearity Under Single-Shot Work</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koretaka Yuge, Yutaro Sakamoto</p>
            <p>For classical discrete systems under constant composition (specifically substitutional alloys), canonical average acts as a map from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to a set of configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, which is generally nonlinear. In terms of the configurational geometry (i.e., information about configurational density of states), the nonlinearity has been measured as special vector on configuration space, which is extended to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on statistical manifold. Although they successfully provide new insight into how the geometry of lattice characterizes the nonlinearity, their application is essentially restricted to thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the resource theory (especially, thermo-majorization), we here extend the applicability of the nonlinearity to nonequilibrium states obtained through single-shot work on Gibbs state. We reveal that the extended nonlinearity for nonequilibrium state is bounded from upper and lower by the information about one of the optimal Renyi divergences for equilibrium states in between practical and linear systems, and temperature and work.</p>

            <h2>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl J Friston, Maxwell J D Ramstead, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel</p>
            <p>We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bogdan Guster, Maxime Braun, Eric Bousquet</p>
            <p>We study from \textit{ab~initio} density functional theory calculations the structural and magnetic properties of the crystal KCoF$_3$. We found that the experimentally reported cubic to tetragonal phase transition is due to an electronic first-order Jahn-Teller effect from the R zone boundary point. We also obtain that the magnetic ground state is the G-type antiferromagnetic order, in agreement with the R-point Jahn-Teller distortion and that the magnetic moment of the Co atoms contains a strong orbital contribution ($m_L=0.95$ $\mu_B$ in the cubic phase and 0.55 $\mu_B$ in the tetragonal phase). Furthermore, we compute the dynamical magnetic effective charges and show that it is zero by symmetry for the Co and they can reach a value as large as 200 $10^{-2}\mu_{\text{B}}/\text{Å}$ for the apical F anion. This large magnetic effective charge comes from the spin-orbit coupling (50\% of the response is from the orbital moment) contrary to the rare-earth manganites and ferrites with similar order of magnitude but originating from the exchange striction mechanism. The fact that the dynamical magnetic effective charges are non-zero also proves that the tetragonal phase of KCoF$_3$ is antimagnetoelectric with a large magnetic sublattice magnetoelectric response of 210 ps/m per spin-channel. We also discuss the generality of these magnetic effective charges.</p>

            <h2>Generalized free energy and excess/housekeeping decomposition in nonequilibrium systems: from large deviations to thermodynamic speed limits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artemy Kolchinsky, Andreas Dechant, Kohei Yoshimura, Sosuke Ito</p>
            <p>In genuine nonequilibrium systems that undergo continuous driving, the thermodynamic forces are nonconservative, meaning they cannot be described by any free energy potential. Nonetheless, we show that the dynamics of such systems are governed by a "generalized free energy" that is derived from a large-deviations variational principle. This variational principle also yields a decomposition of fluxes, forces, and dissipation (entropy production) into a conservative "excess" part and a nonconservative "housekeeping" part. Our decomposition is universally applicable to stochastic master equations, deterministic chemical reaction networks, and open systems. We also show that the excess entropy production obeys a thermodynamic speed limit (TSL), a fundamental thermodynamic constraint on the rate of state evolution and/or external fluxes. We demonstrate our approach on several examples, including real-world metabolic networks, where we derive fundamental dissipation bounds and uncover "futile" metabolic cycles. Our generalized free energy and decomposition are empirically accessible to thermodynamic inference in both stochastic and deterministic systems. We discuss important connections to several theoretical frameworks, including information geometry and Onsager theory, as well as previous excess/housekeeping decompositions.</p>

            <h2>Orbital magnetization as the origin of the nonlinear Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zesheng Zhang, Xin-Zhi Li, Wen-Yu He</p>
            <p>The nonlinear Hall effect is a new type of Hall effect that has recently attracted significant attention. For the physical origin of the nonlinear Hall effect, while orbital magnetization has long been hypothesized to underpin the nonlinear Hall effect, a general relation between the two quantities remains elusive. Here, we resolve the problem by deriving the first explicit formula connecting the electric field induced orbital magnetization to the second order Hall conductivity. Our theory reveals that the applied electric field plays dual roles in generating the nonlinear Hall effect: it first generates nonequlibrium orbital magnetization associated with an edge current, and subsequently perturbs the circulating edge states to produce transverse Hall voltage. For the experimental verification, we propose to apply a combination of direct and alternative currents to identify the circulating edge current in the nonlinear Hall effect. Based on the orbital magnetization origin, we point out that in isotropic chiral metals of T and O point groups, the crystalline symmetry suppresses the nonlinear Hall response for a monochromatic linear polarized electric field, but a non-collinear bichromatic electric field can generate a finite nonlinear Hall current that manifests the chiral correlation of the field. This discovery finally enables us to incorporate both the nonlinear Hall effect and circular photo-galvanic effect into the framework of orbital magnetization.</p>

Analyzing the effects of electronic correlations on the lowest-order electron-phonon processes, we show that in the proximity of the Mott metal-to-insulator transition of the doped square lattice Hubbard model, where the isothermal charge response becomes particularly large at small momenta, the coupling of electrons to the lattice is strongly increased. This, in turn, induces significant corrections to both the electronic self-energy and phonon-mediated pairing interaction, indicating the possible onset of a strong interplay between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom even for small values of the bare electron-phonon coupling.</p>

            <p>Haldane's tight-binding model, which describes a Chern insulator in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, exhibits quantum Hall conductivity without an external magnetic field. Here, we explore an $\alpha -T_{3}$ lattice subjected to circularly polarized off-resonance light. This lattice, composed of two sublattices (A and B) and a central site (C) per unit cell, undergoes deformation by varying the hopping parameter $\gamma _{1}$ while keeping $\gamma _{2}$= $\gamma _{3}$= $\gamma $. Analytical expressions for quasi-energies in the first Brillouin zone reveal significant effects of symmetry breaking. Circularly polarized light lifts the degeneracy of Dirac points, shifting the cones from M. This deformation evolves with $\gamma _{1} $, breaking symmetry at $\gamma _{1}=2\gamma $, as observed in Berry curvature diagrams. In the standard case ($\gamma _{1}=\gamma $), particle-hole and inversion symmetries are preserved for $\alpha =0$ and $% \alpha =1$. The system transitions from a semi-metal to a Chern insulator, with band-specific Chern numbers: $C_{2}=1$, $C_{1}=0$, and $C_{0}=-1$ for $% \alpha <1/\sqrt{2},$ shifting to $C_{2}=2$, $C_{1}=0$, and $C_{0}=-2$ when $% \alpha \geqslant 1/\sqrt{2}.$For $\gamma _{1}>2\gamma $, the system enters a trivial insulating phase. These transitions, confirmed via Wannier charge centers, are accompanied by a diminishing Hall conductivity. Our findings highlight tunable topological phases in $\alpha -T_{3}$ lattices, driven by light and structural deformation, with promising implications for quantum materials.</p>

We consider both the Hermitian (Tamm-Dancoff approximation) and pseudo-Hermitian forms, addressing dense matrices of three different sizes. A description of the implementation is also provided, with details for the pseudo-Hermitian case. Timing and memory utilization are analyzed on both CPU and GPU clusters.

            <h2>Modulation of Polarization and Metallicity in Janus Sliding Ferroelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshay Mahajan, Awadhesh Narayan</p>
            <p>Sliding ferroelectricity is emerging as a distinct and promising mechanism for realizing ferroelectricity in low-dimensional systems, offering new design principles beyond the conventional ferroelectric mechanism. Further, the coexistence of the out-of-plane polarization with in-plane conductivity induced by electrostatic charge doping makes these systems strong candidates for realizing ferroelectric metals. Using density functional theory calculations, we analyze the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based Janus sliding ferroelectric bilayers XMY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, Te; X $\neq$ Y). In addition to exhibiting switchable interlayer polarization, Janus sliding ferroelectrics possess an intrinsic electric field within each monolayer, arising from the electronegativity difference between the chalcogen atoms. We discover that the intrinsic electric field of the monolayers can be used to modulate the interlayer ferroelectric polarization and the electronic band structure. We identify the decrease in the interlayer distance due to a particular stacking of the Janus bilayers as a major contributor to increasing polarization and reducing the bandgap. The direction of the intrinsic electric field within the Janus monolayers plays a significant role in the modulation of layer-wise contribution in the valence and conduction bands, which influences the polarization reduction due to extrinsic charge dopants. Extending this concept to Janus trilayers, we observe further enhancement in polarization and additional bandgap reduction compared to their bilayer counterparts. These results highlight the tunability of TMD-based Janus sliding ferroelectrics and suggest a pathway for designing low bandgap ferroelectrics and potential ferroelectric metals.</p>

            <p>We present a new formulation of the lack-of-fit reduction in non-equilibrium thermodynamics using the path-integral formalism. The formulation is based on the Onsager-Machlup variational principle, and it allows us to find reduced dynamical equations by minimizing information discrepancy with respect to the detailed evolution. The reduced evolution consists of a Hamiltonian vector field and a gradient flow. The reduction method is illustrated on the Kac-Zwanzig model, where we show how irreversibility emerges from purely Hamiltonian evolution by ignoring some degrees of freedom. We also show how to generalize the Fisher information matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions to the case when the two distributions are related by the principle of maximum entropy, even in the case when the entropy is not of Boltzmann-Gibbs type (for instance Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adarsh Raghu, Izaak Neri</p>
            <p>We develop a method for deriving thermodynamic bounds for first-passage problems of currents with two boundaries in Markov chains. Using this method, we derive a thermodynamic bound on the rate of dissipation in terms of the splitting probability and the first-passage time statistics of a fluctuating current, which is a refinement of a previously derived inequality. We also show that the concept of effective affinity, originally developed for continuous-time Markov chains, naturally extends to discrete-time Markov chains. Furthermore, we analyse symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents with two boundaries. We show that optimal currents -- those for which the effective affinity fully accounts for the dissipation -- satisfy a symmetry property: the current's average speed to reach the positive threshold equals the current's speed to reach the negative threshold. The developed approach uses a coarse-graining procedure for the average entropy production at random times and uses martingale methods to perform time-reversal of first-passage quantities.</p>

            <p>Recent years have seen a vast increase in research into van der Waals magnetic materials. In many of these systems, magnetism is introduced via light 3\textit{d}-transition metal elements, combined with chalcogenides or halogens. Despite the high technological promise in the field of spintronics, the connection between the \textit{d}-orbital configuration and the occurrence of low-dimensional magnetic order is currently unclear. Here we address the prototypical two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI\textsubscript{3}, via complementary spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations. We reveal the electronic structure and orbital character of bulk CrI\textsubscript{3} in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, describing the couplings underpinning its energy diagram, and providing a robust experimental demonstration that the mechanism of stabilization of ferromagnetism is attributable to orbital mixing between I \textit{p} and Cr \textit{e\textsubscript{g}} states. These findings reveal the microscopic connection between orbital and spin degrees of freedom, providing fundamental insights into the behavior of low-dimensional magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Programmable assembly of nanoparticles into structures other than hexagonal lattices remains challenging. Assembling an open checkerboard or square lattice is harder to achieve compared to a close-packed hexagonal structure. Here, we introduce a unified, robust approach to assemble nanoparticles into a diverse family of two-dimensional superlattices at the liquid-air interface. Gold nanoparticles are grafted with pH-responsive, water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminating in -COOH or -NH2 end groups, enabling control over interparticle interactions, while the grafted polymer's molecular weight dictates its conformation. This combined control crystallizes checkerboard, simple-square, and body-centered honeycomb superlattices. We find that even for identical nanoparticle core sizes, the polymer's molecular weight dictates superlattice symmetry and stability. Furthermore, tuning pH induces structural transitions between different lattice types. This method opens new avenues for the programmable fabrication of colloidal superstructures with tailored architectures.</p>

            <p>We consider an extended spinless Falicov--Kimball model at an arbitrary doping level, focusing on the range of parameter values where a uniform excitonic insulator is stabilised at half-filling. We compare the properties of possible uniform phases and construct the Hartree--Fock phase diagrams, which include sizeable phase separation regions. It is seen that the excitonic insulator can appear as a component phase in a mixed-phase state in a broad interval of doping levels. In addition, in a certain range of parameter values the excitonic metal (doped excitonic insulator) is identified as the lowest-energy uniform phase. We suggest that this phase, which is unstable with respect to phase separation, may be stabilised when the phase separation is suppressed by the long-range Coulomb interaction. Overall, we find that excitonic correlations can affect the behaviour of the system relatively far away from half-filling.</p>

            <p>Crystalline two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors often combine high elasticity and in-plane strength, making them ideal for strain-induced tuning of electronic characteristics, akin to strategies used in silicon electronics. However, existing techniques have not achieved strain in 2D materials that is simultaneously high in magnitude (>1%), stable over long periods, and spatially programmable, meaning the strain level can be deterministically engineered across different regions of a single 2D layer. Here, we apply spatially programmable biaxial strain (e_b) up to 2.2% with spatial resolution of 0.13 %e_b um-1 in monolayer MoS2 via conformal transfer onto patterned substrates fabricated using two-photon lithography. The induced strain is stable for months and enables local band gap tuning of ~0.4 eV in monolayer MoS2, ~25% of its intrinsic band gap. We further extend the approach to bilayer WS2-MoS2 heterostructures. This strain-engineering technique introduces a new regime of strain-enabled control in 2D semiconductors to support the development of wide-spectrum optoelectronic devices and nanoelectronics with engineered electronic landscapes.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions formed by finite-length topological superconductors host four Majorana zero modes when the phase difference between the superconductors is $\varphi=\pi$ and their length is larger than the Majorana localization length. While this picture is understood in terms of a Hermitian description of isolated junctions, unavoidable transport conditions due to coupling to reservoirs make them open and ground for non-Hermitian effects that still remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Hermiticity on Josephson junctions hosting four Majorana zero modes when they are coupled to normal leads. We demonstrate that, depending on whether inner or outer Majorana zero modes are subjected to non-Hermiticity, Andreev exceptional points can form between lowest (higher energy) Andreev bound states connected by stable zero real energy lines. We further find that the Andreev exceptional points give rise to strong local and nonlocal spectral weights, thus providing a way for their identification via, e.g., conductance measurements. Our findings unveil non-Hermiticity for designing non-Hermitian topological phases and for operating Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions hosting Majorana zero modes.</p>

            <p>Identifying the microscopic processes that limit conductivity is essential for understanding correlated and quantum-critical states in quantum materials. In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other twist-controlled materials, the temperature dependence of metallic resistivity follows power-law scaling, with the exponent spanning a broad range, rendering standard transport measurements insufficient to unambiguously identify the dominant scattering processes and giving rise to competing interpretations ranging from phonon-limited transport and umklapp scattering to strange metallicity and heavy fermion renormalization. Here, we use terahertz (THz) excitation to selectively raise the electron temperature in TBG while keeping the lattice cold, enabling a direct separation of electron-electron and electron-phonon contributions to resistivity. We observe a giant THz photoresistance, reaching up to 70% in magic-angle devices, demonstrating that electronic interactions dominate transport even in regimes previously attributed to phonons, including the linear-in-temperature resistivity near the magic angle. Away from the magic angle, we observe coexisting photoresistance and robust quadratic-in-temperature resistivity at extremely low carrier densities where standard electron-electron scattering mechanisms (umklapp and Baber inter-band scattering) are kinematically forbidden. Our analysis identifies the breakdown of Galilean invariance in the Dirac-type dispersion as a possible origin of the interaction-limited conductivity, arising from inter-valley electron-electron collisions. Beyond twisted bilayer graphene, our approach establishes THz-driven hot-electron transport as a general framework for disentangling scattering mechanisms in low-density quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.</p>

            <p>We use a first-principles calculations approach to reveal the electronic and magnetic properties of chromium diiodide (CrI$_2$) bilayers and establish a hierarchy of magnetic interactions across stable registries. The monolayer presents a x-stripe antiferromagnetic ground state, while in bilayers the BA$^\prime$ stacking is the global minimum with antiparallel interlayer magnetic alignment. Bilayer configurations strengthen the exchange in the plane by 6 % to 10 %, while the exchange between layers is registry-dependent. The symmetry of each stacking configuration allows for anisotropic interactions. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms appear in structures without inversion symmetry, which in this case also generates in-plane polarizations of up to $\sim$ 10 $\mu$C/cm$^2$, resulting in direct magnetoelectric coupling that is absent in centrosymmetric monolayers. Thus, stacking acts both as a selector of exchange anisotropy and as a driver of magnetoelectricity. Our results show that bilayer CrI$_2$ can be mechanically reconfigured through interlayer sliding, with energy differences between stacking orders (25-50 meV/f.u.) that are compatible with experimental actuation. Tunable magnetism and register-dependent polarization offer promising opportunities for novel spintronic devices, where structural transitions can affect both magnetic states and electric dipoles.</p>

            <p>Active navigation in disordered media depends on a biased random walk interacting with environmental constraints. Using E. coli chemotactic navigation in agar gels as a model system, we reveal a fundamental trade-off between diffusive exploration and chemotactic directional bias that dictates the optimal strategy for population range expansion. Counter-intuitively, evolution selects for shorter mean run times ({\tau}_f) to achieve faster chemotactic migration in denser environments. Controlled experiments reveal a non-monotonic relationship between chemotactic navigation speed and {\tau}_f, with the optimum shifting according to the density of physical traps in the gel. Single-cell analysis demonstrates that escape from these traps occurs independently of the tumbling mechanism, challenging the classical view that reorientation is essential for navigation in obstructed spaces. Based on these insights, we develop a minimal theoretical model showing that the optimal {\tau}_f emerges from an antagonistic scaling: while the diffusion coefficient increases with {\tau}_f, the chemotactic bias coefficient decreases with it. This work establishes a general principle for optimizing active transport through complex, disordered environments.</p>

These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in the Krylov superoperator subspace and can be analytically constructed given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs in Krylov space with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states. Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected value of $0.29$.</p>

            <h2>What is the signature of a trion in photoemission?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinyuan Wu, Zachary H. Withers, Thomas K. Allison, Diana Y. Qiu</p>
            <p>Recent advances in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) allow for the probing of multiparticle excited-states in reciprocal space. While neutral two-particle excitations (excitons) have been observed in tr-ARPES, signatures of trions -- three-quasiparticle bound states -- have only been probed via optical spectroscopy. Here, we develop a general theory for the ARPES signature of trions in the model system of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). We simulate the ARPES signals of both positively and negatively charged trions and show that the interaction of the residual holes, or electron and hole, lead to large energy shifts, on the order of the exciton binding energy, compared to the exciton signal. For positive trions, the additional momentum degree of freedom of the residual particles removes any strict lower bound on the photoemission energy, leading to distinctive asymmetric spectral features. For negative trions, the photoemission process causes the tr-ARPES spectrum to reproduce inverted images of the exciton band structure for multiple exciton states, encompassing both spin-allowed and spin-forbidden states, providing a direct momentum-resolved probe of both trion and exciton physics.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors based on electronic spins have emerged as powerful probes of microwave-frequency fields. Among other solid-state platforms, spins in molecular crystals offer a range of advantages, from high spin density to functionalization via chemical tunability. Here, we demonstrate microwave vector magnetometry using the photoexcited spin triplet of deuterated pentacene molecules, operating at zero external magnetic field and room temperature. We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of $1~\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. These results establish pentacene-based molecular spins as a practical and high-performance platform for microwave quantum sensing, and the control techniques are broadly applicable to other molecular and solid-state spin systems.</p>

            <h2>A First Look at Hydrogen Generation in an Ultramafic Rock with Micro-CT and SEM-BEX</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannah P. Menke, Zaid Z. Jangda, Max Webb, Jim Buckman, Amy Gough</p>
            <p>Natural hydrogen generated by water-rock interaction in ultramafic rocks is increasingly recognised as a potentially important primary energy resource, but the pore-scale processes that control the initiation and early transport of a free gas phase remain poorly constrained. Here we present an in situ X-ray micro-tomography experiment in which an ultramafic granular pack of dunnite from West Papua, Indonesia, saturated with KI-doped brine, is heated to 100C with a pore pressure of 4bar under 10bar confining pressure inside a micro-CT scanner. Time-resolved 4D imaging captures the transition from a fully liquid-saturated pore space to the appearance and growth of a distinct gas phase after an 8h induction period. Bubbles first nucleate near the top of the sample before becoming distributed throughout the imaged volume as a connected ganglia. The nucleating gas phase is most plausibly dominated by molecular hydrogen generated by low-temperature fluid-rock reaction, as indicated by independent hydrogen-presence detectors, although we cannot yet fully exclude minor contributions from other gases. SEM-BEX imaging reveals textural alteration and local changes in elemental signals between reacted and unreacted material. Taken together, these observations provide spatially and temporally resolved evidence for gas generation during low-temperature alteration of ultramafic grains and demonstrate that pore-scale imaging can directly link water-rock reaction kinetics, gas generation and multiphase flow behaviour in natural hydrogen systems.</p>

            <h2>Deriving the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis from Eigenstate Typicality and Kinematic Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yucheng Wang</p>
            <p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems, yet a complete and conceptually transparent derivation has remained elusive. In this work, we derive the structure of ETH from a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP), together with general kinematic ingredients arising from entropy maximization, Hilbert-space geometry, and locality. ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable, with respect to local measurements, from states drawn from the Haar measure on a narrow microcanonical shell. Within this framework, diagonal ETH arises from concentration of measure, provided that eigenstate typicality holds. The structure of off-diagonal matrix elements is then fixed by entropic scaling and the finite-time dynamical correlations of local observables, with ETP serving as the dynamical bridge to energy eigenstates, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, Hilbert-space geometry, and chaos-induced eigenstate typicality, and clarify its regime of validity across generic quantum-chaotic many-body systems, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew P. Leighton, Christopher W. Lynn</p>
            <p>Non-Markovian stochastic processes are ubiquitous in biology. Nevertheless, we lack a general framework for quantifying historical dependencies. In this Letter, we propose an information-theoretic approach to decompose history dependence in systems with non-Markovian dynamics, quantifying the information encoded in dependencies of each order. In minimal models of non-Markovian dynamics, we show that this framework correctly captures the underlying historical dependencies, even when autocorrelations do not. In prolonged recordings of fly behavior, we find that the scaling of non-Markovian dependencies is invariant across timescales from fractions of a second to minutes. Despite this invariance, the overall amount of non-Markovian information is non-monotonic, suggesting a unique timescale on which historical dependencies are strongest.</p>

            <h2>Pair-density-wave superconductivity and Anderson's theorem in bilayer nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanbit Oh, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.</p>

            <p>Fluid ferroelectrics, a recently discovered class of liquid crystals that exhibit switchable, long-range polar order, offer opportunities in ultrafast electro-optic technologies, responsive soft matter, and next-generation energy materials. Yet their discovery has relied almost entirely on intuition and chance, limiting progress in the field. Here we develop and experimentally validate a deep-learning data-to-molecule pipeline that enables the targeted design and synthesis of new organic fluid ferroelectrics. We curate a comprehensive dataset of all known longitudinally polar liquid-crystal materials and train graph neural networks that predict ferroelectric behaviour with up to 95% accuracy and achieve root mean square errors as low as 11 K for transition temperatures. A graph variational autoencoder generates de novo molecular structures which are filtered using an ensemble of high-performing classifiers and regressors to identify candidates with predicted ferroelectric nematic behaviour and accessible transition temperatures. Integration with a computational retrosynthesis engine and a digitised chemical inventory further narrows the design space to a synthesis-ready longlist. 11 candidates were synthesised and characterized through established mixture-based extrapolation methods. From which extrapolated ferroelectric nematic transitions were compared against neural network predictions. The experimental verification of novel materials augments the original dataset with quality feedback data thus aiding future research. These results demonstrate a practical, closed-loop approach to discovering synthesizable fluid ferroelectrics, marking a step toward autonomous design of functional soft materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wooil Yang, Iurii Timrov, Francesco Aquilante, Young-Woo Son</p>
            <p>Density-functional theory with on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$+$V$) is a powerful and accurate method for predicting various properties of transition-metal compounds. However, its accuracy depends critically on the values of these Hubbard parameters. Although they can be determined empirically, first-principles methods provide a more consistent and reliable approach; yet, their results can vary, and a comprehensive comparison between methods is still lacking. Here, we present a systematic comparison of two widely used approaches for computing $U$ and $V$, namely linear-response theory (LRT) and the Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism, applied to a representative set of oxides (MnO, NiO, CoO, FeO, BaTiO$_3$, ZnO, and ZrO$_2$). We find that for partially occupied transition-metal $d$ states, these two methods yield consistent $U$ values, but they differ for nearly empty or fully filled $d$ shells. For O-$2p$ states, LRT always predicts large $U$ values ($\sim$10 eV), whereas the pseudohybrid formalism produces system-dependent values depending on the level of localization and hybridization for the electronic states. Even larger differences are found for the inter-site $V$: the former predicts consistently small values ($<1$ eV), while the latter produces larger values ($\sim3$ eV), reflecting its explicit dependence on relative charge redistribution. Our results show that while parallels between these two methods exist, they rely on distinct assumptions for determining $U$ and $V$, leading to variations in predictions of material properties.</p>

            <h2>Anti-Correlated Noise in Epoch-Based Stochastic Gradient Descent: Implications for Weight Variances in Flat Directions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcel Kühn, Bernd Rosenow</p>
            <p>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone of neural network optimization due to its computational efficiency and generalization capabilities. However, the gradient noise introduced by SGD is often assumed to be uncorrelated over time, despite the common practice of epoch-based training where data is sampled without replacement. In this work, we challenge this assumption and investigate the effects of epoch-based noise correlations on the stationary distribution of discrete-time SGD with momentum. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we calculate the exact autocorrelation of the noise during epoch-based training under the assumption that the noise is independent of small fluctuations in the weight vector, revealing that SGD noise is inherently anti-correlated over time. Second, we explore the influence of these anti-correlations on the variance of weight fluctuations. We find that for directions with curvature of the loss greater than a hyperparameter-dependent crossover value, the conventional predictions of isotropic weight variance under stationarity, based on uncorrelated and curvature-proportional noise, are recovered. Anti-correlations have negligible effect here. However, for relatively flat directions, the weight variance is significantly reduced, leading to a considerable decrease in loss fluctuations compared to the constant weight variance assumption. Furthermore, we present a numerical experiment where training with these anti-correlations enhances test performance, suggesting that the inherent noise structure induced by epoch-based training may play a role in finding flatter minima that generalize better.</p>

            <p>Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a class of quantum error correction codes that contains the toric code and fracton models. A procedure called foliation defines a cluster state for a given CSS code. We use the CSS chain complex and its tensor product with other chain complexes to describe the topological structure in the foliated cluster state, and argue that it has a symmetry-protected topological order protected by generalized global symmetries supported on cycles in the foliated CSS chain complex. We demonstrate the so-called anomaly inflow between CSS codes and corresponding foliated cluster states by explicitly showing the equality of the gauge transformations of the bulk and boundary partition functions defined as functionals of defect world-volumes. We show that the bulk and boundary defects are related via measurement of the bulk system. Further, we provide a procedure to obtain statistical models associated with general CSS codes via the foliated cluster state, and derive a generalization of the Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality for such statistical models with insertion of twist defects. We also study the measurement-assisted gauging method with cluster-state entanglers for CSS/fracton models based on recent proposals in the literature, and demonstrate a non-invertible fusion of duality operators. Using the cluster-state entanglers, we construct the so-called strange correlator for general CSS/fracton models. Finally, we introduce a new family of subsystem-symmetric quantum models each of which is self-dual under the generalized Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality transformation, which becomes a non-invertible symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lluís Hernández-Navarro, Kenneth Distefano, Uwe C. Täuber, Mauro Mobilia</p>
            <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared drug protection. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile, spatially structured settings. Migration, space, fluctuations, and environmental variability all have a significant impact on the development and proliferation of AMR. While drug resistance is enhanced by migration in static conditions, this changes in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. Here, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment. This contains a toxin against which protection can be shared (cooperative AMR). Cells migrate between demes and connect them. When the environment and the deme composition vary on the same timescale, strong population bottlenecks cause fluctuation-driven extinction events, countered by migration. We investigate the influence of migration and environmental variability on the AMR eco-evolutionary dynamics by asking at what migration rate fluctuations can help clear resistance and what are the near-optimal environmental conditions ensuring the quasi-certain eradication of resistance in the shortest possible time. By combining analytical and computational tools, we answer these questions by determining when the resistant strain goes extinct across the entire metapopulation. While dispersal generally promotes strain coexistence, here we show that slow-but-nonzero migration can speed up and enhance resistance clearance, and determine the near-optimal conditions for this phenomenon. We discuss the impact of our findings on laboratory-controlled experiments and outline their generalisation to lattices of any spatial dimension.</p>

            <p>While the microscopic laws of physics are often symmetric under time reversal, most natural processes that we observe are not. The emergent asymmetry between typical and time-reversed processes is referred to as the arrow of time. In quantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is performed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield dynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control tools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can replicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such Hamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process, generate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time. It can also be used to simulate the backward-in-time dynamics of an open quantum system. Finally, we design a feedback-driven continuous measurement engine powered by the energy pumped into the system by the monitoring process. We show the engine can operate under experimentally realizable conditions with feedback delay and finite-efficiency measurements.</p>

            <p>The algebraic approach to quantum field theory focuses on the properties of local algebras, whereas the study of (possibly non-invertible) global symmetries emphasizes global aspects of the theory and spacetime. We study connections between these two perspectives by examining how either of two core algebraic properties -- "additivity" or "Haag duality" -- is violated in a 1+1D CFT or lattice model restricted to the symmetric sector of a general global symmetry. For the Verlinde symmetry of a bosonic diagonal RCFT, we find that additivity is violated whenever the symmetry algebra contains an invertible element, while Haag duality is violated whenever it contains a non-invertible element. We find similar phenomena for the Kramers-Wannier and Rep(D$_8$) non-invertible symmetries on spin chains.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO$_2$) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO$_2$ interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in Hahn-echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin relaxation with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Data-driven molecular discovery leverages artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) and generative modeling to filter and design novel molecules. Discovering novel molecules requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, but ML models struggle to generalize OOD. Currently, no systematic benchmarks exist for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present $\mathbf{BOOM}$, $\mathbf{b}$enchmarks for $\mathbf{o}$ut-$\mathbf{o}$f-distribution $\mathbf{m}$olecular property predictions: a chemically-informed benchmark for OOD performance on common molecular property prediction tasks. We evaluate over 150 model-task combinations to benchmark deep learning models on OOD performance. Overall, we find that no existing model achieves strong generalization across all tasks: even the top-performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x higher than in-distribution. Current chemical foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation, while models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. We perform extensive ablation experiments, highlighting how data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation impact OOD performance. Developing models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML. This open-source benchmark is available at this https URL</p>

            <p>We evaluate the conditions for surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space subjected to large deformations and a magnetic field. After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios.

            <p>The global symmetry data of a $D$-dimensional absolute quantum field theory can sometimes be packaged in terms of a $(D+1)$-dimensional bulk system obtained by extending along an interval, with a relative QFT$_D$ at one end and suitable gapped / free boundary conditions at the other end. The partition function of the QFT$_D$ can then be interpreted as a wavefunction depending on background fields. However, in some cases, it is not possible or simply cumbersome to fix an absolute form of the symmetry data. Additionally, it is also of interest to consider entangled and mixed states of relative QFTs as well as entangled and mixed states of gapped / free boundary conditions. We argue that Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function on phase space provides a physical interpretation of the symmetry data in all such situations. We illustrate these considerations in the case of string compactifications and holographic systems.</p>

            <p>Superfluorescence (SF) is the collective emission of intense, coherent light from an interacting ensemble of quantum emitters1-4. While SF has been observed in several solid-state materials5-8, the spontaneous generation of circularly polarized SF from chiral materials (chiral SF) has not been realized9,10. Here, we report the first observation of chiral SF originating from edge states in large-area (>100 um * 100 um) vertically aligned chiral perovskite superlattices at room-temperature. Theoretical quantum optics calculations describe the transition from initially unpolarized, incoherent spontaneous emission to a coherent chiral SF state, quantitatively reproducing both the experimentally observed generation of circular polarization (up to ~14%) and its reversal in sign with opposite material handedness. Moreover, we show that both the intensity and the degree of circular polarization of chiral SF can be modulated by a weak magnetic field, enabling precise control over solid-state quantum light emission at room temperature. Our findings demonstrate an interplay between chirality and many-body quantum coherence, thereby revealing promising new directions for chirality-controlled quantum-optical applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shrigyan Brahmachari, Austin Hulse, Henry D. Pfister, Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$ qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests, a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error $\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as quantum state tomography and metrology.</p>

            <p>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach to improve correctness in LLMs, however, in many scientific problems, the objective is not necessarily to produce the correct answer, but instead to produce a diverse array of candidates which satisfy a set of constraints. We study this challenge in the context of materials generation. To this end, we introduce PLaID++, an LLM post-trained for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We find that performance hinges on our crystallographic representation and reward formulation. First, we introduce a compact, symmetry-informed Wyckoff text representation which improves computational efficiency and encourages generalization from physical priors. Second, we demonstrate that temperature scaling acts as an entropy regularizer which counteracts mode collapse and encourages exploration. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group properties. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veronica Giardini, Luca Guariento, Andrea Fantini, Shawn Storm, Massimo Inguscio, Jacopo Catani, Giacomo Cappellini, Vladislav Gavryusev, Leonardo Fallani</p>
            <p>We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on a blue shielded magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 6.8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 $\mu$K and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(2)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ $\mu$K for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 min. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.</p>

            <h2>Swarming Lattice in Frustrated Vicsek-Kuramoto Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yichen Lu, Yingshan Guo, Yiyi Zhang, Tong Zhu, Zhigang Zheng</p>
            <p>We introduce a frustration parameter $\alpha$ into the Vicsek-Kuramoto systems of self-propelled particles. While the system exhibits conventional synchronized states, such as global phase synchronization and swarming, for low frustration ($\alpha < \pi/2$), beyond the critical point $\alpha = \pi/2$, a Hopf-Turing bifurcation drives a transition to a resting hexagonal lattice, accompanied by spatiotemporal patterns such as vortex lattices and dual-cluster lattices with oscillatory unit-cell motions. Lattice dominance is governed by coupling strength and interaction radius, with a clear parametric boundary balancing pattern periodicity and particle dynamics. Our results demonstrate that purely orientational interactions are sufficient to form symmetric lattices, challenging the necessity of spatial forces and illuminating the mechanisms driving lattice formation in active matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Universal Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation for Quantum $f-$Divergences</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domingos S. P. Salazar</p>
            <p>We show that any Petz $f$-divergence (where $f$ is operator convex) between quantum states admits a universal $\chi^2$-mixture representation: the distinguishability of $\rho$ from $\sigma$ is obtained as a positive superposition of quadratic contrasts $\chi^2_\lambda$, with nonnegative weights $w_f(\lambda)$ determined explicitly from the Stieltjes representation of the generator $f$. This identifies $\chi^2_\lambda$ as atomic building blocks for quantum $f$-divergences and yields closed-form $w_f$ for canonical choices (relative entropy/KL, Hellinger/Bures, R'{e}nyi). By mapping $\chi^2_\lambda$ into a classical Pearson $\chi^2$, we leverage the Chapman-Robbins variational representation and obtain a tight and universal quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation: any $f$-divergence is lower bounded by a function of the statistics of quantum observables (mean and variance), reproducing previous and novel results in quantum thermodynamics as applications.</p>

            <h2>Generalizing fusion rules by shuffle: Symmetry-based classifications of nonlocal systems constructed from similarity transformations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshiki Fukusumi, Taishi Kawamoto</p>
            <p>We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</p>

            <p>We discuss the quantum geometric contribution to the diffusion constant and the DC conductivity in metals and semimetals with linear Dirac dispersion. We demonstrate that, for systems with perfectly linear dispersion, there exists a clear and rigorous separation of the quantum geometric from the ordinary band velocity contributions to the diffusion constant, which turns out to be directly related to the separation of a rank two tensor into transverse and longitudinal parts. We also demonstrate that the diffusion constant of three-dimensional Dirac fermions at charge neutrality is entirely quantum geometric in origin, which is not the case for two-dimensional Dirac fermions. This is the result of an accidental perfect cancellation of the band velocity contribution in three dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Kondo Effect in Strained Kagome Nanoribbons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patricia A Almeida, George B Martins, Sergio Ulloa</p>
            <p>Metallic kagome systems have attracted considerable interest in recent years, as they provide a rich platform for studying phenomena associated with their distinctive band structure. The coexistence of bands with Dirac points similar to those in graphene, along with a completely flat band, makes this an ideal structure for investigating how lattice symmetries may protect topological and many-body correlation effects. Since applied strain can break lattice symmetries and modify the electronic structure, understanding how strain influences phenomena such as the Kondo effect in kagome materials may provide essential insights into correlated-electron behavior. We employ the single-impurity Anderson model and the numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in kagome zigzag nanoribbons under uniaxial strain. We find that strain manipulation enables precise control over the strength of the Kondo effect on an impurity hybridized on the ribbon with different coordination environments, and that symmetric local environments may result in strong suppression of the effective hybridization due to orbital interference. We find that the specific location of the impurity on the ribbon, especially when the Fermi energy lies close to weakly dispersive edge states, can lead to significant changes in the characteristic Kondo temperature. Such sensitivity may be used to provide unique information on the local density of states of a system. These results demonstrate that strain is a powerful tuning parameter in kagome nanoribbons, strongly modifying the screening of magnetic impurities.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions (JJs), devices consisting of two superconductors separated by a barrier, are of great technological importance, being a cornerstone of quantum information processing. Classical understanding of superconductor-insulator-superconductor JJs is that conventional insulator's properties, other than magnetism, do not significantly influence the junction's behavior. However, recent work on quantum material (QM) JJs - using Mott insulator Nb3Br8 - resulted in magnetic field-free non-reciprocal superconductivity, termed the Josephson diode effect (JDE), implying the QM's intrinsic properties can modulate superconductivity in non-trivial ways. To date, the underlying mechanism and dependence of the JDE on correlation strength (U/t) has not been elucidated. Here we fabricate QMJJs using correlated Kagome insulators with varying U/t, Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I), observing a decreasing trend of the field-free JDE with Nb3Cl8 reaching ~48% efficiency, Nb3Br8 ~6%, and Nb3I8 having no discernible JDE, matching the trend of decreasing U/t from Cl to I and suggesting correlation in insulators drives the field-free JDE.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamalesh Bera, Tanay Nag, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical investigation of the emergence of chiral topological superconductivity in small-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG). Using the low-energy continuum model and incorporating spin-triplet $p_{x}+i p_{y}$ pairing in each graphene layer, we construct the effective models for both tBLG and tDBLG with superconductivity. By varying the chemical potential, superconducting order parameter, and twist angle, we explore the emergence of topological superconducting phases via the calculation of Chern numbers. Our phase diagrams for tBLG and tDBLG (both AB-AB and AB-BA stackings) reveal distinct topological transitions, which are consistently marked by bulk gap-closing points. To gain further insight, we analyze the evolution of Chern numbers by tracking the number and location of gap closings within the moiré Brillouin zone. Additionally, we illustrate representative squared amplitude of Bloch states corresponding to different topological phases. In the later part of our study, the effect of trigonal warping on the topological superconducting properties is also discussed. Beyond the quantitative results, our study highlights how the interplay between moiré band structure and unconventional pairing symmetries enriches the landscape of possible superconducting states in twisted graphene systems. The framework developed here may also be extended to other multilayer moiré materials, offering a route towards engineering exotic topological superconductivity with tunable parameters.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism (AM) has brought renewed attention to the Lieb lattice. Here, we broaden the scope of altermagnetic models on the Lieb lattice by using a general scheme based on spin clusters. We design various altermagnetic models with d- and g-wave on the Lieb lattice, and investigate its interplay with spin-orbit coupling. While the altermagnetic unit cell reconstructs the topological edge states in the strip geometry and leads to the emergence of Dirac points, the in-plane magnetic moments of AM can induce gaps at these points. In an open square geometry, corner modes emerge within these gaps, realizing higher-order topological states. We further verify that the induction of higher-order topology is applicable to all altermagnetic configurations constructed here on the Lieb lattice, and is most pronounced for AM by comparing with the other types of magnetism such as ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism. Our results highlight the exotic properties of AM, and suggest its potential applications in engineering topological quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Multipoles as quantitative order parameters for altermagnetic spin splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Martinelli, Anouk Droux, Claude Ederer</p>
            <p>We establish a quantitative relation between the altermagnetic spin-splitting and different higher order multipoles of the charge and magnetization density around the magnetic atoms. Magnetic multipoles such as octupoles or triakontadipoles have been suggested as potential ferroic order parameters for d- and g-wave altermagnetism, respectively, based mainly on qualitative symmetry arguments. We use first-principles-based electronic structure calculations to establish a clear quantitative relation between the strength of the altermagnetic spin splitting and the magnitude of certain local multipoles. We vary the magnitude of these multipoles either by applying an appropriate constraint on the charge density or by varying a corresponding structural distortion mode, using two simple perovskite materials, SrCrO3 and LaVO3, as model systems. Our analysis indicates that in general the altermagnetic spin splitting is not exclusively determined by the lowest order nonzero magnetic multipole, but results from a superposition of contributions from different multipoles with comparable strength, suggesting the need for a multi-component order parameter to describe altermagnetism. We also discuss different measures to quantify the overall spin-splitting of a material, without relying on features that might be specific to only individual bands.</p>

            <h2>Fractionalized topological d+id superconductivity in the Yao-Lee-Kondo model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengzhi Tang, Hong Yao</p>
            <p>A conclusive experimental realization of 2D chiral topological superconductivity remains elusive. Here we present a theoretical demonstration that a topological $d+id$ fractionalized superconducting phase (SC*) can emerge in the weak-coupling limit of a Kondo lattice model, where conduction electrons interact with a Yao-Lee spin liquid on the honeycomb lattice (the Yao-Lee-Kondo model). Using a renormalization-group analysis, we show that exchanging Majorana spinons from the Yao-Lee spin liquid generates effective interactions among the conduction electrons and drives a Cooper instability even for arbitrarily weak Kondo coupling. We further find that the induced leading inter-orbital antiferromagnetic interaction selects topological $d+id$ spin-singlet pairing with Chern number $C=\pm 2$. Meanwhile, the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee spin liquid remain gapless and deconfined in this regime, so the resulting state is a fractionalized topological $d+id$ superconductor (SC*). For sufficiently strong Kondo coupling, the system instead enters a heavy Fermi liquid phase with fractionalization (HFL*).</p>

Recent advances in controlling light-matter systems have opened new avenues to explore non-Hermitian effects arising from dissipative coupling, such as level attraction and anomalous dispersions. In this work, we perform a parametric study of these effects in a polariton system, i.e., a light-matter superposition, under both dissipative and coherent coupling. We characterize the effects of different sources of non-Hermitian behavior and analytically identify the conditions for the emergence of negative effective mass, exceptional points, and bound states in the continuum as a function of the light-matter detuning, the coherent-to-dissipative coupling ratio, and the relative decay rate of the non-interacting subsystems. We also analyze the classical limit of the polariton system within a non-Hermitian framework, employing coherent states.</p>

            <p>By analyzing the spin-group symmetry of magnons, we establish two generalized Onsager's relations in the magnon thermal Hall effect, which reveals the rich and complicated structures of the magnon Berry curvature in the parameter space of different types of the exchange coupling. As an important consequence, we find that the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the planar magnon thermal Hall effect without the DM interaction. This removes the local inversion-symmetry-breaking condition for generating the magnon thermal Hall effect. Moreover, we predict an exotic phenomenon that the thermal conductivity exhibits angular dependence with respect to the in-plane magnetization. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions.</p>

In this article, we investigate the quantum geometric contribution to the phonon spectrum in the absence of Holstein phonons. Using graphene as a case study, we decompose the dynamical matrix into distinct terms that exhibit different dependencies on the electron energy and wavefunction. We then examine the role of quantum geometry in shaping the material's phonon spectrum, and we find that removing the nontrivial quantum geometric contribution from the dynamical matrix causes the acoustic phonon modes to behave in a non-analytic fashion.</p>

            <p>The ubiquitous tendency of superconducting cuprates to form charge density waves (CDWs) has reignited interest in the nature of their electron-phonon interaction and its role in shaping their phase diagrams. While pronounced dispersion anomalies were reported in several phonon branches, their precise connection to charge order and superconductivity remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering under low temperature and high magnetic field, we uncover a striking phonon renormalization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. It appears along a reciprocal space trajectory connecting the wave vectors of a short-range 2D-CDW, emerging above the superconducting transition, and a long-range 3D-CDW, appearing only when superconductivity is strongly suppressed. The spectral changes are strongest around the wave vector of the 3D-CDW despite the fact that it is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge conventional phonon self-energy renormalization models, instead support a scenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive CDW excitations and provide insights into the interplay between lattice vibrations and electronic correlations in high-temperature superconductors.</p>

In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension.

            <p>The spectrum of Markov generators encodes physical information beyond simple decay and oscillation, which reflects irreversibility and governs the structure of correlation functions. In this work, we prove an ellipse theorem that provides a universal thermodynamic geometric constraint on the spectrum of Markov rate matrices. The theorem states that all eigenvalues lie within a specific ellipse in the complex plane. In particular, the imaginary parts of the spectrum, which indicate oscillatory modes, are bounded by the maximum thermodynamic force associated with individual transitions. This spectral bound further constrains the initial short-time behavior of correlation functions between two arbitrary observables. Finally, we compare our result with a previously proposed conjecture, which remains an open problem and warrants further investigation.</p>

            <h2>Hidden ferromagnetism of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. V. Solovyev</p>
            <p>The time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) breaking is a signature of ferromagnetism, giving rise to such phenomena as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and orbital magnetism. Nevertheless, $\mathcal{T}$ can be also broken in certain classes of antiferromagnets, such as weak ferromagnets or altermagnets, which remain invariant under the spatial inversion. In the light of this similarity with the ferromagnetism, it is tempting to ask whether such unconventional antiferromagnetic (AFM) state can be presented as a simplest ferromagnetic one, i.e. within the unit cell containing only one magnetic site. We show that such presentation is possible due to special form of the spin-orbit (SO) interaction in an antiferroelectrically distorted lattice hosting this AFM state. The inversion symmetry constrains the form of the SO interaction, which becomes invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}| {\bf t} \}$, combining the $180^{\circ}$ rotation of spins ($\mathcal{S}$) with the lattice shift ${\bf t}$, connecting two antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices. This is the fundamental symmetry property of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets, which justifies the use of the generalized Bloch theorem and transformation to the local coordinate frame with one magnetic site per cell. It naturally explains the emergence of AHE and net orbital magnetization, and provide transparent expressions for these properties in terms of the electron hoppings and SO interaction operating between AFM sublattices, as well as the orthorhombic strain, controlling the piezomagnetic response. The idea is illustrated on a number of examples including two-dimensional square lattice, monoclinic VF$_4$ and CuF$_2$, and RuO$_2$-type materials with the rutile structure, using for these purposes realistic models derived from first-principles calculations.</p>

            <p>We develop an experimental double-model analysis, combined with density-functional theory (DFT), to investigate the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) associated with the electron-capture (EC) decay ``aftereffects'' (ECAE) phenomenon. This electronic phenomenon, which is reversible with temperature, is typically observed in TDPAC experiments on oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC) $\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd probe atoms and was recently explained within an \emph{ab initio} framework based on fluctuations in the number of trapped electron holes at ^{111}$Cd [Phys. Rev. B $\bf{105}$, 195201 (2022)]. From now on, it is possible to determine, for each measured temperature and observed HFI, the set of \emph{initial} electronic configurations around the probe nucleus and their associated EFGs, whose fluctuations produce these dynamic HFIs, rather than simply identifying the configuration that generates the stable final EFG when the dynamic process ends. We demonstrate the equivalence between the two most used methods for analyzing this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by Bäverstam \emph{et al.} (BO approach) and Lupascu \emph{et al.} (L approach), successfully connecting the relaxation constant $\lambda$$_r$ (the damping strength of the TDPAC spectra) in the BO approach with the distribution's half-width $\delta$$_i$ of the initial fluctuating EFGs in the L approach. To address this, we perform a comprehensive DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed \emph{ab initio} analysis of defect-formation energies, both as a function of the Cd impurity's charge state, to unravel controversial TDPAC results reported for ^{111}$In-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals, now revisited. These results quantitatively confirm the physical scenario underlying both the BO and L approaches, and this new method can also be applied to other TDPAC probes without EC.</p>

            <p>Human skin oils are a major sink for ozone in densely occupied indoor environments. Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water -- two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound -- through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through a propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility, and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about one order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure and indoor air quality.</p>

            <p>The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping, implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems.</p>

            <h2>Photoemission tomography of excitons in 2D systems: momentum-space signatures of correlated electron-hole wave functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siegfried Kaidisch, Amir Kleiner, Sivan Refaely-Abramson, Peter Puschnig, Christian S. Kern</p>
            <p>The momentum-space signatures of excitons can be experimentally accessed through time-resolved (pump-probe) photoelectron spectroscopy. In this work, we develop a computational framework for exciton photoemission orbital tomography (exPOT) in periodic systems, enabling the simulation and interpretation of experimental observables within many-body perturbation theory. By connecting the GW +Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach to photoemission tomography, our formalism captures exciton photoemission in periodic systems, explicitly incorporating photoemission matrix element effects induced by the light-matter interaction via the probe pulse. The correlated nature of electrons and holes introduces distinct consequences for excitonic photoemission. Using the prototypical two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride, we demonstrate these effects, including a dependence of the photoemission angular distribution on the pump pulse polarization. Moreover, our framework extends to excitons with finite center-of-mass momentum, making it well-suited to studying momentum-dark excitons. This provides valuable insights into the microscopic nature of excitonic phenomena in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Functional renormalization with interaction flows: A single-boson exchange perspective and application to electron-phonon systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiman Al-Eryani, Marcel Gievers, Kilian Fraboulet</p>
            <p>The functional renormalization group (fRG) is acknowledged as a powerful tool in quantum many-body physics and beyond. On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is an extension of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting spintronics with electron symmetry filtering and interfacial spin-orbit coupling</h2>

            <p>Over the recent years, crossroads of magnetism and superconductivity led to the emerging field of superconducting spintronics. A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities.</p>

            <p>Electronic properties of silicon-based clathrates can be tuned by boron incorporation into the silicon cage network. Sodium borosilicides clathrate outstands with uncommon stoichiometry and expected metallic properties, in contrast to other alkali metal semiconductive Zintl borosilicides. In this study, we report an experimental investigation of the high-pressure behavior of type-I and type-VIII sodium borosilicide clathrates. An isostructural phase transition, marked by an abrupt volume collapse at 13 GPa, is observed exclusively in type-I sodium borosilicide clathrates. This transition is attributed to the pressure-induced diffusion of silicon atoms from the Si(6c) site. This mechanism provides the first experimental validation of a transition predicted theoretically for this class of materials. Isostructural phase transitions were only observed in type-I borosilicide. In contrast, the type-VIII borosilicide phase exhibits conventional elastic compression. The metallic character was established using reflectance spectroscopy over a wide energy range, in good agreement with crystallographic data on the boron content.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuchen Li, Chang Niu, Peide D. Ye, Axel Hoffmann</p>
            <p>Materials with broken fundamental symmetries, such as chiral crystals, provide a rich playground for exploring unconventional spin-dependent transport phenomena. The interplay between a material's chirality, strong spin-orbit coupling, and charge currents can lead to complex non-reciprocal effects, where electrical resistance depends on the direction of current and magnetic fields. In this study, we systematically investigate the angular dependencies of magnetoresistance in single-crystalline chiral Tellurium (Te). We observe distinct non-reciprocal magnetoresistances for magnetic fields applied along three orthogonal directions: parallel to the current along the chiral axis (z), in the sample plane but perpendicular to the current (y), and out of the sample plane (x). Through detailed analysis of the chirality- and thickness-dependence of the signals, we successfully disentangle multiple coexisting mechanisms. We conclude that the Edelstein effect, arising from the chiral structure's radial spin texture, is responsible for the non-reciprocity along the z-axis. In contrast, the chirality-independent signal along the y-axis is attributed to the Nernst effect, and the non-reciprocity along the x-axis may originate from intrinsic orbital magnetizations. These findings elucidate the complex interplay of spin, orbital, and thermal effects in Te, providing a complete picture of its non-reciprocal transport properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kanchan Meena, Souvik Ghosh, P. Singha Deo</p>
            <p>In a series of recent papers we have proved rigorously that time travel is a reality and very much feasible by using quantum mechanical processes. There are plenty of indirect experimental support untill a direct experiment is conducted. The process crucially depend on the reality of a local time as well as a local partial density of states (LPDOS) that can become negative very easily in the quantum regime of mesoscopic systems. Mesoscopic systems are small enough to allow us to experimentally access the intermediate regime between the classical and quantum worlds. This LPDOS is in every sense a hidden variable in quantum mechanics that does not show up in the axiomatic framework of quantum mechanics. It can be inferred through physical clocks obeying quantum dynamics and can be rigorously justified from the properties of the Hilbert space that is uniquely isomorphic to the complex plane. Therefore one can naturally guess that LPDOS will have something important to say about quantum measurement as well as the unification of classical and quantum laws. We therefore undertake the exercise to show that LPDOS can very much allow us to re-interpret the enormously successful phenomenological Landauer-Buttiker formalism for mesoscopic systems and put it on firm theoretical ground as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, thereby unifying them. Essentially the local time calculated quantum mechanically can dilate exactly like the proper time of relativity and be consistent with the coordinate time of relativity. Also the measured conductance of mesoscopic samples is a deterministic quantum measurement outcome from a linear superposition of states, essentially because of LPDOS, which solves the quantum measurement problem. For this we analyze the three probe conductance formula in details and give our arguments for the general case.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</p>

            <p>Reproducibility and quantization in quantum spin Hall platforms is a persisting challenge, limiting their use in hybrid realizations of topological superconductivity. We report robust and reproducible quantized transport in a graphene quantum Hall topological insulator, stabilized at low magnetic fields by screening long-range Coulomb interactions with a metallic Bi$_2$Se$_3$ back gate. Beyond quantized resistance plateaus, we demonstrate mode-resolved control via gate-defined chiral-helical junctions that selectively transmit or backscatter a single helical channel, a capability inaccessible in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall systems. Targeted experiments and simulations identify contact-induced doping, effectively creating unintended chiral-helical interfaces, as a generic mechanism for quantization breakdown, which is mitigated by large area contacts that enhance edge-channel equilibration. Our findings establish metal screened graphene as a gate-tunable, interaction-driven helical system with quantized transport, spatially separable helical channels, and compatibility with superconducting proximity for topological devices.</p>

            <h2>Finite-temperature quantum rotor approach for ultracold bosons in optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Rodríguez Martín, T. A. Zaleski</p>
            <p>Interacting bosons in optical lattices directly expose quantum phases in a clean, highly controllable environment. This requires engineering systems with very low entropies, but the resulting temperature--interaction ratios $T/U$ of present experiments remain well above the domain where zero-temperature theories are expected to be reliable. The quantum-rotor approach (QRA), while analytically powerful and extremely flexible, inherits ground-state phase correlations and therefore breaks down once thermal winding of the phase field becomes significant. Here we construct a finite-temperature extension of QRA by (i) performing resummation of winding-number contributions for temperatures $k_{B}T/U\lesssim 0.2$ and (ii) developing an auxiliary-variable expansion that remains accurate toward the classical limit. The resulting closed expression for the phase correlator is inserted into the standard spherical-approximation QRA without sacrificing the method's flexibility with respect to lattice geometry and dimensionality. The approach reproduces the shrinkage of Mott lobes from $T=0$ up to $k_{B}T/U\simeq 0.2$ in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and with in-situ imaging experiments. This finite-T QRA thus supplies an analytic, computationally light tool for strongly correlated lattice bosons and sets the stage for amplitude-fluctuation upgrades required at higher temperatures.</p>

            <p>FeSe stands out among iron-based superconductors due to its extended nematic phase without the onset of long-range magnetic order. While strain-dependent electrical resistivity has been extensively explored to probe nematicity, its influence on magneto-transport properties remains less understood. In this work, we present measurements of the magneto-elasto-resistivity in FeSe as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Using a minimal multiband Boltzmann model for transport we derive analytical expressions that capture the magnetic behavior of the whole set of experimental data both in the paramagnetic and in the nematic phase. These findings indicate that a multiband framework can robustly describe the magneto-elasto-transport properties in FeSe and arguably in other iron-based superconductors.</p>

We prove reversibility of the resulting scheme and demonstrate its performance on several numerical examples, observing a substantial performance increase compared to methods based on overdamped Langevin dynamics as considered previously. Advances in generative machine-learning-based proposal samplers now enable efficient sampling in CV spaces of intermediate dimensionality (tens to hundreds of variables), and our results extend their applicability toward more realistic molecular systems.</p>

            <p>We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.</p>

            <h2>Simulation of a rapid qubit readout dependent on the transmission of a single fluxon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Waltraut Wustmann, Kevin D. Osborn</p>
            <p>The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\leq 0.1\%$.</p>

While spectrally truncated three-dimensional Euler flows reach a stationary equilibrium state, they exhibit non-trivial temporal correlations. We show that these non-trivial correlations persist for small but finite viscosity, yielding an emergent $\tau\sim k^{-1}$ dynamical scaling, where $\tau$ is the decorrelation time. We characterise the crossover from the scaling $\tau\sim 1/(\nu k^2)$, expected at large viscosity, to the scaling $\tau\sim 1/(u_{\rm rms}k)$ found in the inviscid limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hrvoje Vrcan, Johan H. Mentink</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ansätze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Focusing on the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We provide evidence that the nature of the instability stems from stiffness of the dynamics of the variational parameters, despite the absence of stiffness in the exact quantum dynamics. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.</p>

            <p>We derive a quantum extension of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation where dynamical fluctuations are quantified by the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill quasiprobability, a quantum generalization of the classical joint probability. The obtained inequality plays a complementary role to existing quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations, focusing on observables' change rather than exchange of charges through jumps and respecting initial coherence. Quasiprobabilities show anomalous behaviors that are forbidden in classical systems, such as negativity; we reveal that negativity or a non-classically enhanced escape rate is necessary to increase an output-to-dissipation ratio beyond classical limitations and show that the requirements are basis-independent and stronger than quantum coherence. To illustrate these statements, we employ a model that can exhibit a dissipationless heat current, which would be prohibited in classical systems; we construct a state that has much coherence but does not lead to a dissipationless current due to the absence of anomalous behaviors in quasiprobabilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiran Babasaheb Estake, T. R. Vishnu, Dibyendu Roy</p>
            <p>We propose a Hermitian quadratic bosonic model (QBH) whose dynamical matrix exhibits distinct topological and dynamical phenomena depending on whether the hopping and pairing amplitudes are real or purely imaginary. In the real-parameter regime, the dynamical matrix is unitarily equivalent to four decoupled copies of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH2) model, thereby inheriting its topological phases and energy spectrum-including the Möbius phase, a gapless topological phase with fractional winding number, having no Hermitian counterpart. We show that the dynamics generated by the QBH Hamiltonian naturally reproduce non-Hermitian time evolution, without invoking nonlinear Schrödinger dynamics or ad hoc normalization. It is demonstrated by analytically calculating the Loschmidt amplitude and computing the dynamical topological order parameter under periodic boundary conditions, which displays a distinct chiral response in the Möbius phase. In contrast, when the hopping and pairing terms are taken to be purely imaginary, the dynamical matrix becomes unitarily equivalent to a different version of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH1) model that supports only two topological phases: trivial and non-trivial, and the Möbius phase disappears. The latter system exhibits sublattice-dependent chiral amplification under open boundary conditions. We show that this amplification arises from the non-trivial topology of the dynamical matrix, establishing a clear link between topological phase and amplification behavior in the imaginary-parameter regime.</p>

            <p>We study chaotic many-body quantum dynamics in a minimal model with spatial structure and local interactions. It has a time-independent Hamiltonian, in contrast to quantum circuits and Brownian models, and is simple at the single-site level, in contrast to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev chains. It is analytically tractable for large local Hilbert space dimension and weak intersite coupling. In this limit we show that energy dynamics is described by a classical master equation and is diffusive. We also show that the spectral form factor can be expressed exactly in terms of the solution to this master equation. For a two-site system we obtain closed-form expressions for both the two-point correlator of energy density and the spectral form factor, in essentially perfect agreement with numerical simulations. For an $L$-site system we show at late times how a linear ramp emerges in the spectral form factor, as universally expected from level repulsion in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, at earlier times we identify two distinct mechanisms for an increase of the spectral form factor above its ramp value. One of these is associated with energy diffusion and is effective until the Thouless time, which varies as $L^2$. The other involves contributions like those that would appear if the system were composed of many uncoupled subsystems: they generate a large enhancement of the spectral form factor, and are suppressed on a timescale varying as $(\ln L)^2$. Besides being exact for the limit considered, we believe our approach provides the natural approximation even for small local Hilbert space dimension and strong intersite coupling. We present a numerical study of a spin-half chain, finding an early-time enhancement of the spectral form factor which is qualitatively similar to that in our solvable model.</p>

            <p>Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations of fermions has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.</p>

            <p>Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical state-vector simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to ${6\times 6}$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including different on-site electron-electron interaction strengths and magnetic flux values, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons (charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation), dynamical symmetry-breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled background state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that meaningful programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now feasible on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on Surfaces of Variable Negative Curvature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khushi Banthia, Rickmoy Samanta</p>
            <p>We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</p>

            <h2>Local spreading of stabilizer Rényi entropy in a brickwork random Clifford circuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Somnath Maity, Ryusuke Hamazaki</p>
            <p>Nonstabilizerness, or magic, constitutes a fundamental resource for quantum computation and a crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading.</p>

            <h2>Spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single-cavity spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kashif Ammar Yasir, Gao Xianlong</p>
            <p>Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Binze Tang, Chon-Hei Lo, Tiancheng Liang, Jiani Hong, Mian Qin, Yizhi Song, Duanyun Cao, Ying Jiang, Limei Xu</p>
            <p>Premelting plays a key role across physics, chemistry, materials and biology sciences but remains poorly understood at the atomic level due to surface characterization limitations. We report the discovery of a novel amorphous ice layer (AIL) preceding the quasi-liquid layer (QLL) during ice premelting, enabled by a machine learning framework integrating atomic force microscopy (AFM) with molecular dynamics simulations. This approach overcomes AFM's depth and signal limitations, allowing for three-dimensional surface structure reconstruction from AFM images. It further enables structural exploration of premelting interfaces across a wide temperature range that are experimentally inaccessible. We identify the AIL, present between 121-180K, displaying disordered two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network with solid-like dynamics. Our findings refine the ice premelting phase diagram and offering new insights into the surface growth dynamic, dissolution and interfacial chemical reactivity. Methodologically, this work establishes a novel framework for AFM-based 3D structural discovery, marking a significant leap in our ability to probe complex disordered interfaces with unprecedented precision and paving the way for future disciplinary research, including surface reconstruction, crystallization, ion solvation, and biomolecular recognition.</p>

            <h2>Localization from Infinitesimal Kinetic Grading: Critical Scaling and Kibble-Zurek Universality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Argha Debnath, Ayan Sahoo, Debraj Rakshit</p>
            <p>We study a one-dimensional lattice model with site-dependent nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes that follow a power-law profile. The hopping variation is controlled by a grading exponent, $\alpha$, which serves as the tuning parameter of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, the ground state becomes localized as $|\alpha| \to 0$, signaling the presence of a critical point characterized by a diverging localization length. Using exact diagonalization, we perform finite-size scaling analysis and extract the associated critical exponent governing this divergence, revealing a universality class distinct from well-known Anderson, Aubry-Andre, and Stark localization. To further characterize the critical behavior, we analyze the inverse participation ratio, the energy gap between the ground and first excited states, and the fidelity susceptibility. We also investigate nonequilibrium dynamics by linearly ramping the hopping profile at various rates and tracking the evolution of the localization length and the inverse participation ratio. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism successfully captures the resulting dynamics using the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. Our results demonstrate a clean, disorder-free route to localization and provide a tunable platform relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atom arrays with engineered hopping profiles.</p>

            <p>We investigate electronic transport through gate-defined quantum dots in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ using an integrated charge detector. We observe a crossover from two weakly coupled single dots to a strongly coupled double quantum dot. In the regime of extremely weak dot-lead coupling, where the direct transport current is below the detection limit, we measure the dot occupation via charge detection and access the few-electron regime. Due to the large band gap of MoS$_2$, tunneling rates can be sufficiently suppressed to resolve individual tunneling events. These results establish a platform for single-shot spin- and valley-to-charge conversion and highlight the potential of transition-metal dichalcogenide quantum dots for quantum information applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal Zimmerman, Daniel Podolsky, Ronen Rapaport, Snir Gazit</p>
            <p>Recent experiments on trilayer transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures have revealed the rich behavior of dipolar excitons. Motivated by these experimental observations, we investigate the collective dynamics of planar quantum dipoles whose orientation fluctuates due to charge tunneling between the outer layers. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the low-temperature phase diagram as a function of experimentally tunable parameters. We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges. Suppressing charge tunneling nucleates a droplet state stabilized by the attractive interaction between antiparallel dipoles. At high exciton densities, the system gives way to a partially fragmented condensate, characterized by competing quadrupolar and dipolar superfluid states. Furthermore, at a large exciton mass and high density, we find a staggered dipolar crystal. Our detailed study of the dependence of exciton energy shifts on an external electric field directly interprets existing experimental data and underscores the crucial role of the antiparallel dipolar configuration. Our results provide a guide for future experimental explorations of quantum phases of trilayer excitons.</p>

            <h2>Anyon Dispersion in Aharonov-Casher Bands and Implications for Twisted MoTe${}_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihan Yan, Qingchen Li, Tomohiro Soejima, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in two-dimensional heterostructures has opened the door to realizing phases of dispersing anyons. Here, we develop an analytically controlled theory of anyon dispersion in FQAH states realized in ideal or Aharonov-Casher (AC) bands by projecting interactions onto the space of Laughlin quasiholes. Constructing quasihole momentum eigenstates allows efficient evaluation of the single quasihole dispersion using Monte Carlo. We find that the quasihole bandwidth grows with increasing quantum-geometry inhomogeneity of the AC band and with increasing interaction screening length. For realistic parameters relevant to the bands of twisted MoTe${}_2$, the quasihole bandwidth is of order 1 meV, suggesting that itinerant-anyon physics may play an important role in sufficiently clean samples. Furthermore, we develop a microscopic Lagrangian framework in terms of a quasihole guiding-center coordinate, which reproduces the momentum-space formula for the dispersion. This approach reveals that quasihole dispersion originates from the combined effects of an interaction-generated periodic potential, arising from non-uniform quantum geometry of the single particle bands, and the quasihole many-body Berry phase arising from the background magnetic field. The latter endows the guiding-center coordinate with a noncommutative structure, converting the periodic potential into a finite dispersion. Finally, we outline how this framework generalizes to multiple quasiholes, enabling a microscopic theory of charged excitations in FQAH systems that retains only the anyon degrees of freedom.</p>

            <h2>Classifying one-dimensional Floquet phases through two-dimensional topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Campbell McLauchlan, Vedant Motamarri, Benjamin Béri</p>
            <p>Floquet systems display rich phenomena, such as time crystals, with many-body localisation (MBL) protecting the phases from heating. While several types of Floquet phases have been classified, a unified picture of Floquet MBL is still emerging. Static phases have been fruitfully studied via "symmetry topological field theory" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as "dual" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss. Our results show that SymTFT provides a powerful approach to unifying phases and features of Floquet systems.</p>

            <p>Fractional quantum Hall states host emergent anyons with exotic exchange statistics, but obtaining direct access to their topological properties in real systems remains a challenge. Neural-network wavefunctions provide a flexible computational approach, as they can represent highly correlated states without requiring a tailored basis. Here we use the neural-network variational Monte Carlo method to study the fractional quantum Hall effect on the torus and find the three degenerate ground states at filling factor nu=1/3. From these, we extract the modular S matrix via entanglement interferometry, a technique previously only applied to lattice models. The resulting S matrix encodes the quantum dimensions, fusion rules, and exchange statistics of the emergent anyons, providing a direct numerical demonstration of the topological order. The calculated anyon properties match the well-known theoretical and experimental results. Our work establishes neural-network wavefunctions as a powerful new tool for investigating anyonic properties.</p>

            <p>We calculate the edge current and its fluctuations, i.e. noise, in a 2D topological superconductor using the T-matrix and the Green function techniques. We show that the current is zero for non-chiral edge states and non-zero for chiral edge states, while the edge noise is non-zero whatever the chirality of the edge states. By applying our results to toy models with chiral edge states, we find that the noise is closely related to the Chern number. The edge noise is non-zero only when the Chern number is non-zero, and the bulk noise exhibits a peak each time the Chern number varies, meaning that there is strong current fluctuations when a topological phase transition occurs. Our results suggest that the bulk noise could be seen as a topological susceptibility.</p>

This review highlights recent advancements in the investigations of QSLs, fractional magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets, and unconventional superconductivity in vanadium-based kagome superconductors. We begin by examining the classical ground-state properties of the nearest-neighbor kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and introducing recent experimental progress in the study of QSLs and fractional magnetization plateau phases. Next, we discuss the fermionic description of the QSL states, along with related gauge theory and the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. We then focus on discussing the VMC studies of QSLs and magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets. For superconductivity in kagome systems, we first analyze the characteristics of the electronic structure and the possible associated electronic instabilities.

As the transfer-integral anisotropy approaches the maximally frustrated regime (t'/t \to 1), the lattice stiffens, ruling out lattice softening as the origin of the spin-liquid state. By quantifying the additional suppression of the thermal conductivity from experimental data, we observe a power-law behavior consistent with two-dimensional magnetic excitations with a nodal, approximately linear (Dirac-like) spectrum.</p>

Strategies like collaborative catalytic systems and multifunctional catalysts are effective but face challenges at the nanoscale. Carbon nanotube synthesis contains complicated nanoscale catalytic reactions, thus achieving high-density, high-quality semiconducting CNTs demands innovative catalyst design. In this work, we present a holistic framework integrating machine learning into traditional catalyst design for semiconducting CNT synthesis. It combines knowledge-based insights with data-driven techniques. Three key components, including open-access electronic structure databases for precise physicochemical descriptors, pre-trained natural language processing-based embedding model for higher-level abstractions, and physical - driven predictive models based on experiment data, are utilized. Through this framework, a new method for selective semiconducting CNT synthesis via catalyst - mediated electron injection, tuned by light during growth, is proposed. 54 candidate catalysts are screened, and three with high potential are identified. High-throughput experiments validate the predictions, with semiconducting selectivity exceeding 91% and the FeTiO3 catalyst reaching 98.6%. This approach not only addresses semiconducting CNT synthesis but also offers a generalizable methodology for global catalyst design and nanomaterials synthesis, advancing materials science in precise control.</p>

            <p>High-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials remains a major challenge in physics due to the complexity of their strongly correlated electronic states. Interfacial strain is a powerful lever for tuning electronic correlations in complex oxides, offering new pathways to control emergent quantum phases. Here, we report the discovery of interfacial strain modulated correlated plasmons observed exclusively in superconducting La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) through spectroscopic ellipsometry. This form of plasmons is absent in the non-superconducting LSCO counterparts. Detailed analysis reveals that these correlated plasmons, arising from the collective excitations within Mott-correlated bands, are driven by long-range electronic correlations in the Cu-O planes. Furthermore, long-range electronic correlations, intricately modulated by interfacial strain, may play a crucial role in the emergence of superconductivity and in tuning the transition temperature. Dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the extended Hubbard model suggest that long-range Coulomb interactions play an important role in LSCO, showing good agreement with our experimental findings. The collective evidence from both the experimental results and theoretical findings provides new insights into the nature of collective excitations and their pivotal role in the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Fractional Chern insulators arise in topologically nontrivial flat bands, characterized by an integer Chern number C that corresponds to the number of dissipationless edge states in the non-interacting regime. Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice. Our work provides a general and widely applicable strategy for constructing higher Chern number flat bands, opening a pathway to explore exotic fractional quantum phases</p>

            <p>We extend the capabilities of correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem by implementing the analytical atomic forces within the random phase approximation (RPA), in the context of plane waves and pseudopotentials. Forces are calculated at self-consistency through the optimized effective potential method and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition, non-self-consistent RPA forces, starting from the PBE generalized gradient approximation, are evaluated using density functional perturbation theory. In both cases, we find forces of excellent numerical quality. Furthermore, for most molecules and solids studied, self-consistency is found to have a negligible impact on the computed geometries and vibrational frequencies. The RPA is shown to systematically improve over PBE and, by including the exact-exchange kernel within RPA + exchange (RPAx), through finite-difference total energy calculations, we obtain an accuracy comparable to advanced wavefunction methods. Finally, we estimate the anharmonic shift and provide accurate theoretical references based on RPA and RPAx for the zone-center optical phonon of diamond, silicon, and germanium.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Thalmeier</p>
            <p>The influence of hyperfine coupling to nuclear spins and of their quadrupolar splitting on the induced moment order in singlet ground state magnets is investigated. The latter are found among non-Kramers f electron compounds. Without coupling to the nuclear spins these magnets have a quantum critical point (QCP) separating paramagnetic and induced moment regime. The hyperfine interaction suppresses the QCP and leads to a gradual crossover between induced electronic and nuclear hyperfine coupling dominated magnetic order. It is shown how the critical temperature depends on the electronic and nuclear control parameters including the nuclear spin size and its possible nuclear quadrupole splitting. In particular the dependence of the specific heat on the control parameters and applied field is investigated for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order. It is shown that the three peak structure in the electronic induced moment regime gradually changes to a two-peak structure in the hyperfine coupling dominated nuclear moment order regime or for increasing field strength. Most importantly the possibility of a reentrance behaviour of magnetic order or likewise nonmonotonic critical fields due to hyperfine coupling influence is demonstrated. Finally the systematic evolution of the phase diagram under the influence of nuclear quadrupole coupling is clarified.</p>

This study explores ML to predict the size of Cu NPs from microwave-assisted polyol synthesis using a small data set of 25 in-house performed syntheses. Latin Hypercube Sampling is used to efficiently cover the parameter space while creating the experimental data set. Ensemble regression models, built with the AMADEUS framework, successfully predict particle sizes with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.74$), outperforming classical statistical approaches ($R^2 = 0.60$). Overall, this study highlights that, for lab-scale synthesis optimization, high-quality small datasets combined with classical, interpretable ML models outperform traditional statistical methods and are fully sufficient for quantitative synthesis prediction. This approach provides a sustainable and experimentally realistic pathway toward data-driven inorganic synthesis design.</p>

            <h2>Spectroscopy of Wigner crystal polarons in an atomically thin semiconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Wang, F. Menzel, F. Pichler, P. Knüppel, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, M. Knap, T. Smoleński</p>
            <p>Strongly interacting electrons in two-dimensional systems can spontaneously break translational symmetry, forming a periodic Wigner crystal. Although these crystals have been realized in several platforms, experimental studies of their collective many-body excitations in the absence of a magnetic field remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we access this regime optically by uncovering Wigner crystal polarons: novel light-matter excitations arising from the dressing of excitons by collective excitations of the Wigner crystal. These hybrid quasiparticles manifest as new optical resonances in cryogenic reflectance spectra of a charge-tunable WSe$_2$ monolayer, appearing concurrently with previously identified exciton umklapp transitions. In contrast to the latter, the energies of Wigner crystal polarons are governed not only by the electronic lattice constant but also by their hybridization with attractive exciton-polarons, whose strength is controlled by electronic interactions. These novel many-body excitations provide an optical interface to the spin state of the Wigner crystal, which as we demonstrate, can be controlled both magnetically and optically. Our work establishes layered materials as a unique platform for exploring dynamical impurity dressing by strongly correlated electronic orders.</p>

            <p>We report the transverse control of spin-wave propagation in the configuration where the spin-wave wavevector k is perpendicular to the charge-current density J. Building on theoretical predictions of spin-wave refraction by nonuniform spin-polarized currents, and guided by micromagnetic simulations used to optimize the device geometry and current distribution, we experimentally explore a Y-shaped Permalloy structure in which a locally injected current perturbs the spin-wave dispersion. Measurements reveal current-dependent amplitude differences between the two output branches, providing initial experimental indications consistent with transverse, spin-transfer-torque-driven deflection. Although the magnitude of the effect is modest and accompanied by significant uncertainties, the observed trends qualitatively follow expectations from the simulations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of influencing spin-wave routing through local current injection and establish a proof-of-concept basis for current-controlled manipulation of spin-wave propagation in reconfigurable magnonic circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gyeongjun Lee, Antoine Borel, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Fausto Sirotti, Fabian Cadiz</p>
            <p>Controlled activation of defect-bound excitonic states in two-dimensional semiconductors provides a route to isolated quantum emitters and a sensitive probe of defect physics. Here we demonstrate that \textit{in situ} high-temperature annealing of hBN-encapsulated monolayer WS$_2$ on a suspended microheater leads to the emergence of spectrally isolated single-photon emitters at cryogenic temperatures. Annealing at temperatures around 1100 K produces a sharp emission line, $X_L$, red-shifted by approximately 80 meV from the neutral exciton and exhibiting a linewidth below 200 $\mu$eV. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy and power-dependent measurements show that $X_L$ originates from annealing-induced defects in the WS$_2$ monolayer, while second-order photon correlation measurements reveal clear antibunching with $g^{(2)}(0)<0.5$. These results establish high-temperature \textit{in situ} annealing as a controlled means to access defect-bound excitonic states and single-photon emission in van der Waals materials.</p>

            <p>This paper reviews recent advances in the field of metallic glasses, focusing on the development of novel experimental techniques and in silico models. We discuss progress in experimental characterization, additive manufacturing, multiscale modeling approaches, and the growing role of machine learning in understanding and designing these complex materials. On the experimental side, we highlight measurements of thermophysical properties of supercooled liquids via fast chip calorimetry and enhancements in mechanical properties through rejuvenation treatments. This work underscores the crucial role of short-range order and medium-range order in controlling metallic glass mechanical properties. Recent progress in structural probes allows in situ observations of deformation mechanisms, positioning the field well to further advance our understanding of mechanical properties. Additive manufacturing of metallic glasses is discussed as one encouraging new manufacturing route for metallic glasses. We examine laser powder-bed fusion process physics and the central trade-off between amorphicity and densification, including heat affected zone devitrification and defects formation, together with emerging mitigation strategies and applications. On the theoretical and simulation side, we review advances in nanoscale, mesoscale, and continuum modeling of metallic glasses that have led to promising approaches by which multiscale schemes can incorporate data sourced from atomic-scale simulations. These efforts have helped to elucidate the connection between the glass structure and mechanical and rheological responses. We also cover the development of machine learning interatomic potentials for metallic glasses, along with machine learning driven prediction of glass forming ability and inverse design methods. Finally, challenges and directions for future research are presented and discussed.</p>

            <p>We investigate the interplay between spin currents and spin waves in nanofabricated Permalloy waveguides with geometrical constrictions. Using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy, micromagnetic simulations, and analytical modeling, we provide experimental evidence that spin-wave phase can be modulated by inhomogeneous spin-transfer torques generated by current-density gradients shaped by the constriction geometry. Narrower constrictions enhance these gradients and modify the internal field for Damon-Eshbach spin waves, resulting in pronounced changes in spin-wave group velocity and phase. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of deterministic phase modulation via engineered nonuniform spin-transfer torques. Beyond enabling a scalable route to magnonic interferometry - a building block for spin-wave-based computing - our findings establish a platform to control spin-wave dynamics in spatially varying current landscapes, relevant for analogue-gravity experiments in condensed matter systems.</p>

            <p>Wigner crystals, lattices made purely of electrons, are a quintessential paradigm of studying correlation-driven quantum phase transitions. Despite decades of research, the internal dynamics of Wigner crystals has remained extremely challenging to access, with most experiments probing only static order or collective motion. Here, we establish monolayer WSe2 as a new materials platform to host zero-field Wigner crystals and then demonstrate that exciton spectroscopy provides a direct means to probe both static and dynamic properties of these electron lattices. We uncover striking optical resonances that we identify as Wigner polarons, quasiparticles formed when the electron lattice is locally distorted by exciton-Wigner crystal coupling. We further achieve all-optical control of spins in the Wigner crystal, directly probing valley-dependent Wigner polaron scattering well above the magnetic ordering temperature and in the absence of any external magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate optical melting of the Wigner crystal and observe intriguingly different responses of the umklapp (static) and Wigner polaron (dynamic) resonances to optical excitation. Our results open up exciting new avenues for elucidating electron dynamics and achieving ultrafast optical control of interaction-driven quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electron systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Lu, Iain Dixon, Kwangmin Kim, Yan Xin, Hongyu Bai</p>
            <p>The REBCO coated conductor has the potential to be widely used in ultrahigh field magnets. It is well known, however, that it is not mechanically strong against delamination in the direction normal to its surface due to its intrinsic layered structure. Therefore, conductor delamination is one of the major design challenges for REBCO magnet coils. As a part of the development of the 40 T all-superconducting magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, USA (NHMFL), a dry-wound resistive-insulation-nested-coils (RINC) was designed to reach 25.8 T. It used surface-treated stainless-steel tape as a co-wind to control the turn-to-turn contact resistance, and was fabricated and tested in a liquid helium bath. During the test, two of the double pancake modules exhibited resistive transitions at a current significantly lower than the designed value. The postmortem inspection of the REBCO conductor of these modules by reel-to-reel magnetization at 77 K found sections of very low critical current. Further investigations of one section by chemical etching, visual inspection, and electron microscopy revealed that conductor of this section was delaminated. We present the detailed findings of these postmortem characterizations. The implication of this type of delamination for future magnet designs will be discussed.</p>

            <p>Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a platform for realizing Wigner crystals and enable their detection via exciton spectroscopy. We develop a microscopic theoretical model for excitons interacting with the localized electrons of the Wigner crystal, including their vibrational motion. In addition to the previously observed exciton-Umklapp feature, the theory reproduces and explains the higher-band attractive-polaron resonances recently reported experimentally. Our model further uncovers that the appearance of two equal-strength and parallel attractive polarons, as commonly observed in WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, is a signature of strong correlations in the electronic system. Altogether, our results demonstrate that accounting for electronic interactions is essential to reproduce and interpret the exciton-polaron spectra of TMDs.</p>

            <p>Time-resolved multi-terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is used to observe pump fluence-dependent dynamics in the optical conductivity of photoexcited tin selenide (SnSe) over an ultrabroadband spectral range of 0.5 - 11 THz at fluences from 0.1 - 7.5 mJ/cm$^2$. At pump fluences below 3 mJ/cm$^2$, we observe a free carrier Drude spectrum and broad phonon resonances typical of a photoexcited semiconductor. With increasing fluence, a suppression of the DC photoconductivity is observed, indicating an interruption of long range transport due to phase disorder. Concomitantly, the c-axis polarized $B^2_{1u}$ optical phonon narrows and blueshifts, consistent with a transition to a higher symmetry structure. At intermediate fluences of 3.1 mJ/cm$^2$, a high frequency Lorentzian component appears that red shifts on a 50 ps time scale, where a Drude spectrum is eventually restored. Our results provide evidence for a non-thermal, photo-induced nucleation of higher symmetry, semi-metallic phase domains in SnSe appearing within 200 fs with the system relaxing back to its homogeneous $Pnma$ semiconducting phase on a 200 ps time scale.</p>

            <p>Fluid ferroelectrics, a recently discovered class of liquid crystals that exhibit switchable, long-range polar order, offer opportunities in ultrafast electro-optic technologies, responsive soft matter, and next-generation energy materials. Yet their discovery has relied almost entirely on intuition and chance, limiting progress in the field. Here we develop and experimentally validate a deep-learning data-to-molecule pipeline that enables the targeted design and synthesis of new organic fluid ferroelectrics. We curate a comprehensive dataset of all known longitudinally polar liquid-crystal materials and train graph neural networks that predict ferroelectric behaviour with up to 95% accuracy and achieve root mean square errors as low as 11 K for transition temperatures. A graph variational autoencoder generates de novo molecular structures which are filtered using an ensemble of high-performing classifiers and regressors to identify candidates with predicted ferroelectric nematic behaviour and accessible transition temperatures. Integration with a computational retrosynthesis engine and a digitised chemical inventory further narrows the design space to a synthesis-ready longlist. 11 candidates were synthesised and characterized through established mixture-based extrapolation methods. From which extrapolated ferroelectric nematic transitions were compared against neural network predictions. The experimental verification of novel materials augments the original dataset with quality feedback data thus aiding future research. These results demonstrate a practical, closed-loop approach to discovering synthesizable fluid ferroelectrics, marking a step toward autonomous design of functional soft materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luuk H. E. Kempen, Raffaele Cheula, Mie Andersen</p>
            <p>Foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are being developed at a rapid pace, promising closer and closer approximation to ab initio accuracy. This unlocks the possibility to simulate much larger length and time scales. However, benchmarks for these MLIPs are usually limited to ordered, crystalline and bulk materials. Hence, reported performance does not necessarily accurately reflect MLIP performance in real applications such as heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we systematically analyze zero-shot performance of 80 different MLIPs, evaluating tasks typical for heterogeneous catalysis across a range of different data sets, including adsorption and reaction on surfaces of alloyed metals, oxides, and metal-oxide interfacial systems. We demonstrate that current-generation foundational MLIPs can already perform at high accuracy for applications such as predicting vacancy formation energies of perovskite oxides or zero-point energies of supported nanoclusters. However, limitations also exist. We find that many MLIPs catastrophically fail when applied to magnetic materials, and structure relaxation in the MLIP generally increases the energy prediction error compared to single-point evaluation of a previously optimized structure. Comparing low-cost task-specific models to foundational MLIPs, we highlight some core differences between these model approaches and show that -- if considering only accuracy -- these models can compete with the current generation of best-performing MLIPs. Furthermore, we show that no single MLIP universally performs best, requiring users to investigate MLIP suitability for their desired application.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Barnowsky, Carsten Timm, Rico Friedrich</p>
            <p>Exfoliation and cleavage create two-dimensional (2D) materials and surfaces with physical and chemical properties distinct from their bulk parents. The rising class of non-van der Waals (non-vdW) 2D materials derived from non-layered crystals provides a fascinating new platform - greatly expanding the landscape of low-dimensional materials. Current computational models, however, provide limited guidance: existing descriptors are largely tailored to vdW layered systems. Here, we introduce a general framework predicting crystal cleavage and exfoliable 2D subunits directly from bulk structures. At its core is a universal eXfoliation and Cleavage Potential (XCP) enabling large-scale screening of diverse materials at negligible computational cost. Applying this approach, we obtain 37,208 cleavable surfaces and candidate non-vdW 2D materials from which we investigate 2,377 likely exfoliable ones using high-throughput density functional theory. We identify sheets with square and rectangular lattices, semiconducting systems exhibiting an indirect-to-direct band-gap transition upon exfoliation, and first non-vdW 2D metals. Our study thus opens a systematic route to explore and design new 2D materials with unprecedented chemical and structural diversity.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of anisotropic particles are dictated by forces and torques that can be challenging to mathematically represent in computer simulations. Several data-driven approaches have been developed to approximate these interactions, but they often rely on having large amounts of training data that may be practically difficult to generate. Here, we extend a framework we recently developed for approximating anisotropic pair potentials to the approximation of pairwise forces and torques. The framework uses multivariate polynomials and physics-motivated coordinate transformations to produce accurate approximations using limited amounts of data. We first derive expressions relating the force and torque to partial derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the transformed coordinates used to represent the particle configuration. We then explore several options for approximating the forces and torques, and we critically assess their accuracy using model two- and three-dimensional shape-anisotropic nanoparticles as test cases. We find that interpolation of the pairwise potential energy produces the best result when it is known, but force and torque matching (regression) is a viable strategy when only the force and torque is available.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandru Ciobanu, David Dahmen, John Paul Strachan, Moritz Helias</p>
            <p>Combinatorial optimization problems have a broad range of applications and map to physical systems with complex dynamics. Among them, the 3-SAT problem is prominent due to its NP-complete nature. In physics terms, its solution corresponds to finding the ground state of a disordered Ising spin Hamiltonian with third-order, or tensor, interactions. The large growth of the number of third-order interactions with number of variables poses technical difficulties for the physical implementation of minimizers. Therefore, researchers have proposed quadratization techniques which reduce the order of the system, however, at the cost of including additional degrees of freedom. Their inclusion induces a drastic slow down in the minimization, which makes such procedures technically infeasible for large problems. In this work, we take a physics approach by employing the renormalization group to create a pairwise interacting system from the original third-order system while preserving the free energy. Our procedure utilizes additional degrees of freedom that exhibit an independent dynamics provided the original degrees of freedom are fixed. A step-wise trace of the extra variables while running the minimization is therefore theoretically manageable, yielding a state-dependent effective interaction. We use the effective interaction to reconstruct the original third-order energy spectrum, as this yields equal scaling of computations-to-ground-state compared to the original tensor formulation. Here, the original degrees of freedom interact with a subsystem that appears to be in a superposition of an exponentially large number of states. In the zero-temperature limit, the superposition concentrates on one state. Our spectrum-engineering techniques reveal new routes toward the ground state of disordered Ising systems, through Markov chains, and allow for efficient technological implementations.</p>

            <p>Conjugated organic molecules play a central role in a wide range of optoelectronic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes, organic field-effect transistors, and organic solar cells. A major bottleneck in the computational design of these materials is the discrepancy between simulation and experimental time and length scales. Coarse-graining (CG) offers a promising solution to bridge this gap by reducing redundant degrees of freedom and smoothing the potential energy landscape, thereby significantly accelerating molecular dynamics simulations. However, standard CG models are typically parameterized from homogeneous bulk simulations and assume density-independent effective interactions. As a consequence, they often fail to replicate inhomogeneous systems, such as (free-standing) thin films, due to an incorrect representation of liquid-vacuum interfacial properties. In this work, we develop a CG parametrization strategy that incorporates local-density-dependent potentials to capture material heterogeneities. We evaluate the methodology by simulating free-standing films and comparing interfacial orientational order parameters between all-atom and CG simulations. The resulting CG models accurately reproduce bulk densities and radial distribution functions as well as molecular orientations at the liquid-vacuum interface. This work paves the way for reliable, computation-driven predictions of atomically resolved interfacial ordering in organic molecular systems.</p>

            <p>We present a spin-dependent extension of the non-orthogonal generalized Wannier function (NGWF) formalism within the framework of linear-scaling density functional theory (LS-DFT) as implemented in the ONETEP code. In traditional LS-DFT representations, both spin channels are constrained to share a common variational basis, which limits the accuracy for systems that are spin-polarized or exhibit magnetic order. Our approach allows NGWFs to vary independently for each spin channel, enabling a more accurate representation of spin-polarization in the electronic density. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through a series of test cases, including localized magnetic defects in two-dimensional hBN, transition metal complexes, two-dimensional van der Waals magnetic materials, and both bulk and nanocluster ferromagnetic Co. In each scenario, the incorporation of spin-dependent NGWFs results in enhanced accuracy for total energy calculations, improved localization of spin density, and accurate predictions of magnetic ground states. This improvement is particularly notable when combined with DFT+U and DFT+U+J corrections. In this work, we take the opportunity to describe the combination of DFT+U+J and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) formalism within the LS-DFT framework, including how PAW participates in the ionic Pulay force, and in the minimum-tracking linear response approach for computing parameters in situ. Our findings demonstrate that spin-dependent NGWFs are a crucial and computationally efficient advancement in the linear-scaling DFT simulation of spin-polarized materials.</p>

            <p>We investigate the statistical correlation between the first-reaction time of a diffusing particle and its boundary local time accumulated until the reaction event. Since the reaction event occurs after multiple encounters of the particle with a partially reactive boundary, the boundary local time as a proxy for the number of such encounters is not independent of, but intrinsically linked to, the first-reaction time. We propose a universal theoretical framework to derive their joint probability density and, in particular, the correlation coefficient. To illustrate the dependence of these correlations on the boundary reactivity and shape, we obtain explicit analytical solutions for several basic domains. The analytical results are complemented by Monte Carlo simulations, which we employ to examine the role of interior obstacles on correlations in disordered media. Applications of these statistical results in chemical physics are discussed</p>

            <h2>Structure of the mean-field yrast spectrum of a two-component Bose gas in a ring: role of interaction asymmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Tang, Guan-Hua Huang, Eugene Zaremba, Shizhong Zhang, Zhigang Wu</p>
            <p>The mean-field yrast spectrum of an SU(2)-symmetric two-component Bose gas confined to a ring geometry is known to exhibit an intricate nonanalytic structure that is absent in single-component systems. In particular, due to the interplay between the species concentration and the atomic interactions, a sequence of plane-wave states can emerge as yrast states at fractional values of the angular momentum per particle. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the single-component case, where plane-wave states occur only at integer angular momenta. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of the yrast spectrum in a two-component Bose gas is modified by interaction asymmetry. By numerically solving the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for propagating soliton states, we compute the mean-field yrast spectrum and, in particular, determine the critical curves associated with the emergence of various plane-wave yrast states. We find that both the behavior of these critical curves and the mechanisms by which plane-wave yrast states arise depend sensitively on the relative strengths of the inter- and intra-component interactions. When the inter-component interaction is weaker, the plane-wave yrast states replace soliton states through a continuous evolution, as in the SU(2)-symmetric case, although the conditions for their existence become more restrictive. In contrast, when the inter-component interaction is stronger, plane-wave yrast states emerge by overtaking soliton states via branch crossings, and their stability is significantly enhanced. Our results have important implications for the existence and stability of persistent currents in asymmetric, two-component Bose gases.</p>

            <h2>Strain-Controlled Magnetic Phase Transitions through Anisotropic Exchange Interactions: A Combined DFT and Monte Carlo Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudip Mandal, Mihir Ranjan Sahoo, Kalpataru Pradhan</p>
            <p>Epitaxial strain provides a powerful, non-chemical route to tune the properties of functional materials by manipulating the coupling between spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and $\rm BiFeO_3$ as a model system, we first demonstrate how epitaxial strain exactly leads to anisotropic magnetic interactions where the exchange coupling along the $c$-axis differs from that in the $ab$-plane. We show that subtle structural modifications, specifically the distortion from a cubic to a tetragonal lattice, drive a magnetic phase transition from a G-type to a C-type antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. The anisotropy in magnetic interactions, which becomes prominent in the lower symmetry tetragonal phase, provides a direct link between the structural distortion and the potential change in magnetic ordering. For a more comprehensive study, we next investigate the role of strain in driving magnetic phase transitions within a half-filled one-band Hubbard model in three dimensions. In this framework, strain is introduced through anisotropic hopping processes between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor sites, inspired by the DFT calculations. Using a semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) approach, we construct ground state phase diagrams in the nonperturbative regime, which show how uniaxial strain stabilizes distinct magnetic ground states: Compressive strain drives a transition from a G-type to a C-type AF insulator, whereas tensile strain suppresses the C-type AF order, favoring an A-type AF phase. Overall, our combined DFT and s-MC calculations highlight that strain is a powerful tuning parameter for controlling competing magnetic phases by governing exchange coupling mechanisms in correlated systems, offering valuable insights for the design of strain-controlled materials.</p>

            <p>FeSe stands out among iron-based superconductors due to its extended nematic phase without the onset of long-range magnetic order. While strain-dependent electrical resistivity has been extensively explored to probe nematicity, its influence on magneto-transport properties remains less understood. In this work, we present measurements of the magneto-elasto-resistivity in FeSe as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Using a minimal multiband Boltzmann model for transport we derive analytical expressions that capture the magnetic behavior of the whole set of experimental data both in the paramagnetic and in the nematic phase. These findings indicate that a multiband framework can robustly describe the magneto-elasto-transport properties in FeSe and arguably in other iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Comparing Hubbard parameters from linear-response theory and Hartree-Fock-based approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wooil Yang, Iurii Timrov, Francesco Aquilante, Young-Woo Son</p>
            <p>Density-functional theory with on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$+$V$) is a powerful and accurate method for predicting various properties of transition-metal compounds. However, its accuracy depends critically on the values of these Hubbard parameters. Although they can be determined empirically, first-principles methods provide a more consistent and reliable approach; yet, their results can vary, and a comprehensive comparison between methods is still lacking. Here, we present a systematic comparison of two widely used approaches for computing $U$ and $V$, namely linear-response theory (LRT) and the Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism, applied to a representative set of oxides (MnO, NiO, CoO, FeO, BaTiO$_3$, ZnO, and ZrO$_2$). We find that for partially occupied transition-metal $d$ states, these two methods yield consistent $U$ values, but they differ for nearly empty or fully filled $d$ shells. For O-$2p$ states, LRT always predicts large $U$ values ($\sim$10 eV), whereas the pseudohybrid formalism produces system-dependent values depending on the level of localization and hybridization for the electronic states. Even larger differences are found for the inter-site $V$: the former predicts consistently small values ($<1$ eV), while the latter produces larger values ($\sim3$ eV), reflecting its explicit dependence on relative charge redistribution. Our results show that while parallels between these two methods exist, they rely on distinct assumptions for determining $U$ and $V$, leading to variations in predictions of material properties.</p>

Lately, the use of non-local proposal updates in a collective-variable (CV) space has been proposed in several works.

We prove reversibility of the resulting scheme and demonstrate its performance on several numerical examples, observing a substantial performance increase compared to methods based on overdamped Langevin dynamics as considered previously. Advances in generative machine-learning-based proposal samplers now enable efficient sampling in CV spaces of intermediate dimensionality (tens to hundreds of variables), and our results extend their applicability toward more realistic molecular systems.</p>

            <p>Thermodynamic stability of N$_2$ clathrate hydrates in the sI and sII structures is investigated using density functional theory with several exchange-correlation functionals, explicitly accounting for composition (cage occupancies) and pressure at T = 0 K. Among the tested functionals, revPBE-D3(0) best reproduces experimental lattice parameters and bulk moduli B$_0$ . Energetic analyses confirm the strong impact of large cage double occupancy on sI, whereas the convex-hull results show that sI with single occupancy remains thermodynamically stable up to $\sim$ 0.8 GPa alongside sII with single occupancy. Increasing pressure then stabilizes sII with double occupancy, consistent with its larger large-cage volume and lower framework strain. These results provide a coherent, first-principles thermodynamic framework for N$_2$ hydrate stability and a baseline for finite-temperature extension.</p>

            <p>We study spin-triplet superconductivity with both unitary and nonunitary pairing in the presence of an external Zeeman magnetic field. Within a mean-field framework, we exactly diagonalize the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and derive general expressions for the quasiparticle spectrum, superconducting gap, critical temperature, and spin magnetization, valid for arbitrary magnetic-field strengths and temperatures. We analyze in detail the nonlinear spin susceptibility and the field evolution of the superconducting gap and transition temperature, highlighting qualitative differences between unitary and nonunitary pairing states. Our results are broadly applicable to a wide range of materials, including systems with both weak and strong spin-orbit coupling. We show that systematic measurements of the critical temperature and spin susceptibility as functions of the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field provide a powerful means to identify the structure of the spin-triplet order parameter, and we discuss implications of our findings for candidate materials such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$.</p>

            <h2>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of CoNb$_2$O$_6$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshito Watanabe, Simon Trebst, Ciarán Hickey</p>
            <p>With recent advances in terahertz (THz) sources and detection, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which allows to probe nonlinear responses in a two-frequency plane, now reaches the meV regime relevant for quasiparticle excitations in magnetic materials. This opens a promising route to reveal many-body phenomena that evade linear-response probes. To date most experimental applications have focused on classical magnets, and a solid demonstration in a quantum magnet has yet to be established. Here we present a theoretical study of 2DCS in CoNb$_2$O$_6$, a quasi-one-dimensional Ising magnet that is believed to host fractionalized spinons which at low temperatures are confined by weak interchain coupling. Our analysis, which builds on an effective $S=1/2$ Hamiltonian is found to reveal unambiguous 2DCS signatures of spinon deconfinement above the low-temperature ordered phase. Using a four-spinon approximation, we track these 2DCS signatures by sequentially building a faithful microscopic model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$, starting from the exactly solvable one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (1$d$ TFIM) and successively adding interactions to capture its key low-energy physics. In particular, adding a bond-dependent staggered YZ interaction to the 1$d$-TFIM already reproduces many key spectral features of the full material Hamiltonian. Within this TFIM+YZ model, we find a series of bound states, including a four-spinon bound state that is distinct from the familiar two-spinon bound states. We further find that introducing a confinement potential suppresses sharp spinon-echo features in the two-frequency space, which are thought to reflect an underlying continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our results provide concrete predictions and clear targets for future THz 2DCS experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and related quasi-one-dimensional quantum magnets.</p>

            <h2>Optimal array geometries for kinetic magnetism and Nagaoka polarons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N. Hernandez-Cepeda, Sergio E. Ulloa</p>
            <p>Quantum dot (QD) platforms have enabled the direct observation of Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NFM) in small arrays and non-infinite interaction strength. However, optimizing the cluster connectivity characteristics that yield a ground state with maximal spin and their robustness against magnetic fields remains unexplored. Employing exact diagonalization of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, we find a connection between the existence of kinetic ferromagnetism and graph theory descriptions. Algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) and Katz centrality (KC) are shown to be related to the spin-correlation over the system. In square arrays, the onset of NFM is found to be $t_c/U\simeq \lambda_2^2$. In optimal cluster geometries, large $\lambda_2$ and low KC fluctuation per site are found to enhance $t_c/U$, extending the NFM phase while diminishing the strength of spin correlation clouds. A perpendicular magnetic field introduces Aharonov-Bohm phases, and a critical flux for which NFM is destroyed. We further find that tuning the flux phase to $\pi$ results in a ground state that exhibits antiferromagnetic correlations (counter-Nagaoka state). Our results illustrate how NFM and polaron formation can be predicted from the array's connectivity ($\lambda_2$ and KC), and how the introduction of flux results in the counterintuitive destruction of kinetic ferromagnetism in the system.</p>

            <h2>Revival Dynamics from Equilibrium States: Scars from Chords in SYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debarghya Chakraborty, Dario Rosa</p>
            <p>We develop a novel framework to build quantum many-body scar states in bipartite systems characterized by perfect correlation between the Hamiltonians governing the two sides. By means of a Krylov construction, we build an interaction term which supports a tower of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. This gives rise to finite-time revivals whenever the system is initialized in a purification of a generic equilibrium state. The dynamics is universally characterized, and is largely independent of the specific details of the Hamiltonians defining the individual partitions. By considering the two-sided chord states of the double-scaled SYK model, we find an approximate realization of this framework. We analytically study the revival dynamics, finding rigid motion for wavepackets localized on the spectrum of a single SYK copy. These findings are tested numerically for systems of finite size, showing excellent agreement with the analytical predictions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Schwager, Theresa Appel, Jamal Berakdar</p>
            <p>The motion of a quantum particle constrained to a two-dimensional non-compact Riemannian manifold with non-trivial metric can be described by a flat-space Schroedinger-type equation at the cost of introducing local mass and metric and geometry-induced effective potential with no classical counterpart. For a metric tensor periodically modulated along one dimension, the formation of bands is demonstrated and transport-related quantities are derived. Using S-matrix approach, the quantum conductance along the manifold is calculated and contrasted with conventional quantum transport methods in flat spaces. The topology, e.g. whether the manifold is simply connected, compact or non-compact shows up in global, non-local properties such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase. The results vividly demonstrate emergent phenomena due to the interplay of reduced-dimensionality, particles quantum nature, geometry, and topology.</p>

            <h2>Random planting with harvest: A statistical-mechanical analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Talbot</p>
            <p>We formulate a statistical-mechanical description of a recently introduced random planting model in which plants are represented by growing hard disks. Seedlings of negligible size are introduced at random positions in a field, grow at a prescribed rate, and are harvested upon reaching a fixed maturity diameter. Planting attempts that would lead to an overlap at any time during growth are rejected. Starting from an empty field, this simple dynamical rule drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state in which the mean planting and harvesting rates coincide. We show that the steady state can be mapped onto a nonadditive polydisperse hard-disk fluid and exploit this mapping to develop analytical predictions based on a low-density virial expansion and on scaled particle theory. The resulting description yields an effective adsorption isotherm for the steady-state plant density as a function of the planting rate and compares favorably with numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. At large planting rates, the density approaches the optimal value achieved by desynchronized regular planting, and the data are consistent with an algebraic approach to this limit with an exponent close to 1/3. Beyond density and yield, we show that the spatial organization of the field at high planting rates exhibits clear signatures of the same underlying geometric constraints that characterize optimal desynchronized planting. This connection is revealed through both the conventional radial distribution function and a radius-resolved pair correlation g(z,r) which highlights strong size correlations associated with parent-child seeding events and whose structure can be interpreted as a dynamically broadened precursor of the corresponding ideal mixe--size lattice. Finally, we extend the theory to sigmoidal growth laws and compute the associated virial coefficient.</p>

            <p>The thermal Hall effect has emerged as a powerful probe of exotic excitations in correlated quantum materials, providing access to charge-neutral heat carriers that remain invisible to electrical transport. To directly examine how heat and charge respond in relation within a kagome metal, we investigate the ferrimagnetic rare-earth 1-6-6 compound TbCr6Ge6 using the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) framework. We observe a dramatic breakdown of the WF law across the ferrimagnetic transition, where both longitudinal and transverse Lorenz ratios, L_{xx,xy} = \kappa_{xx,xy} / (T \sigma_{xx,xy}), deviate strongly from the Sommerfeld value L_0. After a partial recovery toward L_0 near 5-7 K, the Lorenz ratios are sharply suppressed well below L_0 despite a metallic charge response. We further find a pronounced low-temperature suppression of both L_{xx} and L_{xy} and a sign-changing transverse Lorenz ratio, indicating a clear decoupling between heat and charge transport and signaling substantial contributions from charge-neutral excitations whose Berry-curvature-driven transverse response evolves with temperature and magnetic field. TbCr6Ge6 thus provides a tunable metallic platform in which exchange-driven ferrimagnetism governs both longitudinal and transverse thermal responses, enabling controlled departures from Wiedemann-Franz behavior over an experimentally accessible temperature and field range.</p>

            <p>Topological textures in magnetically ordered materials are important case studies for fundamental research with promising applications in data science. They can also serve as photonic elements to mold electromagnetic fields endowing them with features inherent to the spin order, as demonstrated analytically and numerically in this work. A self-consistent theory is developed for the interaction of spatially structured electromagnetic fields with non-collinear, topologically non-trivial spin textures. A tractable numerical method is designed and implemented for the calculation of the formed magnetic/photonic textures in the entire simulation space. Numerical illustrations are presented for scattering from point-like singularities, i.e. Bloch points, in the magnetization vector fields, evidencing that the geometry and topology of the magnetic order results in photonic fields that embody orbital angular momentum, chirality as well as magnetoelectric densities. Features of the scattered fields can serve as a fingerprint for the underlying magnetic texture and its dynamics. The findings point to the potential of topological magnetic textures as a route to molding photonic fields.</p>

In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for the emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically by a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and quantum superconductivity.</p>

            <p>With the advent of atomically thin and tunable van der Waals materials, a two-dimensional electronic Wigner crystal has recently been observed. The smoking gun signal was the appearance of an umklapp branch in optical exciton spectroscopy coming from the periodic potential generated by the Wigner crystal assumed to be static. Vibrations of the Wigner crystal however leads to a gapless phonon spectrum, which may affect the exciton spectrum. To explore this, we develop a field theoretical description of an exciton interacting with electrons forming a Wigner crystal including the coupling to the phonons. We show that importance of the exciton-phonon coupling scales with the exciton-electron interaction strength relative to the typical phonon energy squared. The motion of the exciton leads to two kinds of scattering processes, where the exciton emits a phonon either staying within the same Bloch band (intraband scattering) or changing its band (interband scattering). Using a non-perturbative self-consistent Born approximation, we demonstrate that these scattering processes lead to the formation of quasiparticles (polarons) consisting of the exciton in Bloch states dressed by Wigner crystal phonons. The energy shift and damping of these polarons depend on the electron density in a non-trivial way since it affects both the exciton-phonon interaction strength, as well as the phonon and exciton spectra. In particular, the damping is strongly affected by whether the polaron energy is inside the gapless phonon scattering continuum or not. Using these results, we finally analyse their effects on the observed spectral properties of the exciton.</p>

            <p>The world of 2D materials is rapidly expanding with new discoveries of stackable and twistable layered systems composed of lattices of different symmetries, orbital character, and structural motifs. Often, however, it is not clear a priori whether a pair of monolayers twisted at a small angle will exhibit correlated or interaction-driven phenomena. The computational cost to make accurate predictions of the single particle states is significant, as small twists require very large unit cells, easily encompassing 10,000 atoms, and therefore implementing a high throughput prediction has been out of reach. Here we show a path to overcome this challenge by introducing a machine learning (ML) based methodology that efficiently estimates the twisted interlayer tunneling at arbitrarily low twist angles through the local-configuration based approach that enables interpolating the local stacking for a range of twist angles using a random forest regression algorithm. We leverage the kernel polynomial method to compute the density of states (DOS) on large real space graphs by reconstructing a lattice model of the twisted bilayer with the ML fitted hoppings. For twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we show the ability of the method to resolve the magic angle DOS at a substantial improvement in computational time. We use this new technique to scan through the database of stable 2D monolayers (MC2D) and reveal new twistable candidates across the five possible points groups in two-dimensions with a large DOS near the Fermi energy, with potentially exciting interacting physics to be probed in future experiments.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Generative-Predictive Framework for Deterministic Inverse Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reza T. Batley, Sourav Saha</p>
            <p>Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\% relative error) and sub-5\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches.</p>

            <p>In recent years dual-unitary circuits and their multi-unitary generalizations have emerged as exactly solvable yet chaotic models of quantum many-body dynamics. However, a systematic picture for the solvability of multi-unitary dynamics remains missing. We present a framework encompassing a large class of such non-integrable models with exactly solvable dynamics, which we term \emph{completely reducible} circuits. In these circuits, the entanglement membrane determining operator growth and entanglement dynamics can be characterized analytically. Completely reducible circuits extend the notion of space-time symmetry to more general lattice geometries, breaking dual-unitarity globally but not locally, and allow for a rich phenomenology going beyond dual-unitarity. As example, we introduce circuits that support four and five directions of information flow. We derive a general expression for the entanglement line tension in terms of the pattern of information flow in spacetime. The solvability is shown to be related to the absence of knots of this information flow, connecting entanglement dynamics to the Kauffman bracket as knot invariant. Building on these results, we propose that in general non-integrable dynamics the curvature of the entanglement line tension can be interpreted as a density of information transport. Our results provide a new and unified framework for exactly solvable models of many-body quantum chaos, encompassing and extending known constructions.</p>

In this work, we uncover a universal mechanism for realizing maximal entanglement swapping in fermionic Gaussian states subjected to projective Bell measurements. We consider two initially decoupled, half-filled copies of a free-fermion system in arbitrary dimensions and perform post-selective Bell measurements on half of the corresponding sites across the two copies. Remarkably, the post-measurement state factorizes into a product of Bell pairs, establishing maximal interlayer entanglement entirely independent of the initial Gaussian state. We derive this post-measurement state exactly for general particle-number-conserving fermionic Gaussian states, establishing both the validity and universality of the mechanism, with numerical simulations serving as consistency checks. This phenomenon arises from a robust interplay between fermionic statistics and Gaussianity, revealing a distinct fermionic route to measurement-induced maximal entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Higher-form entanglement asymmetry. Part I. The limits of symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Benini, Eduardo García-Valdecasas, Stathis Vitouladitis</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman--Mermin--Wagner theorem, for $0$- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Le Floch, Gela Patashuri, Emilio Trevisani</p>
            <p>Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetric models are known to undergo dimensional reduction; that is, their physics is captured by models in two fewer dimensions. In this work, we revisit dimensional reduction, providing new arguments and reformulating existing proofs in terms of the cohomology of a supercharge $Q$. We obtain three main results. First, we show that the recently developed picture of dimensional reduction via decoupling of operators admits a natural explanation in terms of $Q$-exactness. Second, we provide a new proof of dimensional reduction using the supersymmetric localization argument. Third, we revisit Cardy's ``interpolation'' proof -- which is reminiscent of localization but does not rely on saddle-point methods -- and show that it can be understood as a consequence of deforming the action by a $Q$-exact term. Finally, we show that while existing nonperturbative proofs of dimensional reduction apply only to scalar Lagrangians, our formulation of Cardy's argument extends to any theory with Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetry.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinearly Realised Defect Symmetries and Anomalies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadav Drukker, Ziwen Kong, Petr Kravchuk</p>
            <p>Conformal defects -- extended objects in conformal field theories -- carry localised excitations inherited from symmetry currents, known as the displacements and tilts. They capture the linear response of the defect to deformations of its shape or of its profile along internal symmetry directions. There is no universal formula for deformations beyond the linear order and this is subject to ambiguities of coordinate choices on coset spaces and scheme dependence in the quantum theory. We analyse the exact match between the two and identify the scheme independent quantities capturing nonlinearly realised symmetries. This leads to universal integral identities for correlation functions in the presence of tilts and displacements. We present several applications of them. We also study possible anomalies, recovering known ones, finding new expressions for them, and uncovering new ones.</p>

            <h2>Resource-resolved quantum fluctuation theorems in end-point measurement scheme</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sukrut Mondkar, Sayan Mondal, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>Fluctuation theorems provide universal constraints on nonequilibrium energy and entropy fluctuations, making them a natural framework to assess how and to what extent quantum resources become thermodynamically relevant. We develop a unified framework for incorporating a generic quantum resource, including athermality, quantum coherence, and entanglement, into fluctuation theorems. We work within the end point measurement scheme, which avoids an initial energy measurement and allows quantum resources in the initial state to affect nonequilibrium energy statistics. We derive a family of quantum fluctuation theorems, including generalized Jarzynski equalities and Crooks type fluctuation relations, in which corrections decompose into resource resolved contributions. For single systems, we introduce the concept of weight of athermality, and combine it with the weight of coherence to isolate distinct thermodynamic effects of these quantum resources. For bipartite systems, we furthermore obtain two families of entanglement-resolved fluctuation theorems using an appended correlation operator and the best separable approximation, respectively. Finally, we introduce the concepts of coherence and entanglement fluctuation distances, as Kullback Leibler divergences, which quantify the thermodynamic relevance of quantum resources in a process-dependent and operational manner.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brendan C. Sheehan, Margaret Hubble, Daphna Shimon, Chandrasekhar Ramanathan</p>
            <p>The inhomogeneous distribution of P1 centers in type 1b HPHT diamond samples allows multiple DNP mechanisms to occur within the same crystal, resulting in complex DNP spectra. At some crystal orientations, different DNP mechanisms can compete to drive hyperpolarization with different signs at the same applied microwave frequency. We perform microwave-irradiated DNP using both monochromatic and frequency-modulated microwave excitation to explore the competition between these DNP mechanisms in diamond at room temperature. We demonstrate that frequency-modulated DNP is a tool for suppressing certain DNP mechanisms while enhancing others in a single-crystal diamond sample. Frequency modulation also enables higher enhancement of the NMR signal beyond traditional monochromatic DNP under some conditions. In a powder sample, competing enhancement mechanisms can also arise from different crystallite orientations in the powder. We observe that at certain microwave frequencies the DNP signal changes sign during the polarization build-up, even with monochromatic microwave irradiation. We do not observe this phenomenon in any single-crystal spectrum. We discuss both methods of investigating competing mechanisms of DNP as a means of selectively enhancing different DNP mechanisms driving $^{13}$C NMR signal enhancement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Jia Wang, Ling-Zhi Tang, Yan-Xiong Du, Dan-Wei Zhang</p>
            <p>Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases in periodically driven systems that exhibit spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translation symmetry. The stabilization of most DTC phases is achieved via the disorder-induced many-body localization. In this work, we propose an experimental scheme to realize disorder-free DTCs in a periodically driven Rydberg atom array. Our scheme utilizes a linear potential in the atomic detuning to enhance the DTC order, without being tired to (Stark) many-body localization. We numerically demonstrate that the Stark potential enhances the robustness of the DTC against the flip imperfections and extends its lifetime, which are independent of initial states. Thus, our scheme provides a promising way to explore DTCs in Rydberg atom arrays without disorder averaging and special state preparation.</p>

            <p>We experimentally investigate the dynamics of synthetic active particles composed of gravitationally bouncing, superwalking droplets confined within an annular fluid bath. Driven by a topologically pumping dual-frequency waveform, the droplets exhibit alternating active (walking) and dormant (bouncing) phases, producing intermittent azimuthal motion. Tracking individual droplets reveals pseudolaminar chaotic dynamics in the time series of particle's angular position, characterized by laminar plateaus that are interrupted by short irregular bursts of activity. Increasing the driving amplitude induces a qualitative change in the active particle's intermittent dynamics, arising from a symmetry-breaking transition in its Faraday-wave field environment: continuous SO(2)-symmetric "channelling" waves give way to discrete "trapping" patterns. These findings demonstrate how environmental symmetry and spatiotemporal structure modulate motility and intermittency in synthetic active matter.</p>

            <h2>Predicting the Interfacial Energy and Morphology of DNA Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sihan Liu, Andrej Košmrlj</p>
            <p>The physics and morphology of biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation underpin diverse biological processes, exemplified by the nested organization of nucleoli that facilitates ribosome biogenesis. Here, we develop a theoretical and computational framework to understand and predict multiphase morphologies in DNA-nanostar solutions. Because morphology is governed by interfacial energies between coexisting phases, we combine Flory-Huggins theory with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to examine how these energies depend on key microscopic features of DNA nanostars, including size, valence, bending rigidity, Debye screening length, binding strength, and sticky-end distribution. The phase behavior of DNA nanostars is quantitatively captured by a generalized lattice model, in which the interplay between sticky-end binding energy and conformational entropy determines the effective interactions. Focusing on condensates comprising two dense phases, we find that Janus-like morphologies are ubiquitous because the interfacial energies between the dense and dilute phases, $\gamma_{i\in\{1,2\}}$, are typically comparable. In contrast, nested morphologies are rare as they require a large asymmetry in $\gamma_i$, which arises only for highly dissimilar nanostars such as those differing markedly in valence or size. Moreover, the interfacial energy between the two dense phases, $\gamma_{12}$, can be modulated either discretely, by varying sticky-end distribution, or continuously, by tuning the crosslinker ratio; the former may even eliminate nested configurations. These findings establish physical design principles for constructing complex condensate architectures directly from microscopic molecular parameters.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of higher-order interactions in systems of coupled Kuramoto oscillators with time delay</h2>

            <p>Understanding the mechanisms that govern collective synchronization is a paramount task in nonlinear dynamics. While higher-order (many-body) interactions have recently emerged as a powerful framework for capturing collective behaviors, real-world examples regarding dynamics remain scarce. Here, we show that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from time-delayed pairwise coupling in Kuramoto oscillators. By expanding the delay term up to second order in the coupling strength, we derive an effective Kuramoto model featuring both two-body and three-body interactions, but without delay, hence, easier to be analyzed. Numerical simulations show that this reduced model can reproduce the bistability and synchronization transitions of the original time-delayed system. Furthermore, applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we obtain a stability diagram for incoherent and synchronized states that closely matches the results of the original model. Our findings reveal that time delays can be effectively recast in the form of higher-order interactions, offering a new perspective on how delayed interactions shape the dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun Lee, Panayotis G. Kevrekidis, Wenrui Hao</p>
            <p>In this work, we are motivated by a recent variant of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation describing cold, dilute atomic condensates with quantum fluctuation effects. Our goal is to develop robust numerical methods capable of uncovering diverse stationary solutions in such NLS models. Specifically, and in line with recent theoretical and experimental interest, we focus on ultracold quantum droplets in Bose mixtures influenced by the Lee Huang Yang quantum fluctuation correction and study these systems in one and two dimensional settings. To this end, we deploy several numerical techniques. The homotopy grid method allows systematic refinement from coarse to fine spatial discretizations in one dimension, while the dimension by dimension homotopy approach extends one-dimensional solutions to two-dimensional domains. These methods effectively detect broad families of stationary states, many of which have not been previously reported, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, they enable the monitoring of solution continuation and bifurcation phenomena. During our investigation, we encounter unusual bifurcation events, including nonstandard pitchforks and saddle-center bifurcations, which exhibit novel stability transitions. For example, we identify continuous pathways connecting vortex and dark soliton stripe branches, absent in the standard cubic defocusing model. Overall, the presence of competing mean-field and quantum fluctuation interactions leads to a richer bifurcation structure than in traditional cubic NLS systems. These findings suggest that similar complex bifurcation and stability phenomena may appear in other settings, including higher-dimensional systems or models with competing nonlinearities such as cubic-quintic interactions, highlighting the importance of further theoretical and numerical exploration.</p>

            <p>We develop a neural network framework to predict the five-dimensional background geometry, dilaton potential, and chiral symmetry breaking scalar potential of holographic QCD from unflavored meson mass spectra. The model was trained in a discretized form of the Schrödinger-like equation, which resembles a linear moose in ``deconstructed" 5 dimensions with Dirichlet boundary conditions, in contrast to the AdS/DL with ``emergent" space-time. Using the $\rho$, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $f_0$ unflavored mesons and their excitations as training data, the model learns confining effective potentials and computes a dilaton profile that satisfies the null energy condition. The network predicts the IR behavior of dilaton to be in-between linear and quadratic forms. Moreover, the symmetry-breaking bulk potential of the scalar field, $V(X)= k_1 X^3+k_2 X^4$, was computed, and the parameters $k_1$ and $k_2$ predicted to be $\sim - \ 8$ and $\sim 17$ respectively. The deep-learned parameters, metric, and the dilaton profile were then used to predict the pion mass and its spectrum with good accuracy. A Python code, along with the trained models, is provided to facilitate further studies</p>

            <h2>Timelike Entanglement Entropy and Renormalization Group Flow Irreversibility</h2>

            <p>We study holographic c-theorems based on timelike entanglement entropy and show that a timelike c-function captures irreversible renormalization group (RG) flow. We demonstrate that timelike c-functions are applicable to both relativistic and non-relativistic quantum matter in nematic phases with broken rotational symmetry, and that they remain monotonic even under anisotropic RG flows, thereby passing some of the most stringent consistency tests. Across all classes of theories examined, we find that the null energy condition, thermodynamic stability, and a constraint on an effective spatial dimensionality are jointly sufficient to guarantee monotonicity of the timelike c-function along the RG flow. Moreover, we identify a geometric upper bound on the rate of change of the timelike c-function, which constrains how rapidly effective degrees of freedom can be coarse-grained along the RG flow whenever a timelike c-theorem applies. The applicability of holographic c-theorems is thus extended to highly nontrivial RG flows and points toward a new information-theoretic diagnostic of holographic RG dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Replica Keldysh field theory of quantum-jump processes: General formalism and application to imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Kloiber-Tollinger, Lukas M. Sieberer</p>
            <p>Measurement-induced phase transitions have largely been explored for projective or continuous measurements of Hermitian observables, assuming perfect detection without information loss. Yet such transitions also arise in more general settings, including quantum-jump processes with non-Hermitian jump operators, and under inefficient detection. A theoretical framework for treating these broader scenarios has been missing. Here we develop a comprehensive replica Keldysh field theory for general quantum-jump processes in both bosonic and fermionic systems. Our formalism provides a unified description of pure-state quantum trajectories under efficient detection and mixed-state dynamics emerging from inefficient monitoring, with deterministic Lindbladian evolution appearing as a limiting case. It thus establishes a direct connection between phase transitions in nonequilibrium steady states of driven open quantum matter and in measurement-induced dynamics. As an application, we study imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting in a one-dimensional lattice system: monitored gain and loss of fermions occurring at different rates, with a fraction of gain and loss jumps undetected. For imbalanced but efficient counting, we recover the qualitative picture of the balanced case: entanglement obeys an area law for any nonzero jump rate, with an extended quantum-critical regime emerging between two parametrically separated length scales. Inefficient detection introduces a finite correlation length beyond which entanglement, as quantified by the fermionic logarithmic negativity, obeys an area law, while the subsystem entropy shows volume-law scaling. Numerical simulations support our analytical findings. Our results offer a general and versatile theoretical foundation for studying measurement-induced phenomena across a wide class of monitored and open quantum systems.</p>

We determine for a variety of self-couplings $\hat{\lambda}$ the (negative) critical bare mass $\hat{\mu}_{0\mathrm{c}}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ where the lattice-regularized system changes from the symmetric to the broken phase. Based on these data, the transition to infinite volume and a universal scheme with the renormalized parameter $\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{c}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ is made. Finally, $f_\mathrm{c}=\lim_{\hat{\lambda}\to0}\hat{\lambda}/\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{c}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ is determined, with a judicious choice of the parameterizations considered. Our final result reads $f_\mathrm{c}=11.1097(20)_\mathrm{stat}(09)_\mathrm{sys}=11.1097(22)_\mathrm{tot}$.</p>

            <p>Modern generative models hold great promise for accelerating diverse tasks involving the simulation of physical systems, but they must be adapted to the specific constraints of each domain. Significant progress has been made for biomolecules and crystalline materials. Here, we address amorphous materials (glasses), which are disordered particle systems lacking atomic periodicity. Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials is a notoriously slow and difficult task. This obstacle could be overcome by developing a generative framework capable of producing equilibrium configurations with well-defined likelihoods. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework which combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching. Our method rigorously incorporates periodic boundary conditions and the symmetries of multi-component particle systems, adapting an equivariant graph neural network to operate directly on the torus. Our numerical experiments on model amorphous systems demonstrate that enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints significantly improves generative performance.</p>

            <p>Soon after the dawn of quantum error correction, DiVincenzo and Peres observed that stabilizer codewords could give rise to simple proofs of quantumness via contextuality. This discovery can be recast in the language of nonlocal games: every $n$-qubit stabilizer state defines a specific "stabilizer-testing" $n$-player nonlocal game, which quantum players can win with probability one. If quantum players can moreover outperform all possible classical players, then the state is contextual. However, the classical values of stabilizer-testing games are largely unknown for scalable examples beyond the $n$-qubit GHZ state. We introduce several new methods for upper-bounding the classical values of these games. We first prove a general coding-theory bound for all stabilizer-testing games: if the classical value $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* < 1$, then $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* \leq 7/8$, i.e., there is no classical strategy that can perform as well as the optimal quantum strategy even in an asymptotic sense. We then show how to tighten this bound for the most common scalable examples, namely GHZ, toric-code and cyclic cluster states. In particular, we establish an asymptotically tight upper bound for cyclic cluster states using transfer-matrix methods. This leads to the striking conclusion that measuring an exponentially small fidelity to the cyclic cluster state will suffice to witness its contextuality.</p>

            <p>Earth's relief is approximately self-affine, meaning a zoom-in on a small region looks statistically similar to a large region upon a suitable rescaling. Fractional Brownian surfaces give an idealized self-affine model of Earth's relief with one parameter, the Hurst exponent $H$, characterizing the roughness of the surface. To quantitatively assess agreement with Earth elevation data, we compile a large dataset of topographic profiles of islands (N=131,063 with the range of areas covering 8+ orders of magnitude) and obtain four estimates for the Hurst exponent of Earth's surface by fitting four statistical laws from the theory of self-affine surfaces concerning islands: (i) distribution of areas, (ii) volume-area relationship, (iii) perimeter-area relationship, and (iv) maximum height-area relationship. The estimated Hurst exponents differ greatly, indicating different fractal scaling behavior for different geometric features, but are sorted in order of increasing expected influence of erosion at the shorelines.</p>

            <p>A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.</p>

We use it to construct stationary superflows close to the superfluid-normal phase boundary, and examine their stability. We obtain an exact expression for Landau's critical velocity and show that the standard Newtonian profiles (such as the near-vortex condensate depletion or the boundary-layer decay) persist unmodified in the relativistic setting. We further analyse a genuinely relativistic configuration in which an accelerated superfluid develops a phase boundary induced by Tolman temperature gradients.</p>

We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a Landauer erasure protocol operating beyond the weak-coupling, Markovian, and slow-driving limits. The resulting work probability distributions reveal distinct quantum signatures that are missed by low-order moments yet significantly impact the erasure fidelity of the protocol. Our framework delivers non-perturbative accuracy and detail in characterising energy-exchange fluctuations in driven open quantum systems, establishing a powerful and versatile tool for exploring thermodynamics and control in the operating regimes of both near-term and future quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Molecular crystals possess a highly complex crystallographic landscape which in many cases results in the experimental observation of multiple crystal structures for the same compound. Accurate results can often be obtained for such systems by employing periodic density functional theory using hybrid functionals; however, this is not always computationally feasible. One possibility to circumvent these expensive periodic calculations is the utilization of multimer embedding methods. Therein, the fully periodic crystal is described at a lower level of theory, and subsequently monomer energies, dimer interaction energies, etc. are corrected via high-level calculations. In this paper, we further extend such a multimer embedding approach by one multimer order for all investigated properties, allowing us to compute lattice energies up to the tetramer embedding level, and atomic forces, the stress tensor, and harmonic phonons up to the trimer level. We test the significance of including these higher-order multimers by embedding PBE0+MBD multimers into periodic PBE+MBD calculations utilizing the X23 benchmark set of molecular crystals and comparing the results to explicit periodic PBE0+MBD calculations. We show that tetramer interactions systematically improve the lattice energy approximation and explore multiple possibilities for multimer selection. Furthermore, we confirm that trimer interactions are crucial for the description of the stress tensor, yielding cell volumes within 1 % of those of PBE0+MBD. Subsequently, this also results in an improvement of the description of vibrational properties, giving on average gamma point frequencies within 1.3 wave numbers and vibrational free energies within 0.3 kJ/mol of the PBE0+MBD results.</p>

            <h2>Random purification channel for passive Gaussian bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Anna Mele, Filippo Girardi, Senrui Chen, Marco Fanizza, Ludovico Lami</p>
            <p>The random purification channel, which, given $n$ copies of an unknown mixed state $\rho$, prepares $n$ copies of an associated random purification, has proved to be an extremely valuable tool in quantum information theory. In this work, we construct a Gaussian version of this channel that, given $n$ copies of a bosonic passive Gaussian state, prepares $n$ copies of one of its randomly chosen Gaussian purifications. The construction has the additional advantage that each purification has a mean photon number which is exactly twice that of the initial state. Our construction relies on the characterisation of the commutant of passive Gaussian unitaries via the representation theory of dual reductive pairs of unitary groups.</p>

            <h2>Cartesian-nj: Extending e3nn to Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Product and Contracion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zemin Xu, Chenyu Wu, Wenbo Xie, Daiqian Xie, P. Hu</p>
            <p>Equivariant atomistic machine learning models have brought substantial gains in both extrapolation capability and predictive accuracy. Depending on the basis of the space, two distinct types of irreducible representations are utilized. From architectures built upon spherical tensors (STs) to more recent formulations employing irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs), STs have remained dominant owing to their compactness, elegance, and theoretical completeness. Nevertheless, questions have persisted regarding whether ST constructions are the only viable design principle, motivating continued development of Cartesian networks. In this work, we introduce the Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbol, which serve as direct analogues of the Wigner-3j and Wigner-nj symbol defined for tensor coupling. These coefficients enable the combination of any two ICTs into a new ICT. Building on this foundation, we extend e3nn to support irreducible Cartesian tensor product, and we release the resulting Python package as cartnn. Within this framework, we implement Cartesian counterparts of MACE, NequIP, and Allegro, allowing the first systematic comparison of Cartesian and spherical models to assess whether Cartesian formulations may offer advantages under specific conditions. Using TACE as a representative example, we further examine whether architectures constructed from irreducible Cartesian tensor product and contraction(ICTP and ICTC) are conceptually well-founded in Cartesian space and whether opportunities remain for improving their design.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Hart, David T. Stephen, Evan Wickenden, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>Contextuality is arguably the fundamental property that makes quantum mechanics different from classical physics. It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certainty when performing single-site Pauli measurements on a state that is a codeword of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting quantum code. We show that these games require deterministic computation of a code-dependent Boolean function, and that the classical probability of success is upper bounded by a generalized notion of nonlinearity/nonquadraticity. This success probability quantifies the state's contextuality, and is computed via the function's (generalized) Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. To calculate this, we introduce an efficient, many-body-physics-inspired method that involves identifying the symmetries of an auxiliary hypergraph state. We compute the classical probability of success for several paradigmatic CSS codes and relate it to both classical statistical mechanics models and to strange correlators of symmetry-protected topological states. We also consider CSS submeasurement games, which can only be won with certainty by sharing the appropriate codeword up to local isometries. These games therefore enable self-testing, which we illustrate explicitly for the 2D toric code. We also discuss how submeasurement games enable an extensive notion of contextuality in many-body states.</p>

Our claim is substantiated by analytic and numerical approach.

            <p>There has been considerable effort to mimic analog black holes and wormholes in solid state systems. Lattice realizations in particular present specific challenges. One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is "trans-Planckian", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior.</p>

            <h2>Paramagnon-Interference Mechanism for Three-Dimensional Bond Order in Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K): Analysis by the Density-Wave Equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seiichiro Onari, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models of kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed, since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. Based on the analysis of the DW equation, by taking into account a finite third-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) term, (i) shift stacking $2\times 2\times 2$ BO can be realized via a first-order transition below $T_{\rm BO}$. Here, the in-plane BO pattern (tri-hexagonal or star-of-David) is determined by the sign of the third-order GL term, with hole doping tending to favor the tri-hexagonal state. On the other hand, if the third-order GL term is very small, (ii) alternating vertical stacking BO may instead be realized via a second-order transition. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longju Yu, Hong Jian Zhao, Yurong Yang, Laurent Bellaiche, Yanming Ma</p>
            <p>The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a topology-related transport phenomenon being of potential interest in spintronics, because this effect enables the efficient probe of magnetic orders (i.e., data readout in memory devices). It is well known that AHE spontaneously occurs in ferromagnets or antiferromagnets with magnetization. While recent studies reveal electric-field induced AHE (via linear magnetoelectric coupling), an AHE originating from {\it nonlinear} magnetoelectric coupling remains largely unexplored. Here, by symmetry analysis, we establish the phenomenological theory regarding the spontaneous and electric-field driven AHE in magnets. We show that a large variety of magnetic point groups host an AHE that is driven by uni-axial, bi-axial, or tri-axial electric field and that comes from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling. Such electric-field driven anomalous Hall conductivities are reversible by reversing the magnetic orders. Furthermore, our first-principles calculations suggest Cr$_2$O$_3$ and CoF$_2$ as candidates hosting the aforementioned AHE. Our work emphasizes the important role of nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling in creating exotic transport phenomena, and offers alternative avenues for the probe of magnetic orders.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE-resistant alloys.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Mirone, Mauro Rovezzi, Christoph Sahle, Alessandro Longo</p>
            <p>We introduce an active-space embedding framework for core-level spectroscopies that connects localized atomic multiplets to continuum resonances within a plane-wave DFT/PAW description. The approach is complementary to widely used core-level Bethe--Salpeter implementations based on a two-particle (core-exciton) picture with typically static screening: here a correlated multiplet manifold of the absorber (including the core hole and open-shell configurations) is coherently coupled to a plane-wave photoelectron, enabling a unified treatment of localized multiplet structure and continuum lineshapes. Spectra are computed in a general time-domain formulation equivalent to Fermi's golden rule: a transition operator tailored to the specific spectroscopy technique is applied to the correlated ground state to generate an excited wavepacket, and the corresponding wavepacket autocorrelation function is evaluated without explicit real-time propagation, using Lanczos tridiagonalization or the kernel polynomial method; the spectral intensity follows from its Fourier representation. We validate the method at the Ce \(N_{4,5}\) edges, reproducing in quantitative agreement with experiment both high-\(Q\) multiplet features and the low-\(Q\) giant dipole resonance continuum, including a characteristic low-energy shoulder relevant for robust Ce valence assignments. The implementation is available open-source within the Quantum ESPRESSO XSPECTRA package (xspectruplet mode), together with reproducible inputs and scripts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longju Yu, Hong Jian Zhao, Laurent Bellaiche, Yanming Ma</p>
            <p>Magnetic or electrical manipulation of electronic spin is elementary for spin-based logic, computing, and memory, where the latter is a low-power manipulation scheme. Rashba-like spin splittings stemming from spin-orbit interaction (SOI) enable electric-field manipulation of spin, but the relativistic SOI causes spin relaxations and yields dissipative transport of spin-encoded information. Recent works suggest the occurrence of electric-field switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings (NRZSSs) in collinear antiferromagnets -- allowing for electrical manipulation of spin in the non-relativistic regime; yet, a theory elucidating the mechanisms for these NRZSSs and guiding the materials discovery remains missing. Here, we develop such a theory by analyzing the symmetries of spin point groups. We highlight the linear magnetoelectric and bilinear piezomagnetoelectric mechanisms for NRZSSs that depend linearly on electric field and are electrically switchable. First-principles calculations further confirm that FeOOH and NaMnP showcase such NRZSSs. Our theory provides guidelines for discovering light-element collinear antiferromagnets with electrically switchable NRZSSs, which are promising for the design of high-performance spin-based devices.</p>

            <p>PL5 and PL6 centers in 4H-SiC are promising for quantum applications due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection were insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this work, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5/PL6 at the single-defect level, definitively ruling out any spatial correlation and demonstrating that these centers are not associated with stacking faults. Furthermore, we find that substituting oxygen for nitrogen in ion implantation enhances the yields of PL5 and PL6 by more than $11$-fold and $23$-fold, respectively. Single-spin ODMR spectroscopy of PL5 reveals six distinct orientations, determines the transverse zero-field splitting parameter $E$, and characterizes the hyperfine coupling. Combined with our ab initio calculations, these results provide compelling evidence for the assignment of PL5 as an OV($kh$) defect, consisting of an oxygen atom occupying the C($k$) site as the nearest neighbor to a Si($h$) vacancy. The structural analysis together with the demonstrated defect yield enhancement lays the foundation for fabricating high-sensitivity, high-contrast ensemble quantum sensors in two and three dimensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Trushin</p>
            <p>Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) can be understood as two-dimensional light confined to a conductor-dielectric interface via plasmonic excitations. While low-energy SPPs behave similarly to photons, higher-frequency SPPs resemble surface plasmons. Electrically generating mid-range SPPs is particularly challenging because it requires compensating for momentum mismatch, a process conventionally achieved through inelastic electron transport in nanostructures. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that electrical SPP generation is possible by directly coupling electron-hole dipoles to the quantized SPP field across an insulating spacer without accompanying electron transport. This approach can be realized in plasmonic van der Waals heterostructures composed of strongly-biased monolayer graphene as the emitter, few-layer hexagonal boron nitride as the spacer, and silver (or gold) as the plasmonic material. In this configuration, graphene's remarkable ability to support a strongly non-equilibrium steady-state electron-hole population results in non-thermal, bias-tunable SPP emission that is uniform along the hBN/Ag interface, achieving a power conversion efficiency of up to 1% and a Purcell factor of up to 100. These findings pave the way for integrating photonic and electronic functionalities within a single two-dimensional heterostructure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Dolgushev, Olivier Bénichou</p>
            <p>The analysis of local minima in time series data and random landscapes is essential across numerous scientific disciplines, offering critical insights into system dynamics. Recently, Kundu, Majumdar, and Schehr derived the exact distribution of the number of local minima for a broad class of Markovian symmetric walks [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{110}, 024137 (2024)]; however, many real-world systems are non-Markovian, typically due to interactions with possibly hidden degrees of freedom. This work investigates the statistical properties of local minima in discrete-time samples of fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a non-Markovian Gaussian process with stationary increments, widely used to model complex, anomalous diffusion phenomena. We derive a complete asymptotic characterization of the fluctuations of the number of local minima $m_N$ in an $N$-step discrete-time fBm. We show that the fluctuations of $m_N$ exhibit a sharp transition at the Hurst exponent $H=3/4$: for $H\le 3/4$ they satisfy a central limit theorem with Gaussian limiting law, whereas for $H>3/4$ they converge to a non-Gaussian Rosenblatt process. The convergence at the process level gives us full statistical description at all times. We exemplify it on the covariance of the rescaled minima process, which displays two qualitatively distinct regimes matching Brownian and Rosenblatt covariances on either side of this threshold. Our analysis relies on a Hermite/Wick decomposition of the local-minimum indicator, which isolates a quadratic functional of an effective long-memory mode as the unique driver of the anomalous statistics. These results identify the count of local minima as a simple and robust diagnostic of long-range dependence in non-Markovian Gaussian processes, a conclusion supported by numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>The Kondo effect originates from the spin exchange scattering of itinerant electrons with a localized magnetic impurity. Here, we consider generalization of Weyl-type electrons with their spin locked on a spherical Fermi surface in an arbitrary way and study how such spin-momentum locking affects the Kondo effect. After introducing a suitable model Hamiltonian, a simple formula for the Kondo temperature is derived with the second-order perturbation theory, which proves to depend only on the spin averaged over the Fermi surface. In particular, the Kondo temperature is unaffected as long as the average spin vanishes, but decreases as the average spin increases in its magnitude, and eventually vanishes when the spin is completely polarized on the Fermi surface, illuminating the role of spin-momentum locking in the Kondo effect.</p>

            <p>Recently, altermagnetic materials have become rather attractive because such materials showcase combined advantages of ferromagnets (e.g., spin current) and antiferromagnets (e.g., low stray field and ultrafast spin dynamics). Symmetry arguments imply that $d$-wave altermagnets may host strain-induced nonrelativistic Zeeman-type spin splittings (ZSSs), and a theoretical, numerical, and experimental justification of such phenomena are of high necessity. In the present work, we work with collinear spin point groups (SPGs) and use symmetry analysis to identify 15 SPGs that host strain-induced nonrelativistic ZSSs. These 15 SPGs coincide with the cases associated with $d$-wave alternating spin splittings reported in literature. We further corroborate our analysis by first-principles numerical simulations, which indicate that a shear strain of $2\%$ creates sizable nonrelativistic ZSSs of up to 177, 100, and 102 meV in CoF$_2$, LiFe$_2$F$_6$ and La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$ $d$-wave altermagnetic semiconductors, respectively. Our work suggests an alternative route toward creating spin current in altermagnets, which may be used to design altermagnetic-based spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Seyedi, Alex Albaugh</p>
            <p>Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs) are a novel class of polymer structures in which the components are connected by mechanical bonds instead of covalent bonds. We measure the single-molecule rheological properties of polyrotaxanes, daisy chains, and polycatenanes under steady shear and steady uniaxial extension using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations with hydrodynamic interactions. We obtain key rheological features, including tumbling dynamics, molecular extension, stress, and viscosity. By systematically varying structural features, we demonstrate how MIP topology governs flow response. Compared to linear polymers, all three MIP architectures exhibit enhanced tumbling in shear flow and lower normal stress differences in extensional flow. While polyrotaxanes show higher shear and extensional viscosities, polycatenanes and daisy chains have lower viscosities. In extensional flow, polyrotaxanes and polycatenanes extend earlier than linear polymers. We find that mechanical bonds suppress shear thinning and alter the coil-stretch transition observed in linear polymers. These effects arise from the mechanically bonded rings in MIPs, which expand the polymer profile in gradient direction and increase backbone stiffness due to ring-backbone repulsions. This study provides key insights into MIP flow properties, providing the foundation for their systematic development in engineering applications.</p>

            <p>Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.</p>

            <p>Accurate quantification of the energy distribution of backscattered electrons (BSEs) contributing to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns remains as an active challenge. This study introduces an energy-resolved EBSD methodology based on a monolithic active pixel sensor direct electron detector and an electron-counting algorithm to enable the energy quantification of individual BSEs, providing direct measurements of electron energy spectra within diffraction patterns. Following detector calibration of the detector signal as a function of primary beam energy, measurements using a 12 keV primary beam on Si(100) reveal a broad BSE energy distribution across the diffraction pattern, extending down to 3 keV. Furthermore, an angular dependence in the weighted average BSE energy is observed, closely matching predictions from Monte Carlo simulations. Pixel-resolved energy maps reveal subtle modulations at Kikuchi band edges, offering insights into the backscattering process. By applying energy filtering within spectral windows as narrow as 2 keV centered on the primary beam energy, significant enhancement in pattern clarity and high-frequency detail is observed. Notably, BSEs in the 9--10 keV range dominate Kikuchi pattern formation, while BSEs in the 2--8 keV range, despite having undergone substantial energy loss, still produce Kikuchi patterns. By enabling energy determination at the single-electron level, this approach introduces a versatile tool-set for expanding the quantitative capabilities of EBSD, thereby offering the potential to deepen the understanding of diffraction contrast mechanisms and to advance the precision of crystallographic measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amichay Vardi, Doron Cohen</p>
            <p>We consider a minimal model for quantum thermalization of coupled chaotic subsystems. The route towards ergodicity is explored as a function of the coupling strength. The results are contrasted with the predictions of standard Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and the Eigenstates Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We highlight a coupling regime of disparity between the spectral statistics that indicates chaos, and ergodicity measures that indicate lack of ETH thermalization. The analysis involves a revision of the energy shell concept, in a way that is consistent but independent of the semiclassical perspective.</p>

            <h2>Almost half-quantized planar Hall effects in $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Motohiko Ezawa</p>
            <p>The planar Hall effect is a phenomenon that the Hall conductivity emerges perpendicular to the electric field in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. We investigate the planar Hall effect in two-dimensional metal coupled with higher symmetric $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$,\ where those with $X=d,g,i$ are altermagnets. The $X$-wave magnet is characterized by the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes in the band structure, where $N_{X}=1,2,3,4,6$ corresponding to $X=p,d,f,g,i$. Although the system is metallic, provided the Dirac gap is tiny, we demonstrate that the Hall conductivities are almost half quantized and well approximated by the formula $\sigma _{xy}=\pm (e^{2}/2h)$ sgn$\left( J\sin N_{X}\Phi \right) $, where $J$ is the coefficient of the coupling between the $X$-wave magnet and the electrons, and $\Phi $ is the direction of the applied magnetic field. Hence, the Hall conductivity is periodic in $\Phi $, and the periodicity is equal to the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes. This property may be used to confirm that the target material is indeed an $X $-wave magnet. Furthermore, the sign of $J$ may be used as a bit for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p>

The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces.

We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk.</p>

            <h2>Quantum diatomic chain: a supersolid structure in three-component Bose mixture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ancilotto</p>
            <p>The formation and properties of a supersolid structure in a three-component ultracold Bose gas mixture at T=0 are investigated theoretically. The system consists of 23Na, 39K, and 41K atomic species, in which the binary mixtures of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) can form self-bound quantum droplets stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Two such droplets can bind together by the shared 39K component, forming a stable "dimer" structure, which displays vibrational modes analogous to a classical diatomic molecule. A simple protocol is proposed to create a stable linear chain formed by periodic repetition of this basic building block, i.e. an alternating sequence of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) droplets. This structure exhibits both periodic density modulations from the droplet ordering and global phase coherence due to the shared 39K component, satisfying the criteria for supersolidity. This expands the class of known supersolids by adding a system where mediated binding, rather than intrinsic long-range interactions or engineered band-structures as in previously known supersolids, is the key organizing principle, thereby offering new directions for both theory and experiment. The low-energy excitation spectrum, probed by density perturbations, identifies modes corresponding to droplet vibrations close to the ones expected from a classical diatomic chain, coexisting with low-energy superfluid (Goldstone-type) modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. V. Duc Pham, Nicki F. Hinsche, Ingrid Mertig</p>
            <p>Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome and snub square lattices, the simplest members of the Archimedean lattice family, have been extensively investigated -- the former as a paradigmatic system for geometric frustration and nontrivial band topology, and the latter primarily as a quasicrystal approximant -- the broader family remains largely unexplored in terms of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic Python-based tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, modeled as two-dimensional carbon-based networks serving as a proof-of-principle system. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and give rise to quantized spin Hall currents.</p>

            <p>We apply perturbation theory of boundary conditions, originally developed by A.B. Migdal and independently by S.A. Moszkowski for deformed atomic nuclei, to finding eigenfrequencies of Raman-active spheroidal modes of a spheroid from these of a sphere and compare the outcomes with the results of numerical calculations for CdSe and silver nanoparticles. The modes are characterized by the total angular momentum $j=2$ and are five-fold degenerate for a sphere but split into three distinct modes, characterized by the absolute value of the total angular momentum projection onto the spheroidal axis, in case of a spheroid. The perturbation method works well in case of the rigid boundary conditions, with the displacement field set to zero at the boundary, and accurately predicts the splittings when the spheroidal shape is close to a sphere, but fails in case of the stress-free boundary conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Wang, K. Levin</p>
            <p>While it has been one of the most important new physics discoveries in the last decade, the nature of superconductivity in the twisted graphene family remains an unsolved problem. Motivated by recent scanning tunneling experiments that report Kekulé ordering in moiré graphene superconductors, we develop a microscopic theory of this superconductivity for the twisted bilayer system. The pairing we find is an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) that intrinsically carries a Kekulé modulation. This state exhibits four salient features: (i) spontaneous breaking of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, producing nematic order (ii)with triplet pairing; and (iii) a quasiparticle density of states that evolves from a V-shaped profile to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum as the attraction increases which is accompanied by (iv) systematic behavior of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance. These features align with key experimental signatures. We find, as well, that with only modest interaction strengths, the state is near to a BEC-like phase, consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Taken together, these results identify a microscopic intra-valley Kekulé PDW as a compelling candidate for unconventional superconductivity in the twisted graphene family.</p>

            <p>Universal machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as efficient tools for materials simulation, yet their reliability for elastic property prediction remains unclear. Here, we present a systematic benchmark of four uMLIPs -- MatterSim, MACE, SevenNet, and CHGNet -- against first-principles data for nearly 11\,000 elastically stable materials from the Materials Project database. The results show that SevenNet achieves the highest accuracy, MACE and MatterSim balance accuracy with efficiency, while CHGNet performs less effectively overall. To further improve predictive quality, we perform targeted fine-tuning on all four uMLIPs using strained configurations derived from 185 high-error materials. After fine-tuning, CHGNet exhibits the largest overall improvement, with an average mean absolute percentage error reduction of about 23\%, followed by MatterSim at around 21\% and SevenNet at 18\%, whereas MACE shows a performance degradation of roughly 14\%. This work provides quantitative guidance for model selection and data refinement, advancing uMLIPs toward reliable applications in mechanical property prediction.</p>

            <h2>From Three-Particle Dynamics to the Structural Origin of the Arrow of Time in Classical and Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuhei Kobayashi</p>
            <p>This paper presents a unified formulation of the origin of the arrow of time in classical and quantum mechanics. We begin with a mechanical analysis of a one-dimensional three-particle system, which provides a concrete example in which macroscopic irreversibility emerges despite microscopically reversible dynamics. By abstracting this mechanism, we identify coarse-graining as the essential ingredient responsible for macroscopic time asymmetry. We then formulate a general structural criterion for the thermodynamic arrow of time. We show that when microscopic time evolution forms a group while the induced macroscopic evolution forms only a semigroup, macroscopic time-reversal symmetry is necessarily broken. We prove that this semigroup structure arises if and only if the coarse-graining map from microscopic to macroscopic states is non-injective. This result holds independently of whether the underlying system is classical or quantum. In the quantum case, using density matrices, antiunitary time reversal, and CPTP coarse-graining maps, we show that macroscopic irreversibility follows inevitably from information loss, without requiring any asymmetry in the microscopic laws. Our results demonstrate that the thermodynamic arrow of time has a universal structural origin: the loss of microscopic information inherent in coarse-graining.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Peng Wang, Chuo-Kai Chang, Ryo Okugawa, Chen-Hsuan Hsu</p>
            <p>We analyze the localization behavior in a non-Hermitian system subject to a quasiperiodic onsite potential. We characterize localization transitions using multiple quantitative indicators, including inverse participation ratio (IPR), eigenstate fractal dimension (EFD), extended eigenstate ratio (EER), and spectral survival ratio. Despite the breaking of self-dual symmetry due to non-Hermiticity, our results reveal the existence of a critical potential strength, with its value increasing linearly with the nearest-neighbor antisymmetric hopping term. On the other hand, the inclusion of longer-range hopping not only enriches the topological properties but also gives rise to novel localization phenomena. In particular, it induces the emergence of mobility edges, as evidenced by both IPR and EFD, along with distinct features in the spectrum fractal dimension, which we extract using the box-counting method applied to the complex energy spectrum. Additionally, we uncover self-similar structures in various quantities, such as EER and complex eigenvalue ratio, as the potential strength varies. These findings highlight important aspects of localization and fractal phenomena in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong-Kun Wang, Shifeng Qian, An-Dong Fan, Si Li</p>
            <p>Altermagnets, recently identified as a third class of collinear magnetic materials, have attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics. Despite this growing interest, the realization of real Chern insulators in intrinsic altermagnetic systems has rarely been reported. In this work, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we identify monolayer Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O as a novel class of two-dimensional altermagnetic real Chern insulators. We demonstrate that these materials possess altermagnetic ground states and host a nontrivial mirror real Chern number, leading to the emergence of symmetry-protected zero-dimensional corner states. Notably, these corner modes are spin-polarized, giving rise to a unique spin-corner coupling effect. We further show that the real Chern insulating phases and their associated corner states remain robust against spin-orbit coupling, as well as under both uniaxial and biaxial strain. Additionally, these materials exhibit pronounced linear dichroism and strong optical absorption. Our findings uncover the novel topological character of Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O, establishing them as promising platforms for exploring real Chern insulators in altermagnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Local Geometric and Transport Properties of Networks that are Generated from Hyperuniform Point Patterns</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James V. Raj, Xiaohan Sun, Charles Emmett Maher, Katherine A. Newhall, Mason A. Porter</p>
            <p>Hyperuniformity, which is a type of long-range order that is characterized by the suppression of long-range density fluctuations in comparison to the fluctuations in standard disordered systems, has emerged as a powerful concept to aid in the understanding of diverse natural and engineered phenomena. In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller total effective resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. Moreover, HuPPI networks are consistently more robust under both random edge removals and curvature-based targeted edge removals, maintaining larger connected components for larger fractions of removed edges than their PoPPI counterparts. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns.</p>

            <p>Moiré patterns are a central motif in van der Waals heterostructures arising from the superposition of two-dimensional (2D) incommensurate lattices. These patterns reveal a wealth of correlated effects, influencing electronic, magnetic, and structural phenomena. While diffraction techniques typically resolve multiple moiré wave-vectors corresponding to the incommensurate nature of the underlying lattices, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) often reveals only a dominant superperiod. In this work, we address this apparent discrepancy through an STM study of a twisted monolayer of CrCl3 on Au(111). We observe the coexistence of several moiré patterns at a fixed twist angle, whose relative intensity depends on the tunneling bias. Fourier analysis of STM data uncovers hidden higher-order moiré components not visible in STM topographic images, while spectroscopy maps reveal that the spectral weight of each pattern varies with electron energy. Our results establish that STM selectively probes on the same area distinct moiré modulations depending on electronic confinement, providing a unified framework that reconciles real space and reciprocal space observations of complex moiré superstructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Miyazaki, Shiori Tanigawa, Giacomo Marmorini, Nobuo Furukawa, Daisuke Yamamoto</p>
            <p>We propose a method to determine the quantum phase boundaries of one-dimensional systems using sine-square deformation (SSD). Based on the proposition, supported by several exactly solved cases though not proven in full generality, that "if a one-dimensional system is gapless, then the expectation value of any local observable in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with SSD exhibits translational symmetry in the thermodynamic limit," we determine the quantum critical point as the location where a local observable becomes site-independent, identified through finite-size scaling analysis. As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation. Because multiple independent scaling conditions naturally emerge, our approach enables precise determination of quantum critical points and possibly even the extraction of additional critical phenomena, such as critical exponents, from relatively small system sizes.</p>

These are used to compare the CE results with those obtained using the Boltzmann formalism, the Migdal approximation, and its self consistent extension-approaches that are presently the most commonly employed alternatives for transport calculations. Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results. In the case of the Peierls model, the role of vertex corrections is also discussed.</p>

            <p>We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n < 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.</p>

These, however, are simply different sides of the same coin. Our goal with this tutorial is to provide a unified toolbox for describing current fluctuations. This not only provides novel insights, by bringing together different fields in physics, but also yields various analytical and numerical tools for computing quantities of interest. We illustrate our results with various pedagogical examples, and connect them with topical fields of research, such as waiting-time statistics, quantum metrology, thermodynamic uncertainty relations, quantum point contacts and Maxwell's demons.</p>

            <p>Floquet quantum circuits are able to realise a wide range of non-equilibrium quantum states, exhibiting quantum chaos, topological order and localisation. In this work, we investigate the stability of operator localisation and emergence of chaos in random Floquet-Clifford circuits subjected to unitary perturbations which drive them away from the Clifford limit. We construct a nearest-neighbour Clifford circuit with a brickwork pattern and study the effect of including disordered non-Clifford gates. The perturbations are uniformly sampled from single-qubit unitaries with probability $p$ on each qubit. We show that the interacting model exhibits strong localisation of operators for $0 \le p < 1$ that is characterised by the fragmentation of operator space into disjoint sectors due to the appearance of wall configurations. Such walls give rise to emergent local integrals of motion for the circuit that we construct exactly. We analytically establish the stability of localisation against generic perturbations and calculate the average length of operator spreading tunable by $p$. Although our circuit is not separable across any bi-partition, we further show that the operator localisation leads to an entanglement bottleneck, where initially unentangled states remain weakly entangled across typical fragment boundaries. Finally, we study the spectral form factor (SFF) to characterise the chaotic properties of the operator fragments and spectral fluctuations as a probe of non-ergodicity. In the $p = 1$ model, the emergence of a fragmentation time scale is found before random matrix theory sets in after which the SFF can be approximated by that of the circular unitary ensemble. Our work provides an explicit description of quantum phases in operator dynamics and circuit ergodicity which can be realised on current NISQ devices.</p>

We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.</p>

            <p>Unlike other quantum hardware, photonic quantum architectures can produce millions of qubits from a single device. However, controlling photonic qubits remains challenging, even at small scales, due to their weak interactions, making non-deterministic gates in linear optics unavoidable. Nevertheless, a single photon can readily spread over multiple modes and create entanglement within the multiple modes deterministically. Rudolph's concept of third quantization leverages this feature by evolving multiple single-photons into multiple modes, distributing them uniformly and randomly to different parties, and creating multipartite entanglement without interactions between photons or non-deterministic gates. This method requires only classical communication and deterministic entanglement within multi-mode single-photon states and enables universal quantum computing. The multipartite entanglement generated within the third quantization framework is nearly deterministic, where ``deterministic'' is achieved in the asymptotic limit of a large system size. In this work, we propose a near-term experiment using antimony donor in a silicon chip to realize third quantization. Utilizing the eight energy levels of antimony, one can generate two eight-mode single-photon states independently and distribute them to parties. This enables a random multipartite Bell-state experiment, achieving a Bell state with an upper-bound efficiency of 87.5% among 56 random pairs without non-deterministic entangling gates. This approach opens alternative pathways for silicon-based photonic quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Sylos Labini</p>
            <p>Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with { varying resolutions and box sizes}, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher information as a witness of non-Markovianity and criticality in the spin-boson model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Parlato, Grazia Di Bello, Fabrizio Pavan, Giulio De Filippis, Carmine Antonio Perroni</p>
            <p>The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. We also point out that the static quantum Fisher information exhibits a non-perturbative behavior in the zero-coupling limit, which we justify with an analytic argument. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Decay of two-dimensional superfluid turbulence over pinning surface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Novotný, Marek Talíř, Emil Varga</p>
            <p>We report on the free decay of quasi-two-dimensional turbulence in superfluid $^4$He confined within nanofluidic channels. Using a pump-probe technique, we observe a complex decay of the vortex density $L(t)$ that deviates from a simple power law. The decay exhibits a universal fast transient, scaling as $L\propto t^{-2}$, followed by a slower non-universal regime that depends on the geometry and flow conditions. We demonstrate that this behavior is governed by the interplay between vortex pinning on the disordered topography of the channel walls and the mobilizing effect of the weak probe flow. A numerical model that treats pinning as a velocity-dependent effective mutual friction successfully reproduces the essential features of our experimental observations.</p>

            <h2>TACE: A unified Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Framework for Atomistic Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zemin Xu, Wenbo Xie, Daiqian Xie, P. Hu</p>
            <p>Here, we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion (TACE), a unified framework formulated entirely in Cartesian space, enabling systematic and consistent prediction of arbitrary structure-dependent tensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments into a complete hierarchy of irreducible Cartesian tensors, ensuring symmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and equivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal embeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including computational levels, charges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control over external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range interactions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation module within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet computationally efficient treatment of electrostatic and dispersion effects. We demonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with or surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and extended materials. This includes in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra, Hessian, external-field responses, charged and magnetic systems, multi-fidelity training, heterogeneous catalysis, and even superior performance within the uMLIP benchmark. Crucially, TACE bridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space paradigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of spherical-tensor-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new generation of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of systematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material properties within a single coherent framework.</p>

            <p>Nonthermal attractors govern the emergent self-similar dynamics of far-from-equilibrium quantum systems, from ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions to cold-atom experiments. Within the framework of adiabatic hydrodynamization, the approach to a nonthermal attractor is described by the decay of excited states of an effective Hamiltonian. Using an exactly solvable kinetic theory -- the longitudinally expanding, overoccupied gluon plasma dominated by small-angle elastic scattering -- we establish a direct correspondence between the eigenmodes of adiabatic hydrodynamization and the quasinormal mode spectrum of the nonthermal attractor. This equivalence suggests a general framework for identifying universal dynamical structures in nonequilibrium systems. As a byproduct, we derive analytic prescaling solutions for strongly longitudinally expanding systems.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character - which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements - and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum's Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Variational Method in Quantum Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Hutsalyuk, Márton Lájer, Giuseppe Mussardo, Andrea Stampiggi</p>
            <p>We develop a variational framework for addressing two-dimensional non-integrable quantum field theories through the exact structure of their integrable counterparts. Concentrating on the $\varphi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg model, we use the analytical Vacuum Expectation Values and Form Factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory as the foundation of a variational ansatz. In this way, we obtain controlled estimates of central physical quantities of the $\varphi^4$ theory - such as the finite-volume ground-state energy and the physical mass as a function of the coupling constant. The strengths of the variational methods are leveraged in combination with the Hamiltonian truncation techniques and the LeClair-Mussardo formula, which also allow to probe the accuracy of the variational approximation varying the system size. Within the weak-coupling regime, a detailed numerical analysis reveals the behaviour of the finite-volume spectrum, the ground-state energy, and the elastic part of the scattering matrix, showing how the rigorous machinery of integrable models can serve as a guiding light into the complex landscape of non-integrable quantum field dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Li, Yuhui Li, Jianzhao Wu, Luxuan Zhang, Maoyuan Li, Chaochao Wu, Zhenzhong Wang</p>
            <p>Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.</p>

            <h2>Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang Hoon Lee</p>
            <p>The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.</p>

            <h2>Extended regime of nematic order in an interacting monomer-dimer model of Heilmann and Lieb</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qidong He</p>
            <p>We revisit a two-dimensional model of liquid crystals introduced by Heilmann and Lieb (1979), which consists of a system of dimers on the square lattice at chemical potential $\lambda$, interacting via a hard-core repulsion and an attractive interaction of strength $-a<0$ between adjacent, colinear dimers. The model is conjectured to exhibit nematic order at low temperatures, in the sense of orientational symmetry breaking coupled with the absence of translational order, provided that $\lambda+a>0$. In this paper, we prove the conjecture under the additional condition that $3a>\lambda$, which corresponds physically to the regime where vacancies, as opposed to misaligned dimers, are the dominant mechanism for decorrelation, significantly extending the parameter regime under which the conjecture is known to hold. Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order. To deal with the non-nearest neighbor interactions in the model, we also introduce an extension of the chessboard estimate applicable to finite products of periodic Gibbs measures.</p>

We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</p>

            <p>Fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix respond differently to manufacturing conditions due to mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion and matrix shrinkage during curing of thermosets. These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites.</p>

            <p>Decisive experimental confirmation of the $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid phase in quantum spin ice remains an outstanding challenge. In this work, we propose stray-field magnetometry as a direct probe of the emergent photons -- the gapless excitation of the emergent electrodynamics in quantum spin ice. The emergent photons are transverse magnetization waves, which, in a finite sample, form discrete modes governed by one of two sets of natural boundary conditions: ``insulating'' or ``superconducting''. Considering cavity and thin film geometries, we find that the spectrum and spatial structure of the stray magnetic noise provide a sharp qualitative signature of the underlying electrodynamics. The predicted stray-field noise power lies comfortably within the detection range of present-day solid-state defect magnetometry.</p>

The later allow us to discern the presence or not of the Zitterbewegung oscillations by simply analyzing the spin or pseudo-spin textures. We provide examples of the applicability of our approach for Hamiltonian models that show the suppression of specific Zitterbewegung oscillations.</p>

            <p>The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.</p>

            <p>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, a lattice analogue of fractional quantum Hall effect, offers a unique pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation and deep insights into the interplay of topology and strong correlations. The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general.</p>

            <p>We study impacts of spin-orbit interactions on the spin susceptibility in quasicrystal superconductors, motivated by the anomolous superconducting properties in the van der Waals quasicrystal Ta$_{1.6}$Te under magnetic fields. We consider the Penrose tiling model with $s$-wave pairing as a representative system and include anisotropic spin-orbit interactions allowed for the quasicrystal structure. It is shown that the spin-momentum locking locally takes place in the quasicrystal, and electron motion and spin directions are tightly connected at each spatial position in the real space. As a result, the spin susceptibility is enhanced for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields in the presence of a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. For an Ising-type spin-orbit interaction, the spin susceptibility only for in-plane magnetic fields is increased, while the out-of-plane spin susceptibility is almost unchanged. When there are both kinds of the spin-orbit interactions, temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility for any field directions is suppressed.</p>

            <p>Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.</p>

            <p>Kapitza-Dirac scattering, the diffraction of matter waves from a standing light field, is widely utilized in ultracold gases, but its behavior in the strongly interacting regime is an open question. Here we develop a numerically-exact two-body description of Kapitza-Dirac scattering for two contact-interacting atoms in a one-dimensional harmonic trap subjected to a pulsed optical lattice, enabling us to obtain the numerically exact dynamics. We map how interaction strength, lattice depth, lattice wavenumber, and pulse duration reshape the diffraction pattern, leading to an interaction-dependent population redistribution in real and momentum-space. By comparing the exact dynamics to an impulsive sudden-approximation description, we delineate the parameter regimes where it remains accurate and those, notably at strong attraction and small lattice wavenumber, where it fails. Our results provide a controlled few-body benchmark for interacting Kapitza-Dirac scattering and quantitative guidance for Kapitza-Dirac-based probes of ultracold atomic systems.</p>

Here, we extend Bloch's theorem to crystals under the strong light-matter coupling, showing that polariton quasiparticles preserve lattice periodicity. We formulate a general framework to incorporate the effect of multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way. We find that the additional modes contribute to the system's energy by small modifications that become noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation the multimode contribution manifests as a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal's plane. This provides a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics. This work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework that clarifies how polaritonic states in crystalline solids should be described.</p>

            <p>Polariton condensation is a potential system state for performing analog computations, given that it exhibits quantum behavior at macroscopic scales readily probed with low-cost optical methods. Current methods of fabricating devices in polariton microcavities largely involve patterning the devices via e-beam lithography before the cavity is completed, which offers less flexibility in device creation and reduces the maximum possible refractive index contrast. Moreover, the momentum and spatial distributions of the condensate are highly dependent on the host platform, and it has been difficult to preserve the desired behavior when modifying a given cavity. Here we introduce a method that addresses both of these challenges with the creation of polaritonic circuits of arbitrary forms etched via Focused Ion Beam into an organic microcavity based on Rhodamine 3B Perchlorate within a Small Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices complex. We demonstrate room temperature condensation and propagation of polaritons in rectangular and trapezoidal waveguides by analyzing spatial and angle-resolved photoluminescence. We also discuss the blue-shifting and non-zero momentum of the condensate and show that it is strongly confined up to several higher energy levels. As an example, we report the spatial profiles of condensation in custom devices, such as a ring waveguide, a Y-splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

            <p>We provide an exact evaluation of the out-of-time correlation (OTOC) functions for the localized $f$-particle states in the Falicov-Kimball model within dynamical mean-field theory. Different regimes of quantum chaos and quantum scrambling are distinguished by the winding numbers of the block Toeplitz matrices used in the calculation. The similarities of these fermionic OTOCs and their logarithmic derivatives for time evolution with the OTOCs for quantum spin models with disorder are also discussed.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Spin Hall Phase in the Truncated Trihexagonal Lattice: A Topological Archimedean Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. V. Duc Pham, Nicki F. Hinsche, Ingrid Mertig</p>
            <p>Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome and snub square lattices, the simplest members of the Archimedean lattice family, have been extensively investigated -- the former as a paradigmatic system for geometric frustration and nontrivial band topology, and the latter primarily as a quasicrystal approximant -- the broader family remains largely unexplored in terms of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic Python-based tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, modeled as two-dimensional carbon-based networks serving as a proof-of-principle system. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and give rise to quantized spin Hall currents.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Li-Haldane Correspondence in Critical Free-Fermion Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.</p>

            <p>The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Pichler, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Dynamical control of quantum matter is a challenging, yet promising direction for probing strongly correlated states. Motivated by recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$ that demonstrated optical control of magnetization, we propose a protocol for probing magnetization dynamics in flat-band ferromagnets. We investigate the nucleation and dynamical growth of magnetic bubbles prepared on top of a false vaccum in both itinerant ferromagnets and spin-polarized Chern insulators. For ferromagnetic metals, we emphasize the crucial role of a non-trivial quantum geometry in the magnetization dynamics, which in turn also provides a probe for the quantum metric. Furthermore, for quantum Hall ferromagnets, we show how properties of chiral edge modes localized at domain-wall boundaries can be dynamically accessed. Our work demonstrates the potential for nonequilibrium protocols to control and probe strongly correlated phases, with particular relevance for twisted MoTe$_2$ and graphene-based flat-band ferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Yang, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ necessitates a minimal theoretical model that unifies the superconducting phase with the spin-density-wave (SDW) phase without external pressure or strain. We propose a model where half-filled $d_{z^{2}}$ local moments interact with itinerant $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ electrons via strong Hund's coupling $J_H$, which reduces to a bilayer type-II t-J model in the large $J_H$ limit. Using iDMRG calculations on an $L_y=4, L_z=2$ cylinder, we demonstrate that the competition between double-exchange ferromagnetism and in-plane superexchange generates period-4 stripe-like SDW order-a feature absent in one-orbital t-J model with only $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Furthermore, increasing the interlayer exchange coupling suppresses magnetic order and stabilizes interlayer s-wave superconductivity. These results identify the type-II t-J model as a minimal framework for capturing the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p>The nodal surfaces of the many-body wavefunction are fundamental geometric features that encode critical information regarding particle statistics and their interaction. Directly probing these structures, particularly in correlated quantum systems, remains a significant experimental challenge. Here, we provide rigorous results on the structure of the many-body wavefunction and propose to use an interferometric technique to probe its zeros in ultra-cold atomic systems. Specifically, we refer to the so-called heterodyne interferometric reconstruction of the phase of the many-body wavefunction. We prove that the sought nodal surfaces show up as specific discontinuities in the interference fringes. Following Leggett, both `symmetry-dictated' nodal surfaces, due to particle statistics, and `non-symmetry dictated' nodal surfaces emerging from interaction effects, can be probed. We demonstrate how the spin degrees of freedom, effectively modifying the structure of the nodal surfaces of the many-body wavefunction, leave distinct fingerprints in the resulting interference pattern. Our work addresses important features of the structure of the many-body wavefunction that are broadly relevant for quantum science ranging from conceptual aspects to computational questions of extended systems and quantum simulation.</p>

            <p>A third monolayer of tin atoms on the semiconductor substrate Si(111) has been shown to become superconducting upon six to ten percent hole doping. Experiments have reported promising results hinting at a superconducting chiral $d$-wave order parameter. Here we examine Sn/Si(111) by combining most recent ab initio results, quasi-particle interference calculations, state-of-the-art truncated-unity functional renormalization group simulations and Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis. We show remarkable agreement between experimental and theoretical quasi-particle interference data both in the metallic and superconducting regimes. The interacting phase diagram reveals that the superconductivity is indeed chiral $d$-wave with Chern number $C=4$. Surprisingly, magnetically ordered phases are absent, instead we find charge density wave order, as observed in related compounds, as a competing phase. Our results demonstrate that Sn/Si(111) is an outstanding candidate material for chiral topological superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Unreasonable effectiveness of unsupervised learning in identifying Majorana topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Taylor, Haining Pan, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>In unsupervised learning, the training data for deep learning does not come with any labels, thus forcing the algorithm to discover hidden patterns in the data for discerning useful information. This, in principle, could be a powerful tool in identifying topological order since topology does not always manifest in obvious physical ways (e.g., topological superconductivity) for its decisive confirmation. The problem, however, is that unsupervised learning is a difficult challenge, necessitating huge computing resources, which may not always work. In the current work, we combine unsupervised and supervised learning using an autoencoder to establish that unlabeled data in the Majorana splitting in realistic short disordered nanowires may enable not only a distinction between `topological' and `trivial', but also where their crossover happens in the relevant parameter space. This may be a useful tool in identifying topology in Majorana nanowires.</p>

            <p>Shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) represent a paradigmatic instance of quantum fluids in hollow geometries exhibiting phenomena that bridge from ultracold atomic to astrophysical realms. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of the dynamics, thermodynamics, and collective excitations of shell-shaped BECs, synthesizing two decades of our group's theoretical work in light of recent experimental breakthroughs. We begin by analyzing the evolution of a BEC from filled-sphere to hollow-shell geometries, illustrating the necessity of microgravity conditions to avoid gravitational sag. We then analyze collective modes structure across this evolution and pinpoint a universal dip in the frequency spectra as well as mode reconfiguration due to inner-surface excitations as robust signatures of the hollowing-out transition. Turning to vortex physics, we show that the closed-surface topology enforces vortex-antivortex configurations in shell-shaped BECs and that the natural annihilation of these pairs can be stabilized by rotation, with the critical rotation rate depending on shell thickness. In the thermodynamic domain, we investigate the interplay between shell inflation and the BEC phase transition, where adiabatic expansions lead to condensate depletion. This behavior motivates a study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of shell-shaped BECs; we perform such a study by constructing a time-dependent dynamic technique that can capture the evolution in both adiabatice and non-adiabatic regimes. Finally, we review recent experimental realizations of shell-shaped BECs, including the landmark creation of ultracold shells aboard the International Space Station, and outline prospects for exploring quantum fluids in curved geometries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Fitos, G. Takács</p>
            <p>We consider a prime example of simulating interacting relativistic QFT with cold atoms: the realisation of the sine-Gordon model by tunnel-coupled quasi-1D Bose gases. While experiments have shown that it can realise the sine-Gordon model in equilibrium, studies of non-equilibrium dynamics have revealed a phase-locking behaviour that stands in contrast to predictions from sine-Gordon field theory. Here, we examine a one-dimensional field-theoretic model of the system and find that the phase-locking behaviour can be understood in terms of the presence of the longitudinal harmonic trap, and that the additional degrees of freedom known to be present in the experiment do not appear to play a significant role. Therefore, the experimental setup provides a good simulator of the sine-Gordon quantum field theory, even out of equilibrium, if the inhomogeneous background induced by the trap is taken into account. Furthermore, our results support the idea that modifying the longitudinal trap to a box shape should result in agreement with standard sine-Gordon dynamics. The main remaining open issues are to account for 3D corrections and model the effect of the boundaries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frank M. Abel, Paige Burke, Daniel Wines, Brian Donovan, Michelle E. Jamer, Kamal Choudhary</p>
            <p>Automation and high-throughput characterization and synthesis for material development are becoming increasingly common; these approaches require machine learning (ML) tools to assess material properties, ideally based on a single measurement. Here, ML models are developed to predict magnetization from X-ray diffraction (XRD) for iron oxide nanoparticles. Our approach is to first develop a set of simulated data that links modulated XRD, based on a crystallographic information file (CIF), to a simple magnetic model to determine magnetization at a given magnetic field, thereby enabling us to train Random Forest and Gradient Boosting regression models on a large amount of simulated data. The models are validated by synthesizing iron oxide nanoparticles and measuring their crystal structure via XRD and room-temperature magnetization curves. In doing so, we can fine-tune both the training hyperparameters and the optimal size of the simulated datasets used to train the models. Through this optimization, the best models can achieve an $R^2$ greater than 0.9 for five experimental samples, used for tuning, for predicting the max magnetization (at 2.8 T) of the measurement. Lastly, we demonstrate reasonable predictions on the full magnetization vs. magnetic field curve, showing that the RF model excels at predicting the high magnetic field values, which is key for determining the success of an iron oxide nanoparticle synthesis for applications like magnetic particle imaging (MPI), thermal magnetic particle imaging (T-MPI), and hyperthermia.</p>

            <p>Muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements of internal magnetic field shifts, known as the muon Knight shift, is used for determining pairing symmetries in superconductors. While this technique has been especially effective for $f$-electron-based heavy-fermion superconductors, it remains challenging in $d$-electron-based superconductors such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where the Knight shift is intrinsically small. Here, we report high-precision muon Knight shift measurements of superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We observe that using multiple pieces of crystals, a common practice in $\mu$SR measurements, induces a substantial paramagnetic shift below the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, when a weak magnetic field is applied. We attribute such an unresolved paramagnetic shift to stray fields generated by neighboring diamagnetic crystals. To avoid this, one piece of crystal was used in this study. We experimentally determine the muon Knight shift of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in the normal state to be -116$\pm$7 ppm. By combining the observed muon Knight shift with independently determined bulk magnetization data from the same crystal used in $\mu$SR and carefully separating various contributions to the shift, we confirm a significant reduction in the spin Knight shift below $T_c$, consistent with spin-singlet-like pairing. This result constitutes the precise muon Knight shift measurement in a $d$-electron-based superconductor. Our results highlight the potential of $\mu$SR as a powerful complementary technique to the established method of nuclear magnetic resonance for probing the spin susceptibility in superconductors.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the formation of Spin Faraday waves in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate under the stripe phase and explores the dispersion relation under three different phases. We discover that the SFW exhibit temporal and spatial patterns when the interaction is modulated periodically, and appear with resonant waves and higher order harmonics. SFW can be excited even when the modulation frequency resonates with the trap frequency. Furthermore, we study the dispersion relation of these Faraday modes through periodic modulation, which agrees well with our theoretical results under three quantum phases. Our work indicates novel physical phenomena originating from the introduction of spin-orbit coupling and provides a possible method for studying the dispersion of Bose gases.</p>

            <p>To optimize the processing conditions for the (Cr,Fe)S non-equilibrium phase with a pyrrhotite-type structure, the phase states and magnetic properties of the specimens obtained at various sintering temperatures were investigated. A slightly off-stoichiometric composition of Cr23Fe23S54 (approximately (Cr,Fe)7S8) sintered and quenched from 1323 K indicates a single-phase pyrrhotite-type structure with a layered-NiAs-type structure in which vacancies occupy every two layers (C12/c1; the space number is 15). The compound shows fully compensated ferrimagnetic behavior at a magnetization compensated temperature of approximately 200 K. The magnetic behavior exhibits a typical N-type ferrimagnet, as predicted by Néel. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, it is found that the compound is composed of Fe2+ and Cr3+. The large magnetic coercivity of 38 kOe at 5 K is also unique and can be applied to spintronic devices. Furthermore, changing the quenching temperature enables control of the degree of order of the vacancies in the interlayer and results in tuning of the magnetization compensated temperature. First-principles calculations show a pseudo-gap located at the Fermi level in the up-spin band, suggesting high spin polarization as well as the NiAs-type structure indicated in the previous our report.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the ruby lattice with uniform first- and second-neighbor interactions, which forms a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra. Using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS), we study the ground state of the system to find that it assumes a gapped threefold-degenerate simplex crystal ground state, with strong singlets formed on pairs of neighboring triangles. We argue that the formation of the simplex singlet ground state at the isotropic point relates to the weak inter-triangle coupling limit where an effective spin-chirality Hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice exhibits an extensively degenerate ground state manifold of singlet coverings at the mean-field level. Under an applied Zeeman field, the iPEPS simulations uncover magnetization plateaus at $m/m_s = 0, 1/3, 1/2,$ and $2/3$, separated by intermediate supersolid phases, all breaking the sixfold rotational symmetry of the lattice. Unlike the checkerboard lattice, these plateaus cannot be described by strongly localized magnons.</p>

            <p>Soft phonon modes in tetragonal CeCoSi, which undergoes a structural transition at $T_0=12$ K followed by antiferromagnetic order at $T_{\text{N}}=9.5$ K, have been investigated using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering. Pronounced softening was detected in the transverse acoustic modes corresponding to the $(yz+zx)$-type monoclinic distortion, consistent with the experimentally determined triclinic structure. Remarkably, the softening persists up to the zone boundary along (0, 0, $q$), indicating a short correlation length of the lattice instability. This instability, characterized by a Curie-type strain susceptibility, is interpreted as a consequence of the on-site $4f$-$5d$ hybridization, which is intrinsic to this crystal structure due to the lack of inversion symmetry at the two Ce sites.</p>

            <p>Dipolar quantum gases, encompassing atoms and molecules with significant dipole moments, exhibit unique long-range and anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions (DDI), distinguishing them from systems dominated by short-range contact interactions. This review explores their behavior across dimensions, focusing on magnetic atoms in quasi-2D in comparison to 3D. In 3D, strong DDI leads to phenomena like anisotropic superfluidity, quantum droplets stabilized by Lee-Huang-Yang corrections, and supersolid states with density modulations. In 2D, we discuss a new scenario where DDI induces angle-dependent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions and potential supersolidity, as suggested by recent experimental realizations of strongly dipolar systems in quasi-2D geometries. We identify key challenges for future experimental and theoretical work on strongly dipolar 2D systems. The review concludes by highlighting how these unique 2D dipolar systems could advance fundamental research as well as simulate novel physical phenomena.</p>

            <p>Dirac fermions, characterized by their linear dispersion and relativistic nature, have emerged as a prominent class of quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. While the Dirac equation, initially developed in the context of high-energy physics, provides a remarkable framework for describing the electronic properties of these materials, the inherent symmetry constraints of condensed matter often lead to deviations from the idealized paradigm. In particular, three-dimensional Dirac fermions in solids often exhibit anisotropic behavior, challenging the notion of perfect symmetry inherent in the Dirac equation. Here, we report the observation of isotropic massive Dirac fermions in LaAlSi through Landau level spectroscopy. The presence of three-dimensional massive Dirac fermions across the Fermi energy is demonstrated by quantized and semiclassical analyses of the magnetic field evolution of Landau level transitions. The isotropic topological nature, Fermi velocity, and Dirac mass are evidenced by the identical magneto-infrared response among the Faraday and three Voigt geometries. Furthermore, we observe an unusually large oscillator strength in the zeroth Landau level transition of the Dirac fermion, compared to transitions with higher indices. This phenomenon, supported by model calculations, can be attributed to the combined effects of the partial excitation of Dirac fermion and the resonant dielectric coupling with the Weyl plasma. Our work provides a strategy for realizing ideal quasiparticle excitations and their coupling effects in condensed matter systems, offering a platform for exploring relativistic physics.</p>

            <p>Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.</p>

            <p>The efficiency of water electrolysis in a photoelectrochemical cell is largely limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at its semiconductor photoanode. Reaction rate constants are key to investigating the slow kinetics of the multistep OER, as they indicate the rate-determining step. While these rate constants are usually calculated based on first-principles simulations, this research aims to estimate them from experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. Starting from a microkinetic model for charge transfer at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, an expression for the impedance as a function of the rate constants is derived. At lower potentials, the order of this impedance model is reduced, thus eliminating the rate constants corresponding to the last reaction steps. Moreover, it is shown that EIS data from at least two potentials needs to be combined in order to uniquely identify the rate constants of a particular reduced order model. Therefore, this work details a sample maximum likelihood estimator that integrates not only multiple frequencies, but also multiple potentials simultaneously. Measuring multiple periods of the current density and potential signals, allows this frequency domain estimator to take measurement uncertainty into account. In addition, due to the large numerical range of the rate constants, various scaling methods are implemented to achieve numerical stability. To find suitable initial values for the highly nonlinear optimization problem, different global estimation methods are compared. The complete estimation procedure of the rate constants is illustrated on simulated EIS data of a hematite photoanode.</p>

            <p>Analysis of the thermal and baric evolution of resistance in $LaBa_2Fe_3O_{8+\delta}$ enabled the construction of its pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram, which prominently displays a critical boundary, $P^{MIT}_c(T)$, marking the transition from localized to hole-type extended states. The relatively low critical pressures [$P^{MIT}_c(T) \approx 3$-8 GPa] suggest that, as $P \rightarrow P_c$ in this narrow-gap, strongly correlated charge-transfer system, both the hybridization strength and the charge-transfer character are progressively enhanced - ultimately leading to the emergence of metallicity. Emphasizing the electronic nature of this transition, pressure-dependent structural analyses at room temperature reveal no associated structural phase transition at $P^{MIT}_c(T)$; the system retains a (weakly tetragonally distorted) quasicubic perovskite structure with Murnaghan-type compressibility up to 30\,GPa. The emergence of hole delocalization and metallic conduction, coupled with suppressed antiferromagnetism, suggests proximity to quantum criticality.</p>

            <h2>Age-structured hydrodynamics of ensembles of anomalously diffusing particles with renewal resetting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baruch Meerson, Ohad Vilk</p>
            <p>We develop an age-structured hydrodynamic (HD) theory which describes the collective behavior of $N\gg 1$ anomalously diffusing particles under stochastic renewal resetting. The theory treats the age of a particle -- the time since its last reset -- as an explicit dynamical variable and allows for resetting rules which introduce global inter-particle correlations. The anomalous diffusion is modeled by the scaled Brownian motion (sBm): a Gaussian process with independent increments, characterized by a power-law time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D(t)\sim t^{2H-1}$, where $H>0$. We apply this theory to three different resetting protocols: independent resetting to the origin (model~A), resetting to the origin of the particle farthest from it (model~B), and a scaled-diffusion extension of the ``Brownian bees" model of Berestycki et al, Ann. Probab. \textbf{50}, 2133 (2022). In all these models non-equilibrium steady states are reached at long times, and we determine the steady-state densities. For model A the (normalized to unity) steady-state density coincides with the steady-state probability density of a single particle undergoing sBM with resetting to the origin. For model B, and for the scaled Brownian bees, the HD steady-state densities are markedly different: in particular, they have compact supports for all $H>0$. The age-structured HD formalism can be extended to other anomalous diffusion processes with renewal resetting protocols which introduce global inter-particle correlations.</p>

            <p>A density-based superfluid bound called Leggett's bound has been proved to be a good estimator of the superfluid fraction for cold atomic gases in the mean-field regime. Here, we investigate the accuracy of such bound in the strongly interacting regime, where the mean-field approach fails. Combining quantum Monte Carlo, Gross-Pitaevskii equation and field-theory calculations, we demonstrate that the bound serves as a reliable estimator of the superfluid fraction for strongly interacting bosons at 2D-1D dimensional crossover at low temperatures. By further presenting two counterexamples where the bound predicts trivial results, we shed light on the conditions under which the Leggett's bound serves as a good predictor.</p>

            <p>We analyze theoretically THz response of an electron-hole pair confined in a semiconductor nanoparticle. We show that the interplay of particle confinement and electron-hole Coulomb interaction leads to significant renormalizations and energy shifts in THz linear conductivity of the nanocrystal. We develop and evaluate models in the strong and the weak confinement regime in order to correctly address the effect of Coulomb interaction. In the weak confinement regime, we find solutions of the problem in a form similar to the Wannier wavefunction whose spatial extent is reduced as a consequence of the confinement. The resulting states are scalable down to the strong confinement regime, enabling a theoretical description of the exciton response for arbitrarily sized nanoparticles.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic liquid crystal models for lipid bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ingo Nitschke, Axel Voigt</p>
            <p>Coarse-grained continuous descriptions for lipid bilayers are typically based on minimizing the Helfrich energy. Such models consider the fluid properties of these structures only implicitly and have been shown to nicely reproduce equilibrium properties. Model extensions that also address the dynamics of these structures are surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models. They explicitly account for membrane viscosity. However, these models also usually treat the lipid bilayer as a homogeneous continuum, neglecting the molecular degrees of freedom of the lipids. Here, we derive refined models which consider in addition a scalar order parameter representing the molecular alignment of the lipids along the surface normal. Starting from hydrodynamic surface liquid crystal models, we obtain a hydrodynamic surface Landau--Helfrich model for asymmetric lipid bilayers and a surface Beris--Edwards model for symmetric lipid bilayers. The fully ordered case for both models leads to the known surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models. Besides more detailed continuous models for lipid bilayers, we therefore also provide an alternative derivation of surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models.</p>

            <p>We study anisotropic superconductivity in the nearly quarter-filled $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice. We analyze an extended Hubbard model with off-site attractive interactions within the mean-field framework and find two distinct chiral $d+id'$-wave superconducting phases characterized by different Chern numbers. We further investigate the superconducting mechanism mediated by spin fluctuations arising from purely repulsive interactions by applying the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation to the Hubbard model. The gap symmetry obtained by solving the linearized Eliashberg equation is $d$-wave, which corresponds to a $d+id'$-wave superconducting state with a Chern number of $8$, including the spin degree of freedom. The $\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{0}$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation, which possesses the largest spectral weight at finite energies arising from the incipient flat band, gives rise to an effective spin-singlet pairing glue between rim sites.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. J. Archer, D. N. Sibley, B. D. Goddard</p>
            <p>We develop a general method for determining the effective interaction potential between two or more droplets suspended within a fluid phase. Our approach is based on classical density functional theory. Here, we apply the method to determine the interaction potential between oil droplets suspended in water and also consider the influence of adding a third species, alcohol. This ternary mixture is that found in the ouzo beverage. The ouzo system exhibits spontaneous emulsification when the neat spirit is mixed with water. The oil emulsion that forms has been observed to be surprisingly long-lived. Here we show that the alcohol in the system does indeed play a role in making the droplets more stable, by decreasing the oil-water interfacial tension and therefore also the strength of the attractive interactions between droplets. Within our theory, the surfactant nature of the alcohol can be enhanced without changing the bulk fluid thermodynamics. In fact, our theory can be used to model surfactant mixtures. In this model, the effective interaction between pairs of oil droplets can become repulsive, with a free-energy barrier to droplets merging, thus making them stable.</p>

            <h2>Exceptional Excitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrico Perfetto, Gianluca Stefanucci</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian physics is reshaping our understanding of quantum systems by revealing states and phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. While non-Hermiticity is typically associated with gain-loss processes in open systems, we uncover a fundamentally different route to non-Hermitian behavior emerging from non-equilibrium correlations. In photoexcited semiconductors, the effective interaction between electrons and holes gives rise to a pseudo-Hermitian Bethe-Salpeter Hamiltonian (PH-BSH) that governs excitonic states in the presence of excited populations. Within this framework, we identify a previously unknown class of excitonic quasiparticles - exceptional excitons - corresponding to exceptional points embedded inside the electron-hole continuum. Exceptional excitons emerge at the onset of population inversion, and represent the strongly renormalized counterparts of the system's equilibrium excitons. They are spatially localized, protected against hybridization with the continuum, and remain long-lived even in regimes where conventional excitons undergo a Mott transition. Crucially, exceptional excitons appear only when the PH-BSH is evaluated with non-thermal, resonantly generated carrier populations that support an excitonic superfluid. Ab initio results for monolayer WS_2 explicitly demonstrate this scenario and show that exceptional excitons can be realized with existing ultrafast pumping techniques. We also identify distinctive optical and photoemission signatures that enable their unambiguous detection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marvin Leusch, Alessandro Toschi, Andreas Hausoel, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Georg Rohringer</p>
            <p>We analyze the impact of the lattice geometry on the thermodynamic transition to magnetically ordered phases in strongly interacting electron systems for various Bravais lattices in three and four dimensions, including both local and nonlocal correlation effects. In a first step we use the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which takes into account purely local correlations, to calculate the magnetic susceptibilities of the Hubbard model on three (3d-sc) and four dimensional (4d-sc) simple cubic/hypercubic, as well as on three dimensional body- (bcc) and face-centered (fcc) cubic lattices, and determine the transition temperature to the corresponding magnetically-ordered state. In a second step, we exploit the dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A), a diagrammatic extension of DMFT, to include the effect of nonlocal correlations which are particularly important in the vicinity of the corresponding phase transition. For the bipartite 3d-sc, 4d-sc and bcc lattices nonlocal fluctuations lead to a substantial reduction of the DMFT transition temperature consistent to the overall tendency of mean-field approaches to overestimate the stability of ordered phases. As expected, the magnitude of the difference between the DMFT, being exact in the limit of large connectivity/dimensions, and D$\Gamma$A transition temperatures decreases with increasing coordination number. On a more practical perspective, these results also provide a reasonable guidance to evaluate the expected overestimation of the DMFT ordering temperature for different material geometries. For the fcc lattice, on the other hand, the ordered phase observed in DMFT vanishes completely within D$\Gamma$A which is consistent with the existence of strong geometric frustration in this lattice.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid acousto-optical spin control in quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateusz Kuniej, Paweł Machnikowski, Michał Gawełczyk</p>
            <p>Mechanical degrees of freedom very weakly couple to spins in semiconductors. The inefficient coupling between phonons and single electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) hinders their integration into on-chip acoustically coupled quantum hybrid systems. We propose a hybrid acousto-optical spin control method that circumvents this problem and effectively introduces acoustic spin rotation to QDs, complementing their rich couplings with external fields and quantum registers. We show that combining continuous-wave detuned optical coupling to a trion state and acoustic modulation results in spin rotation around an axis defined by the acoustic field. The optical field breaks spin conservation, allowing phonons to drive transitions between disrupted spin states when at resonance with the Zeeman frequency. Our method is compatible with pulse sequences that mitigate quasi-static noise effects, which makes trion recombination the primary limitation to gate fidelity under cooled nuclear-spin conditions. Numerical simulations indicate that spin rotation fidelity can be very high, if the trion lifetime is long and Zeeman splitting is sufficiently large, with a currently feasible 50~ns lifetime and 44~GHz splitting giving 99.9\% fidelity. Applying our advancement could enable acoustic QD spin state transfer to diverse solid-state systems and transduction between acoustic, optical, and microwave domains, all within an on-chip integration-ready setting.</p>

            <p>We propose a single-layer tensor network framework for the variational determination of ground states in two-dimensional quantum lattice models. By combining the nested tensor network method [Phys. Rev. B 96, 045128 (2017)] with the automatic differentiation technique, our approach can reduce the computational cost by three orders of magnitude in bond dimension, and therefore enables highly efficient variational ground-state calculations. We demonstrate the capability of this framework through two quantum spin models: the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice and the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model. Even without GPU acceleration or symmetry implimention, we have achieved the bond dimension of 9 and obtained accurate ground-state energy and consistent order parameters compared to prior studies. In particular, we confirm the existence of an intermediate empty-plaquette valence bond solid ground state in the Shastry-Sutherland model. We have further discussed the convergence of the algorithm and its potential improvements. Our work provides a promising route for large-scale tensor network calculations of two-dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xavier Gonze, Christian Tantardini, Antoine Levitt</p>
            <p>The temperature dependence of most solid-state properties is dominated by lattice vibrations, but metals display notable purely electronic effects at low temperature, such as the linear specific heat and the linear entropy, that were derived by Sommerfeld for the non-interacting electron gas via the low-temperature expansion of Fermi-Dirac integrals. Here we treat temperature as a perturbation within density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). For finite temperature, we show how self-consistency screens the bare, temperature-induced density change obtained in the non-interacting picture: the inverse transpose of the electronic dielectric operator, that includes Adler-Wiser and a term related to the shift in Fermi level, links the self-consistent density response to the bare thermal density change. This approach is implemented in DFTK, and demonstrated by the computation of the second-order derivative of the free energy, and the first-order derivative of entropy for aluminum. Then, we examine the $T\!\to\!0$ limit. The finite temperature formalism contains divergences, that we cure using the Sommerfeld expansion to analyze metallic systems at 0 K. The electronic free energy is quadratic in $T$ provided the Fermi level is not at a Van Hove singularity of the density of states. If the latter happens, another temperature behavior might appear, depending on the type of Van Hove singularity, that we analyze. Our formulation applies to systems periodic in one, two, or three dimensions, and provides a basis for studying temperature-dependent electronic instabilities (e.g., charge-density waves) within density-functional theory and DFPT.</p>

            <h2>How Spatially Modulated Activity Reshapes Active Polymer Conformations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Malgaretti, Emanuele Locatelli</p>
            <p>Active polymers are driven out of equilibrium by internal forces and exhibit conformational properties that differ fundamentally from those of passive chains. Here we study how spatially modulated tangential activity reshapes the conformations of semiflexible polymers. Using a continuum Rouse model with bending rigidity, we develop a systematic expansion in the limit of weak activity and derive analytical expressions for mode correlations, gyration radius, and end-to-end distance under sinusoidally varying propulsion. We show that spatially structured activity breaks self-similar scaling and induces a mode-dependent transition between polymer shrinking and swelling. Uniform or low-mode forcing produces compact, globule-like conformations, whereas higher modes generate alternating stretched and compressed segments, leading to globally swollen chains. Different polymer sizes respond differently to activity, allowing for conformations that are compact in gyration radius yet extended in end-to-end distance. Langevin dynamics simulations quantitatively confirm the theoretical predictions. Our results demonstrate that even weak, patterned activity provides a powerful mechanism to control polymer conformations far from equilibrium.</p>

            <p>An electron beam may experience an anomalous spatial shift during an interface scattering process. Here, we investigate this phenomenon for reflection from mirror-symmetry-protected nodal-ring semimetals, which are characterized by an integer topological charge $\chi_h$. We show that the shift is generally enhanced by the presence of nodal rings, and the ring's geometry can be inferred from the profile of shift vectors in the interface momentum plane. Importantly, the anomalous shift encodes the topological information of the ring, where the circulation of the shift vector field $\kappa_s$ over a semicircle is governed by the topological charge, with a simple relationship: $\kappa_s=-2\pi \chi_h$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the shift and its circulation reflect distinct features of topological phase transitions of the charged rings. This study uncovers a novel physical signature of topological nodal rings and positions anomalous scattering shifts as a powerful tool for probing topological band structures.</p>

However, Yukhnovskii's technique, which yielded similar results, provided even deeper insight into the nature of this phenomenon. At that time, we, professor's students, saw only this aspect of his theory. Later, I realized that the mentioned Yukhnovskii's work naturally fits into a more general context of the turbulent development of quantum field theory and statistical physics in the last quarter of the twentieth century.

We characterize the device via numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating of both sides of the junction. While estimating noise contributions, we found novel expressions due to the temperatures of both sides being different than the bath temperature. Numerical simulations show a Noise Equivalent Power ${\rm NEP}\sim 4\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm W}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for an input power of $\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm W}$, a response time of $\tau_{th}\sim 200\, {\rm ns}$ and an integration time to obtain a Signal-to-Noise Ratio ${\rm SNR}=1$ of $\tau_{\rm SNR=1}\sim 100\,\mu{\rm s}$ for an input power $\sim 10^{-13}\,{\rm W}$.

            <p>We theoretically investigate spin-resolved thermoelectric transport in a triangular ladder geometry hosting antiferromagnetic spin alignment, where lattice topology and magnetic ordering jointly enable highly efficient spin-selective energy conversion. The inherent geometric frustration of the ladder, together with intrinsic spin-filtering mechanisms, is shown to promote a pronounced separation between spin channels. Implementing spin-dependent onsite modulations, such as binary asymmetric potentials, induces pronounced spin splitting in the transmission spectrum, enabling controlled spin-selective transport and highlighting the role of lattice engineering in tailoring spin-dependent thermoelectric response. Additional control is achieved through modulation of the hopping amplitudes, which activates multiple transport pathways and allows fine tuning of spin-dependent conduction. A detailed evaluation of charge and spin thermoelectric coefficients reveals a strong enhancement of the thermoelectric performance, with the dimensionless figure of merit ZT reaching large values in optimized parameter regimes. Notably, the spin figure of merit systematically surpasses its charge counterpart, underscoring the decisive role of lattice geometry and antiferromagnetic order in amplifying spin thermoelectric efficiency. Our findings provide a versatile theoretical platform for designing low-dimensional spin-caloritronic devices with enhanced functionality.</p>

            <p>An atomistic structural model for melt-quenched B$_2$O$_3$ glass has eluded the simulation community so far. The difficulty lies in the abundance of the six-membered boroxol rings - an intermediate-range order motif suggested through Raman and NMR spectroscopy - which is challenging to obtain in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we report the development of a DFT-accurate machine-learned potential for B$_2$O$_3$ and employ quench rates as low as 10$^{9}$ K/s to obtain B$_2$O$_3$ glasses with more than 30% of boron atoms in boroxol rings. Also, we show that the pressure, and consequently the boroxol fraction, in the deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations critically depends on the range of the geometry descriptor used in the embedding neural network, and at least a 9 $\unicode{x212B}$ range is required. The boroxol ring fraction increases with decreasing quench rate. Finally, amorphous B$_2$O$_3$ configurations display a minimum in energy at a boroxol fraction of 75%, intriguingly close to the experimental estimate in B$_2$O$_3$ glass.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongyi Zhang, Jun Zhan, Congcong Le, Hoi Chun Po, Jiangping Hu, Xianxin Wu</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in both bulk and thin-film bilayer nickelates has garnered significant attention. In this study, inspired by recent STM experiments on thin films, we investigate the quasiparticle interference (QPI) characteristics of bilayer nickelates in both normal and superconducting states to identify their Fermiology and pairing symmetry. We demonstrate that the mirror symmetry inherent in the bilayer structure induces mirror-selective quasiparticle scattering by establishing selection rules based on the mirror properties of impurities and the mirror eigenvalues of electronic wavefunctions. This mirror-selective scattering allows for the differentiation of distinct Fermiologies, as QPI patterns vary markedly between scenarios with and without the $d_{z^2}$-bonding Fermi surface (FS). Furthermore, it enables the separate detection of sign changes in superconducting gaps both within the same FS and between different FSs. Crucially, if the mirror-symmetry-enforced selection rules are ignored, the QPI response of an $s_\pm$-wave state can masquerade as that of a conventional $s$-wave state, leading to a misidentification of the pairing symmetry. When combined with field-dependent and reference QPI measurements, this approach facilitates the precise determination of pairing symmetry, even in the presence of FS-dependent gaps and gap anisotropy. Additionally, we discuss practical considerations for STM measurements to effectively identify the pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that mirror-selective QPI is a powerful tool for distinguishing between different Fermiologies and pairing states, which is helpful in pinning down pairing symmetry and revealing the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p>Streamlined prediction of the electronic properties of photoactive materials warrants a Density Functional Theory (DFT) based approach that (i) yields reliable bandgaps, (ii) is free of empirically tuned parameters, and (iii) exhibits low computational overhead. Here we show that for Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnGeS4 kesterite photovoltaic materials, all three of these demands are met by the DFT plus Hubbard U technique (DFT+U) with corrective parameters evaluated via minimum-tracking linear response. The predicted bandgaps are found to even marginally outperform those from the self-consistent GW approach. Key to this method's success is the application of Hubbard U corrections to all atomic subspaces that dominate the conduction and valence band edges, as opposed to the conventional approach of correcting 3d and 4f atomic states. Intriguingly, the inclusion of Hund's J corrections via the extended DFT+U+J functional significantly worsens these results. This under performance can be ameliorated through the use of the Burgess-Linscott-O'Regan (BLOR) flat-plane based Hubbard U plus Hund's J functional, with bandgap predictions in close agreement with the conventional DFT+U method. The DFT+U method is also used to predict defect-induced changes to the bandgap and associated formation energies, in 1,728-atom supercells.</p>

            <p>The crystal and magnetic structures of the nitride antiperovskite Mn$_3$GeN reveals ferrimagnetic order stemming from a distorted kagome-derived lattice of the Mn atoms. Polycrystalline Mn$_3$GeN was synthesized via a solid-state reaction and characterized using neutron powder diffraction, DC magnetometry, and first-principles calculations. Rietveld refinement reveals near-stoichiometric composition (Mn$_3$GeN$_{0.94(1)}$) adopting a tetragonal $I4/mcm$ structure at $T$ = 500 K and below, featuring axially distorted and tilted [NMn$_6$] octahedra that result in a buckled Mn kagome lattice. On heating, the tetragonal distortion and octahedral tilt angle decrease continuously before transitioning to the cubic $Pm\bar{3}m$ antiperovskite phase at $T \approx$ 524 K. Neutron diffraction and magnetometry together reveal noncollinear ferrimagnetic ordering. For 30 K $\le T \le$ 500 K, the magnetic structure is described by a single propagation vector, $k$ = (0, 0, 0), with inequivalent Mn1 and Mn2 sublattices that couple antiferromagnetically to yield a net moment. Density functional theory-based calculations show the different local moments originate from the bandwidths associated with the distinct Mn-N bond lengths. The temperature dependence of the sublattice moments indicates a compensation-like crossover between Mn1- and Mn2-derived magnetization near 380 K. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized subtlety in the magnetic and structural behavior of Mn$_3$GeN, highlighting the interplay between structural distortions, magnetic ordering, and electronic structure in kagome-derived antiperovskite materials.</p>

            <h2>Detection of Image Potential States above the vacuum level in GeTe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frédéric Chassot, Aki Pulkkinen, Ján Minár, Gunther Springholz, Matthias Hengsberger, Claude Monney</p>
            <p>The ferroelectric semiconductor {\alpha}-GeTe(111) has attracted significant attention in the last decade due to its unique properties, with extensive studies focusing on its occupied electronic bandstructure. In contrast, its unoccupied states - particularly those near the conduction band minimum - remain largely unexplored. In an effort to characterize those states, we surprisingly observe three image potential states (IPS) in {\alpha}-GeTe(111) extending up to 0.8 eV above the vacuum level. Using time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we resolve the full parabolic dispersions of the first three IPS and determine their binding energies. Our analysis, combined with Bloch spectral function calculations, reveals that the unexpected persistence of IPS above the vacuum level originates from strong dipole transitions and the presence of large electron reservoirs in GeTe.</p>

            <h2>Chemical Engineering of Altermagnetism in Two-Dimensional Metal-Organic Frameworks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego López-Alcalá, Alberto M. Ruiz, Andrei Shumilin, José J. Baldoví</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism represents a novel class of collinear antiferromagnetism exhibiting non-relativistic spin splitting without net magnetization, driven by lattice symmetry rather than spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we introduce a coordination-driven chemical strategy to realize altermagnetic (AM) spin splitting in two-dimensional (2D) planar tetracoordinated Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that replacing centrosymmetric pyrazine (pyz) ligands with non-centrosymmetric imidazole (imz) linkers in Cr-based MOFs reduces lattice symmetry, enabling g-wave AM spin splitting up to 65 meV. Furthermore, frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) allows selective ligand spin polarization, inducing a shift to d-wave AM anisotropy in polycyclic ligand-based 2D MOFs with spin splitting up to 83.9 meV. Microscopic magnetic exchange interactions (J) analysis reveals that ligand-mediated interactions dominate over metal-metal coupling, stabilizing AM order in systems with radical ligands. Interestingly, we further confirm AM spin splitting in spin wave spectrum, where chiral magnon splitting is observed. Finally, we show that AM spin splitting gives rise to experimentally accessible charge to spin conversion, emerging as a linear response in d-wave and as a symmetry-allowed nonlinear effect in g-wave 2D AM MOFs. This work establishes coordination chemistry as a powerful and versatile route to symmetry control in 2D MOFs, enabling rational design of 2D molecular materials with tunable electronic and AM properties for next-generation spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Size-strain characteristics of lead and gold under fast ramp compression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. F. Talantsev, D. A. Komkova</p>
            <p>Phase transitions in materials under fast ramp compression are an ongoing research topic, which is part of several global projects like inertial fusion. Currently, X-ray diffraction (XRD) examination of samples under fast ramp compression is limited to the determination of the sample phase state and the unit cell lattice parameters. Here, we propose to extend this examination route by introducing the Williamson-Hall analysis of the XRD data measured in samples under fast ramp rate conditions. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, we performed an analysis for ramp compressed lead $(P = 200 GPa)$ and gold $(P = 1003 GPa)$, which both exhibit a transition from the face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice to the body-centred cubic (bcc) lattice at the studied pressures. The analysis showed that lead under fast ramp compression has a nanocrystalline structure with a crystalline size of $D = (4 \pm 1) nm$ and lattice strain $\varepsilon = 0.006 \pm 0.002 $. The effect of extreme hardening of bcc-Pb under fast ramp compression can be explained as the formation of an ultrafine grain structure in this metal. Elemental gold exhibits average crystalline size $D > 12 nm $ and unprecedentedly high, for a pure metallic element, lattice strain $\varepsilon = 0.014 \pm 0.001 $ under fast ramp compression.</p>

            <h2>On the origin of the unusual strain morphologies and polar Moiré patterns in twisted ferroelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergey Prosandeev, Charles Paillard, Laurent Bellaiche</p>
            <p>Density functional theory calculations are conducted to understand and reveal the origin of the complex shear strain morphology and of the polar Moiré topological pattern recently observed in twisted BaTiO$_3$ bilayers. Our first-principles calculations, along with an original analysis of them allowing the decomposition of forces into the acoustic and optical contributions, point out to the occurrence of forces mostly acting on the {\it acoustic-related} motions to produce the standing waves of the shear strain. Such acoustic waves naturally generate a striking self-organization of the shear strains, and hence create a peculiar gradient of these shear strains. A Moiré dipole pattern, consisting of the interpenetrated arrays of vortices and antivortices made of the electric dipoles, then mostly arises due to the coupling of this gradient of the shear strain with the electric dipoles. Furthermore, other forces, namely acting on the motions associated with the {\it optical phonons}, could also play a role in the formation of these polar vortices and antivortices, but at a smaller extent.</p>

            <p>The thermal transport community is increasingly interested in rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) of their measurements. In this work, we argue that Bayesian parameter estimation (BPE) represents a powerful framework for both analysis/fitting and UQ. We provide a detailed walkthrough of the technique (including code to duplicate our results) and example analysis based on measuring the thermal conductance of a gold/sapphire interface with FDTR. Comparisons are made against traditional analysis/UQ techniques adopted by the thermal transport community. Notable advantages of BPE include the interpretability of its results, including the capacity to indicate incorrect input assumptions, as well as a way to balance overall goodness of fit against prior knowledge of feasible parameter values. In some cases, incorporating this additional information can affect not only the magnitude of error bars but the inferred values themselves.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory of thermomagnonic torques in insulating altermagnets and predict a spin-splitter magnonic torque arising from the spin Seebeck effect. Additionally, we predict an anisotropic entropic torque. We study the effects of these torques on magnetic-texture dynamics and identify various anisotropic responses to temperature gradients. In particular, we predict spin-current-induced domain-wall precession, which can slow domain-wall motion for certain temperature-gradient directions. We also predict a temperature-gradient-driven anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect that enables fast skyrmion motion in response to thermal gradients. Our findings will be useful for spintronic applications such as magnetic racetrack memories and will serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in insulating altermagnets with magnetic textures.</p>

Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.1763(5)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lindsay Bassman Oftelie, Michele Campisi</p>
            <p>The emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is beginning to reveal the intriguing role that information can play in quantum thermal engines. Information enters as a resource when considering feedback-controlled thermal machines. While both a general theory of quantum feedback control as well as specific examples of quantum feedback-controlled engines have been presented, still lacking is a general framework for such machines. Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox. We illustrate the application of our framework with a two-qubit engine. A remarkable observation is that more information does not necessarily result in better thermodynamic performance: sometimes knowing less is better.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Predictions of Process-Induced Deformation in Carbon/Epoxy Composites Using a Deep Operator Network</h2>

            <p>Fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix respond differently to manufacturing conditions due to mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion and matrix shrinkage during curing of thermosets. These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites.</p>

            <p>All-to-all interacting and disordered many-body systems are notoriously hard to simulate on quantum platforms, as interactions are commonly mediated by auxiliary degrees of freedom that lower the amount of disorder, introducing undesired correlations. In this work, we show how a Trotterization scheme can be effectively utilized to densify the disorder of the model. In particular, we study the statistical properties of the resulting model, as well as Trotterization errors in the simulation that affect the time evolution and dynamical observables. As a concrete example, we propose an implementation via a single-mode cavity QED platform of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We analyze several features of the effective model, such as the distribution of the effective couplings, the number of interacting sites, state preparation, and the behavior of quantum chaos probes. We conclude this work with a detailed investigation of the robustness of our findings against dissipation, both analytically and numerically.</p>

            <h2>Transversal Clifford-Hierarchy Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alison Warman, Sakura Schafer-Nameki</p>
            <p>We present a purely 2D transversal realization of phase gates at any level of the Clifford hierarchy, and beyond, using non-Abelian surface codes. Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i\pi/(4N)})$ in the logical $\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup.</p>

            <p>We extensively explore the connections between time-like entanglement and non-hermitian density matrices in quantum many-body systems. We classify setups where we encounter non-hermitian density matrices into two types: one is due to causal influences under unitary evolutions, and the other is due to non-unitary evolutions in non-hermitian systems. We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes. We explain how causal influences in a wormhole dual to a pair of non-hermitian quantum systems is possible even without interactions between them. We argue that to realize a traversable wormhole we need not only ordinary quantum entanglement but also time-like entanglement.</p>

            <p>Free probability provides a framework for describing correlations between non-commuting observables in complex quantum systems whose Hilbert-space states follow maximum-entropy distributions. We examine the robustness of this framework under a minimal deviation from freeness: the coupling of a single ancilla qubit to a Haar-distributed quantum circuit of dimension $D0 \gg 1$. We find that, even in this setting, the correlation functions predicted by free probability theory receive corrections of order $O(1)$. These modifications persist at long times, when the dynamics of the coupled system is already ergodic. We trace their origin to non-uniformly distributed stationary quantum states, which we characterize analytically and confirm numerically.</p>

Using a replica trick to average over measurement outcomes in the charge basis and tools from conformal field theory (CFT), we derive closed-form expressions for the cumulants of MIE. We show that exact Born-averaging over microscopic measurement outcomes becomes equivalent at low energy to averaging over conformal boundary conditions weighted by their corresponding partition functions. Our results yield distinctive critical behavior across all cumulants in the regime where the unmeasured parts of the system are maximally separated. We also obtain the full distribution of the post-measurement entanglement entropy, finding that it is generically bimodal and exhibits fat-tails. We corroborate our analytical predictions by numerical calculations and find good agreement between them.</p>

            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a powerful framework for studying non-perturbative phenomena in gauge theories. However, conventional approaches such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in imaginary time are limited, as they do not allow real time evolution and suffer from a sign problem in many important cases. Using Gauged Gaussian fermionic projected entangled pair states (GGFPEPS) as a variational ground state ansatz offers an alternative for studying LGTs through a sign-problem-free variational MC. As this method is extended to larger and more complex systems, understanding its numerical behavior becomes essential. While conventional action based MC has been extensively studied, the performance and characteristics of non-action-based MC within the GGFPEPS framework are far less explored. In this work, we investigate these algorithmic aspects, identifying an optimal update size for GGFPEPS-based MC simulations for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in $2+1$ dimensions. We show that gauge fixing generally slows convergence, and demonstrate that not exploiting the translation-invariance can, in some cases, improve the computational time scaling of error convergence. We expect that these improvements will allow advancing the simulation to larger and more complex systems.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the existence and effect of percolation in training deep Neural Networks (NNs) with dropout. Dropout methods are regularisation techniques for training NNs, first introduced by G. Hinton et al. (2012). These methods temporarily remove connections in the NN, randomly at each stage of training, and update the remaining subnetwork with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics. If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data. We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem. The theory shows the existence of a percolative effect in dropout. We also show that this percolative effect can cause a breakdown when training NNs without biases with dropout; and we argue heuristically that this breakdown extends to NNs with biases.</p>

            <p>Classical autoassociative memory models have been central to understanding emergent computations in recurrent neural circuits across diverse biological contexts. However, they typically neglect neuromodulatory agents that are known to strongly shape memory capacity and stability. Here we introduce a minimal, biophysically motivated associative memory network where neuropeptide-like signals are modeled by a self-adaptive, activity-dependent gating mechanism. Using many-body simulations and dynamical mean-field theory, we show that such gating fundamentally reorganizes the attractor structure: the network bypasses the classical spin-glass transition, maintaining robust, high-overlap retrieval far beyond the standard critical capacity, without shrinking basins of attraction. Mechanistically, the gate stabilizes transient ghost remnants of stored patterns even far above the Hopfield limit, converting them into multistable attractors. These results demonstrate that neuromodulation-like gating alone can dramatically enhance associative memory capacity, eliminate the sharp Hopfield-style catastrophic breakdown, and reshape the memory landscape, providing a simple, general route to richer memory dynamics and computational capabilities in neuromodulated circuits and neuromorphic architectures.</p>

            <p>Out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems exhibit rapid correlation buildup that underlies many emerging phenomena. Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Encounter Times of Intermittently Running Particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lizzy Teryoshin, Mario Hidalgo-Soria, Elena F. Koslover</p>
            <p>Intracellular processes often rely on the timely encounter of mobile reaction partners, including intermittently motor-driven organelles. The underlying cytoskeletal network presents a complex landscape that both directs particle movement and introduces quenched disorder through filament organization. We investigate the mean first encounter times for pairs of intermittently processive and diffusive particles, moving in two dimensions with and without a fixed filament network. In unstructured domains, increasing particle run-length enhances exploration of the domain, but tends to slow down the encounter times compared to equivalent diffusing particles. Encounters for long-running particles occur preferentially near the periphery, contrasting with bulk encounters for the purely diffusive case. When particles are unbiased in their runs along dense filament networks, encounters are shown to be well approximated by a continuum run-and-tumble model. For biased particles, regions of convergent filament orientation can serve as traps that slow the overall spatial exploration but can allow for faster encounter rates by funneling particles into regions of reduced dimensionality. These findings provide a framework for estimating intracellular encounter kinetics, highlighting the role of key physical features such as the effective diffusivity, run times, and network architecture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. S. Liu, X. Z. Zhang</p>
            <p>Unraveling the mechanisms of ergodicity breaking in complex quantum systems is a central pursuit in nonequilibrium physics. In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional spin model featuring a tunable long-range hopping term, $H_{n}$, which introduces nonlocal interactions and bridges the gap between Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Through a systematic analysis of level-spacing statistics, Krylov complexity, and entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that $H_{n}$ acts as a universal control parameter driving the transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Specifically, increasing the strength of $H_{n}$ induces a crossover from Poissonian to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble statistics in the Hermitian limit, and similarly triggers chaotic dynamics in the non-Hermitian case. Most remarkably, despite the onset of global chaos, we identify a tower of exact nonthermal eigenstates that evade thermalization. These states survive as robust quantum many-body scars, retaining low entanglement and coherent dynamics even under strong non-Hermitian perturbations. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which long-range and non-Hermitian effects reshape quantum ergodicity, offering new pathways for preserving quantum coherence in complex many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Discrete time crystals enabled by Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling-Zhi Tang, Xiao Li, Z. D. Wang, Dan-Wei Zhang</p>
            <p>Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases of matter that break the discrete time-translation symmetry and is characterized by a robust subharmonic response in periodically driven quantum systems. Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $\pi$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Analogue gravity explores how collective excitations in condensed matter systems can reproduce the behavior of fields in curved spacetimes. An important example is the acoustic black holes that can occur for sound in a moving fluid. In these lecture notes, we focus on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), quantum fluids that provide an interesting platform for analogue gravity studies thanks to their accurate theoretical description, remarkable experimental control, and ultralow temperatures that allow the quantum nature of sound to emerge. We give a pedagogical introduction to analogue black holes and the theoretical description of BECs and their elementary excitations, which behave as quantum fields in curved spacetimes. We then apply these tools to survey the current understanding of black-hole superradiance and analogue Hawking radiation, including explicit examples and numerical methods.</p>

            <h2>Not all Chess960 positions are equally complex</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Barthelemy</p>
            <p>We analyze strategic complexity across all 960 Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) starting positions. Stockfish evaluations show a near-universal first-move advantage for White ($\langle E \rangle = +0.30 \pm 0.14$ pawns), indicating that the advantage conferred by moving first is a robust structural feature of the game. To quantify decision difficulty, we introduce an information-based measure $S(n)$ describing the cumulative information required to identify optimal moves over the first $n$ plies. This measure decomposes into contributions from White and Black, $S_W$ and $S_B$, yielding a total opening complexity $S_{\mathrm{tot}} = S_W + S_B$ and a decision asymmetry $A=S_B-S_W$. Across the ensemble, $S_{\mathrm{tot}}$ varies by a factor of three, while $A$ spans from $-2.5$ to $+1.8$ bits, showing that some openings burden White and others Black. The mean $\langle A \rangle = -0.25$ bits indicates a slight tendency for White to face harder opening decisions. Standard chess (position \#518, \texttt{RNBQKBNR}) exhibits above-average asymmetry (91st percentile) but typical overall complexity (47th percentile). The most complex opening is \#226 (\texttt{BNRQKBNR}), whereas \#198 (\texttt{QNBRKBNR})is the most balanced, with both evaluation and asymmetry near zero. These results reveal a highly heterogeneous Chess960 landscape in which small rearrangements of the back-rank pieces can significantly alter strategic depth and competitive fairness. Remarkably, the classical starting position-despite centuries of cultural selection-lies far from the most balanced configuration.</p>

            <h2>Sensor free, self regulating thermal switching via anomalous Ettingshausen effect and spin reorientation in DyCo5</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shibo Wang, Hiroki Tsuchiura, Nobuaki Terakado</p>
            <p>We propose a sensor free, self regulating thermal switch that combines the anomalous Ettingshausen effect (AEE) with a temperature driven spin reorientation transition (SRT) in the rare earth cobalt compound DyCo$_5$. Using density functional theory and the Kubo linear-response formalism, we compute the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}(\varepsilon)$ and the finite temperature anomalous Nernst conductivity $\alpha_{xy}(T)$ for two magnetization directions, magnetization parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. While the intrinsic $\sigma_{xy}$ at the Fermi level remains sizable for both orientations, $\alpha_{xy}$ exhibits an about two orders of magnitude contrast in the SRT temperature window. This contrast is consistent with the low temperature Mott relation through the energy slope $\partial_\varepsilon \sigma_{xy}(\varepsilon)\rvert_{E_{\mathrm F}}$ and is traced to strongly peaked Berry curvature hot spots generated by spin orbit coupling induced avoided crossings of Co $3d$ bands. Combining $\alpha_{xy}$ with longitudinal transport coefficients, we estimate device level metrics, namely the anomalous Nernst thermopower $S_{\mathrm{ANE}}$ and the Ettingshausen coefficient $\Pi_{\mathrm{AEE}}=T S_{\mathrm{ANE}}$, and demonstrate robust orientation controlled switching under a fixed in plane bias current. These results establish a materials based route to compact thermal control without external sensors or feedback electronics and provide a concrete example that the proposed principle can be realized in an existing ferromagnet.</p>

When ambient chemostats feed a chemomechanical feedback loop involving a nonlinear reaction network, surface stresses caused by the Marangoni effect and the ensuing hydrodynamic motion, drops show a variety of increasingly complex biomimetic motility modes including shuttling, bipedal, rotational, intermittently chaotic and chaotic motion. We determine the corresponding nonequilibrium phase diagram and show that the complexity of the motion arises from competing length scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Helene Wetter, Jan Wingenbach, Falk Rehberg, Wenlong Gao, Stefan Schumacher, Thomas Zentgraf</p>
            <p>Metasurfaces are a powerful tool for manipulating light using small structures on the nanoscale. In most meta-surfaces, near-field couplings are treated as unfavorable perturbations. Here, we experimentally investigate a structure consisting of sinusoidally modulated silicon waveguides where near-field coupling of local resonances leads to negative coupling, i.e. a negative coupling constant. This gives rise to wave-vector dependent eigenstates of elliptical, linear and circular polarizations. In particular, fully circular polarization states are not only present at a single point in momentum-space (k-space), but along a line. This circular polarization line, as well as a linear polarization line, emanates from a polarization degeneracy at the Dirac point. We experimentally validate the existence of these eigenstates and demonstrate the energy-, polarization- and wave-vector-dependence of this metasurface. By tuning the incident k-vector, certain polarization-energy eigenstates are strongly reflected allowing for uses in angle-tunable polarization filters and light sources.</p>

            <p>Reliable charging protocols are crucial for advancing quantum batteries toward practical use. We investigate a transverse-field Ising chain as a quantum battery, focusing on the combined role of qubit interactions in the battery model and finite charging time. This interplay yields smoother and more controllable charging compared to sudden protocols or non-interacting batteries. Introducing stochastic noise reveals a strong dependence on the charging trajectory. Protocols that weakly excite the system gain energy under noise but lose extractable work. In contrast, protocols that strongly excite many modes show the opposite trend: noise reduces stored energy yet improves efficiency, defined as the ratio of ergotropy to stored energy. These findings demonstrate that finite-time ramps stabilize charging and highlight that noise can either hinder or enhance quantum-battery performance depending on the protocol.</p>

            <h2>Reading Qubits with Sequential Weak Measurements: Limits of Information Extraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesar Lema, Aleix Bou-Comas, Atithi Acharya, Vadim Oganesyan, Anirvan Sengupta</p>
            <p>Quantum information processing and computation requires high accuracy qubit configuration readout. In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them. Our results should be useful both for quantum device operation and optimization and also, possibly, for improving the performance of recent machine learning approaches for qubit and multiqubit configuration readout in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) experiment regimes.</p>

            <p>We present a general method for engineering qudits through individually addressable transitions between Zeeman sublevels, achieved by combining a large linear Zeeman shift with a state-dependent light shift. This approach lifts the degeneracy between adjacent states while simultaneously tuning their energy splittings into the radio-frequency (RF) domain, enabling coherent manipulation within the Zeeman manifold using experimentally accessible drive frequencies. As a concrete realization, we investigate the implementation of an $SU(5)$ \emph{quintet} encoded in the Zeeman sublevels of the long-lived $^3\mathrm{P}_2$ state of neutral $\mathrm{^{88}Sr}$ atoms confined in far-detuned, $\sigma^{-}$-polarized optical tweezers. Using realistic experimental parameters, we numerically demonstrate full control of the \emph{quintet} manifold, including initialization into a specific $SU(5)$ basis state via a multi-photon transfer, coherent state- and site-selective single-qudit rotations driven by RF fields, and fast state-selective optical readout. Our simulations predict state-preparation fidelities of $\mathcal{F} \simeq 0.99$ within $\sim 1~\mu \rm{s}$, single-qudit gate fidelities of $\mathcal{F} \simeq 0.99$ with $\pi$-pulse durations of $\sim 2.5~\mu \rm{s}$, and fast destructive imaging with durations below $10~\mu \rm{s}$. These results establish a broadly applicable framework for high-fidelity control of Zeeman sublevel-encoded qudits and highlight the $^3\mathrm{P}_2$ manifold in strontium as a promising platform for scalable qudit-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Iontronics is a burgeoning paradigm that employs ions in solution as information carriers for sensing and computing, e.g., in neuromorphic devices. The fundamentally different working principle as compared to electronics requires novel approaches and concepts to control the impedance of nanoscale fluidic circuit elements, such as nanopores. For instance, previous research has focused on voltage-induced pore wetting as a means to trigger conduction in nanopores. The present study explores the opposite counter-intuitive mechanism: using voltage to dry hydrophobic nanopores and, therefore, to turn off conduction. This "electrodrying" concept affords exquisite, bidirectional control over the conductance of nanopores additionally showing hysteresis in the current-voltage curve that is the fingerprint of memristors. Using an analytical model and free-energy molecular dynamics simulations, we explain the physical mechanism underlying electrodrying and provide clear design criteria for solid-state and biological nanopores with bidirectional control over conductance. The electrical behaviour of electrodrying nanopores shows two unique features: i) the hysteresis loop is shifted from the origin, accounting for the fifth, previously unreported memristor type and ii) negative differential resistance is observed over a broad voltage range in which the non-conductive state is favoured by electrodrying. These properties are demonstrated in a short-term memory task and in an iontronic oscillator circuit to showcase their potential in neuromorphic applications and iontronic devices. Finally, we validate our predictions through experiments on engineered dipolar hydrophobic CytK nanopores, whose voltage-dependent conductance substantiates the electrodrying concept.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments show that the ground state of some layered materials with localized moments is in close proximity to the Kitaev spin liquid, calling for a proper model to describe the measurements. The Kitaev-Hubbard (KHu) model is the minimal model that captures the essential ingredients of these systems; it yields the Kitaev-Heisenberg spin model at the strong coupling limit and contains the charge fluctuations present in these materials as well. Despite its relevance, the phase diagram of the KHu model has not been rigorously revealed yet. In this work, we study the full phase diagram of the KHu model using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin mean-field theory as well as the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo on rather large systems and at low temperatures. The Mott transition is signaled by a vanishing quasiparticle weight evaluated using the slave-spin construction. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are multiple magnetic phase transitions within the Mott phase including magnetically ordered phases and most notably a quantum spin liquid phase for $1.0 \lesssim t^{\prime}/t \lesssim 1.11 $ at $U/t=5$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Airat Kamaletdinov, Natalia G. Berloff</p>
            <p>We introduce DOMINO, a light-matter computing platform that exploits the full complex amplitude of coupled condensate networks to solve maximum-weight clique problems and reveal hidden indirect correlations in large graphs. By embedding network structure directly into a gain-controlled polaritonic (or photonic) oscillator array, DOMINO performs analog optimization, directly solving the maximum-weight clique problem via the gain-controlled minimisation, through a physically enforced global-intensity constraint, allowing the system to converge rapidly to dominant subnetworks while simultaneously extracting phase, encoded co- and counter-regulation patterns. This gain-based mechanism unlocks capabilities inaccessible to conventional Ising-type simulators: all degrees of freedom (amplitude and phase) participate in the computation, dramatically expanding the class of problems that can be efficiently encoded. Our approach is inherently ultrafast, energy-efficient, and naturally robust to noise, requiring no digital post-processing. Applied to real gene-gene coexpression data, DOMINO reliably identifies biologically meaningful transcription-regulator modules and exposes latent regulatory relationships. Because the method applies generically to any weighted network, it establishes a scalable physical route to solving high-value graph-analytic tasks across biology, finance, social systems, and engineered networks.</p>

            <p>The energy landscape picture is a central tool to study many-body systems. In particular, the energy landscapes of glass-forming liquids, jammed packings, constraint satisfaction problems, or neural networks contain a plethora of minima corresponding to competing states. Due to their complexity, these landscapes resist analytical treatment and must be studied numerically. We focus on jammed soft spheres, a paradigmatic model of glasses and granulars, to expose the limitations of standard numerical methods in resolving the true structure of energy landscapes. We show that CVODE is the ODE solver with the best time-for-error trade-off, outperforming commonly used steepest-descent solvers by several orders of magnitude. Using this numerical approach, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderately low dimensions. Employing a range of geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that earlier claims on the fractality of basins of attraction of minima originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies. In reality, the basins of attraction of soft sphere packings are smooth structures with well-defined length scales, a result that likely extends to a much broader family of problems.</p>

            <p>The pairing mechanism in doped antiferromagnets is essential for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the pairing mechanism in bosonic doped antiferromagnets via large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations of the bosonic $t$-$J$ model. We discover a pair density wave (PDW) coexists with the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping. The pairing is attributed to a hidden many-body Berry phase that introduces the sole ``sign problem'' into this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration to the spin-charge interference pattern. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as the Berry phase is trivialized in the ferromagnetic condensate at larger doping or switched off into the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$. The present pairing mechanism -- distinct from the conventional mechanisms based on Fermi surface instabilities -- may provide a different perspective and new insights for understanding the complex nature of doped Mott insulators and is promising to be probed on qudit-based quantum simulators such as ultracold Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>We introduce an active-space embedding framework for core-level spectroscopies that connects localized atomic multiplets to continuum resonances within a plane-wave DFT/PAW description. The approach is complementary to widely used core-level Bethe--Salpeter implementations based on a two-particle (core-exciton) picture with typically static screening: here a correlated multiplet manifold of the absorber (including the core hole and open-shell configurations) is coherently coupled to a plane-wave photoelectron, enabling a unified treatment of localized multiplet structure and continuum lineshapes. Spectra are computed in a general time-domain formulation equivalent to Fermi's golden rule: a transition operator tailored to the specific spectroscopy technique is applied to the correlated ground state to generate an excited wavepacket, and the corresponding wavepacket autocorrelation function is evaluated without explicit real-time propagation, using Lanczos tridiagonalization or the kernel polynomial method; the spectral intensity follows from its Fourier representation. We validate the method at the Ce \(N_{4,5}\) edges, reproducing in quantitative agreement with experiment both high-\(Q\) multiplet features and the low-\(Q\) giant dipole resonance continuum, including a characteristic low-energy shoulder relevant for robust Ce valence assignments. The implementation is available open-source within the Quantum ESPRESSO XSPECTRA package (xspectruplet mode), together with reproducible inputs and scripts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritwik Das, Arkamitra Sen, Indra Dasgupta</p>
            <p>The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the symmetry allowed nearest-neighbor intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the nearest-neighbor intrinsic SOC incorporated in a minimal tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$, where SOC terms emerge due to the electric field produced by the surrounding atoms not lying in the kagome plane. Further, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi$=constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed minimal tight-binding model.</p>

            <p>The functional renormalization group (FRG) approach for spin models relying on a pseudo-fermionic description has proven to be a powerful technique in simulating ground state properties of strongly frustrated magnetic lattices. A drawback of the FRG framework is that it is formulated in the imaginary-time Matsubara formalism and thus only able to access static correlations, a limitation shared with most other many-body approaches. A description of the dynamical properties of magnetic systems is the key to bridging the gap between theory and neutron scattering spectra. We take the decisive step of expanding the scope of pseudo-fermion FRG to the Keldysh formalism, which, while originally developed to address non-equilibrium phenomena, enables a direct calculation of the equilibrium dynamical spin structure factors on generic lattices in arbitrary dimension. We identify the principal features characterizing the low-energy spectra of exemplary zero-, one- and two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg models as well as the Kitaev honeycomb model while identifying current limitations of the method that have to be improved upon.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism is a collinear magnetic order in which opposite spin species are exchanged under a real-space rotation. Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group symmetry. This form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the stochastic dynamics of point defects in a two-dimensional hexagonal colloidal crystal. Using a stochastic dynamical framework (evolution mechanics), we first extract the position-dependent drift vector and diffusion matrix from experimental trajectories, revealing dynamics that go beyond simple diffusion with constant coefficients. We then reconstruct a stochastic potential landscape by applying a periodic constraint and an equilibrium approximation within this framework. The energy differences between local minima in this landscape agree in order of magnitude with prior experimental estimates. Furthermore, analysis of the fit residuals under the equilibrium approximation provides evidence of nonequilibrium dynamics in di-vacancies. This work demonstrates how time-series analysis combined with this theoretical framework can uncover effective energy landscapes and assess detailed-balance violation in defect motion, providing a general approach for studying complex dynamics in confined systems.</p>

Laser-induced perturbation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results in a change of the intersublattice canting within first picoseconds, bringing Fe$_3$BO$_6$ to a hidden phase. Once this phase emerges, laser-induced heating activates precessional 90$^\circ$ spin switching. Combination of the spin canting and heating controls the final spin configuration comprising coexisting initial and switched phases. Extended phase coexistence range is in a striking contrast to the narrow SR transition in Fe$_3$BO$_6$ induced by conventional heating.</p>

            <h2>Fast Interlayer Energy Transfer from the Lower Bandgap MoS2 to the Higher Bandgap WS2</h2>

            <p>Energy transfer (ET) is a dipole-dipole interaction, mediated by the virtual photon. Traditionally, ET happens from the higher (donor) to lower bandgap (acceptor) material. However, in some rare instances, ET can happen from the lower-to-higher bandgap material, depending on the strong overlap between the acceptor photoluminescence (PL) and the donor absorption spectra. In this work, we report an ET process from the lower bandgap MoS2 to the higher bandgap WS2, due to a near 'resonant' overlap between the MoS2 B and WS2 A excitonic levels. Changing the MoS2 bandgap from direct-to-indirect by increasing the layer number results in a reduced ET rate, evidenced by the quenching of the WS2 PL emission. Our work shows at 300 K, the ET timescale of ~33 fs is faster than the reported thermalization of the MoS2 excitonic intervalley scattering (K to K') time and competing with the ultrafast charge transfer timescale. Thus, allowing us to open a new direction in understanding the competing inter/intralayer processes.</p>

            <p>Understanding the anharmonic phonon properties of crystal compounds -- such as phonon lifetimes and thermal conductivities -- is essential for investigating and optimizing their thermal transport behaviors. These properties also impact optical, electronic, and magnetic characteristics through interactions between phonons and other quasiparticles and fields. In this study, we develop an automated first-principles workflow to calculate anharmonic phonon properties and build a comprehensive database encompassing more than 6,000 inorganic compounds. Utilizing this dataset, we train a graph neural network model to predict thermal conductivity values and spectra from structural parameters, demonstrating a scaling law in which prediction accuracy improves with increasing training data size. High-throughput screening with the model enables the identification of materials exhibiting extreme thermal conductivities -- both high and low. The resulting database offers valuable insights into the anharmonic behavior of phonons, thereby accelerating the design and development of advanced functional materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme Fiusa, Pedro E. Harunari, Abhaya S. Hegde, Gabriel T. Landi</p>
            <p>Understanding fluctuations of observables across stochastic trajectories is essential for various fields of research, from quantum thermal machines to biological motors. We introduce a framework to analyze the statistics of counting observables in sub-trajectories$-$dubbed as stochastic excursions$-$of processes out of equilibrium. Given a partition of the state space into two sets $A$ and $B$, an excursion is defined as the segment of the trajectory that starts with a transition from $A$ to $B$ and ends upon the first return from $B$ to $A$. Our approach offers analytical expressions for the full distribution of counting observables (such as currents, heat, work, entropy production, and dynamical activity) and the excursion duration, capturing their correlations and finite-time fluctuations. As our main result, we uncover a nontrivial fundamental relation between fluctuations of counting observables at the single-excursion level and the steady state noise obtained from full counting statistics, offering a tool to inspect noise sources. We also show the existence of a fluctuation theorem and a thermodynamic uncertainty relation at the level of individual excursions. We discuss examples from distinct fields in which the excursion framework naturally addresses relevant questions, and explore in more detail how analyzing excursions yields additional insights into the operation of the three-qubit absorption refrigerator.</p>

            <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to materials science questions, including literature comprehension, property prediction, materials discovery and alloy design. At the same time, a wide range of physics-based computational approaches have been developed in which materials properties can be calculated. Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA) benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better. MatTools provides a standardized framework for assessing and improving LLM capabilities for materials science tool applications, facilitating the development of more effective AI systems for materials science and general scientific research.</p>

            <h2>Accelerating the Search for Superconductors Using Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suhas Adiga, Umesh V. Waghmare</p>
            <p>Prediction of critical temperature $(T_c)$ of a superconductor remains a significant challenge in condensed matter physics. While the BCS theory explains superconductivity in conventional superconductors, there is no framework to predict $T_c$ of unconventional, higher $T_{c}$ superconductors. Quantum Structure Diagrams (QSD) were successful in establishing structure-property relationship for superconductors, quasicrystals, and ferroelectric materials starting from chemical composition. Building on the QSD ideas, we demonstrate that the principal component analysis of superconductivity data uncovers the clustering of various classes of superconductors. We use machine learning analysis and cleaned databases of superconductors to develop predictive models of $T_c$ of a superconductor using its chemical composition. Earlier studies relied on datasets with inconsistencies, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this, we introduce a data-cleaning workflow to enhance the statistical quality of superconducting databases by eliminating redundancies and resolving inconsistencies. With this improvised database, we apply a supervised machine learning framework and develop a Random Forest model to predict superconductivity and $T_c$ as a function of descriptors motivated from Quantum Structure Diagrams. We demonstrate that this model generalizes effectively in reasonably accurate prediction of $T_{c}$ of compounds outside the database. We further employ our model to systematically screen materials across materials databases as well as various chemically plausible combinations of elements and predict $\mathrm{Tl}_{5}\mathrm{Ba}_{6}\mathrm{Ca}_{6}\mathrm{Cu}_{9}\mathrm{O}_{29}$ to exhibit superconductivity with a $T_{c}$ $\sim$ 105 K. Being based on the descriptors used in QSD's, our model bypasses structural information and predicts $T_{c}$ merely from the chemical composition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme Fiusa, Pedro E. Harunari, Abhaya S. Hegde, Gabriel T. Landi</p>
            <p>Many natural systems exhibit dynamics characterized by alternating phases or recurring sets of states. Describing the fluctuations of such systems over stochastic trajectories is necessary across diverse fields, from biological motors to quantum thermal machines. In an accompanying Letter, we introduced the notion of stochastic excursions$-$a framework to analyze out of equilibrium processes via sub-trajectories. Through counting observables, this framework captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, which provides insights into thermodynamical trade-offs between thermodynamic quantities of interest, such as entropy production and dynamical activity. In this work, we enhance this formalism by providing a suite of technical results on how to efficiently compute excursion-related quantities. Our analytical results provide explicit formulas for general moments of counting variables and excursion duration, as well as their covariance and conditional moments. We show that excursion statistics recover full counting statistics results, and uncover a relation between fluctuations of counting observables at single-excursion level and the steady state diffusion coefficient (noise). We also discuss a fluctuation theorem for individual excursions and show that it implies a modified thermodynamic uncertainty relation at the excursion level. In addition, we explore how analyzing excursions and using the results developed here can yield insights into three problems of interest: the three-qubit absorption refrigerator, cellular sensing, and birth-and-death processes.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Viscous Hydrodynamics From a Single Quantum Particle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Li Zhou, Mauricio Hippert, Nicki Mullins, Jorge Noronha</p>
            <p>We investigate an explicit example of how spatial decoherence can lead to hydrodynamic behavior in the late-time, long-wavelength regime of open quantum systems. We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in open quantum systems where a system with few degrees of freedom is coupled to a large thermal environment.</p>

            <p>We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</p>

            <h2>Flocking with random non-reciprocal interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiwon Choi, Jae Dong Noh, Heiko Rieger</p>
            <p>Flocking is ubiquitous in nature and emerges due to short- or long-range alignment interactions among self-propelled agents. Two unfriendly species that antialign or even interact nonreciprocally show more complex collective phenomena, ranging from parallel and antiparallel flocking over run-and-chase behavior to chiral phases. Whether flocking or any of these collective phenomena can survive in the presence of a large number of species with random nonreciprocal interactions remained elusive so far. As a first step here, the extreme case of a Vicsek-like model with fully random nonreciprocal interactions between the individual particles is considered. For infinite-range interaction, as soon as the alignment bias is of the same order as the random interactions, the ordered flocking phase occurs, but deep within this phase, the random nonreciprocal interactions can still support global chiral and oscillating states in which the collective movement direction rotates or oscillates slowly. For short-range interactions, moreover, even without alignment bias self-organized cliques emerge, in which medium-size clusters of particles that have predominantly aligning interactions meet accidentally and stay together for macroscopic times. These results may serve as a starting point for the study of multispecies flocking models with nonrandom but complex nonreciprocal interspecies interactions.</p>

            <p>Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of summary statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.</p>

            <p>Multi-donor architecture in silicon offers a promising direction towards scalable solid-state qubits and quantum technologies operating at practical conditions. However, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions develops a complex internal electronic configuration with several discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete-correlated states is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards their practical implementations in quantum-technologies. We have experimentally demonstrated quantum Coulomb blockade mediated systematic filling of several electrons into orbital-resolved molecular states within multi-phosphorous-donor molecules accompanied by a correlated decrement in charging energies for higher hybridized orbitals due to expanded Bohr radii and electron delocalization. Corresponding, first-principle density functional theory calculations offer microscopic insight into the orbital configurations, while the rate equation simulations of quantum Coulomb blockade faithfully reproduce the experimental stability diagrams. This comprehensive characterization advances and discusses the role of donor-molecules in silicon in scalable building blocks for quantum technologies operable at elevated temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Fermion quantum criticality far from equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohan Mittal, Tom Zander, Johannes Lang, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.</p>

            <p>Conventional wisdom holds that, in the simplest time-reversal-symmetric setting, strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb Z_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are rendered with negligible gain while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes -- without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Blumenfeld</p>
            <p>Recent observations of coordinated self-organisation (SO) of stress and structure in granular systems provide insight into the fundamental principle underlying this phenomenon. It is first argued here that SO emerges when a minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p>We propose a four-stroke quantum thermal machine based on the 1D anyon Hubbard model, which is capable of extracting the excess energy arising from anyon exclusion statistics at low temperature into finite work. Defining a hybrid anyon-Otto (HAO) cycle, we find that the low-temperature work, in the absence of any interactions, is maximized in the pseudo-fermionic limit, where the anyons most closely resemble free fermions. However, when weak interactions are introduced, the work output is no longer maximized at the bosonic or pseudo-fermionic extremes but instead peaks at intermediate statistical angles. This clearly demonstrates that interactions and anyonic statistics conspire non-trivially to enhance performance, with interacting anyons offering greater quantum thermodynamic advantage than either bosons or pseudo-fermions, in this regime. Furthermore, we also outline an experimental protocol to realize the HAO cycle using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice.</p>

We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wentao Yang, Zhaoru Sun</p>
            <p>Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.</p>

            <p>Harnessing the quantum coherence and tunability of molecular-scale structures, we theoretically explore thermoelectric transport in ring-shaped molecular junctions featuring dimerized hopping integrals. By engineering alternating strong and weak bonds in both staggered and non-staggered configurations, we reveal a marked transmission asymmetry that drives a substantial enhancement in the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT. To further steer transport behavior, we introduce controlled aperiodicity via site-energy modulations in unit cell format governed by the Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) potential, a quasiperiodic landscape that enables tunable localization-delocalization transitions. This interplay between hopping dimerization and AAH-type disorder gives rise to energy filtering effects and a rich spectrum where extended and critical states coexist, amplifying the Seebeck coefficient while preserving finite electrical conductance. Through a comprehensive non-equilibrium Green's function analysis, we uncover how key device parameters, including disorder strength, dimerization amplitude, and lead-ring connectivity, collectively shape transport characteristics. Notably, asymmetric lead couplings are shown to enhance performance by leveraging quantum interference pathways. Our findings highlight a robust design strategy for optimizing nanoscale thermoelectric functionality, providing actionable insights for experimental realization in molecular electronic platforms.</p>

            <p>Spontaneous formation of charge density wave (CDW) superstructures in monolayers (MLs) of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal lattice is fundamental in understanding its complex quantum states. We report a successful top-down liquid phase exfoliation and stamp transfer process (LPESTP) to create ML VS\textsubscript{2}, undergoing a CDW transition at room temperature. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED), we observed the coexistence of 1T and 2H polymorphic phases in VS\textsubscript{2} at room temperature, and only the 1T phase undergoes CDW transition. We discovered a novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R19.1\textsuperscript{o} in ML 1T-VS\textsubscript{2}. With an increase in the number of layers, the CDW order changes to a commensurate ($2 \times 2\times 1$) superstructure. Using angle-dependent photoelectron spectroscopy and TEM, we have shown that vanadium atoms self-intercalate as V\textsuperscript{3+} ions in multilayer VS\textsubscript{2} and are responsible for the evolution of the CDW superstructure from the incommensurate ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R 19.1\textsuperscript{o} to the commensurate ($2\times2\times1$) order. We also report the observation of novel Moiré superlattices in twisted bilayer 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} flakes with trapped CDW superstructure of the monolayer. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation performed on ML 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} show that the observed ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R 19.1\textsuperscript{o} CDW superstructure has lower energy compared to that of the pristine undistorted ML and the CDW instability is driven by formation of strong soft-phonon modes. Our findings provide an important platform for understanding the evolution of CDW superstructures in 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} with layer numbers and V self-intercalation.</p>

            <p>Research on energy transport has advanced in recent years with the emergence of transient microscopy techniques that allow for imaging of carriers with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this context, transient scattering microscopy (TScM), has emerged as an alternative to traditional techniques. However, the sensitivity of TScM to different carriers can complicate the interpretation of results, highlighting the need to develop models tailored to TScM. Here, TScM is used to visualize exciton transport in bulk TMDCs. We show that exciton populations exhibit non-Gaussian profiles by analyzing the their excess kurtosis. Numerical simulations incorporating anomalous diffusion -- such as Auger recombination and trap states -- reproduce these experimental observations. Furthermore, by tuning the injected carrier density, we demonstrate that the temporal signature of the kurtosis is distinct for Auger-dominated and trap-dominated regimes. Additionally, we find that traditional Gaussian-fitting methods can yield inconsistent results for the extracted diffusivities. As an alternative, we implement a discrete variable calculation which yields robust, consistent diffusivity values. Our results establish kurtosis as a vital diagnostic parameter for identifying anomolous diffusion and demonstrate the necessity of moving beyond Gaussian approximations for accurate analysis of TScM data.</p>

            <p>We experimentally investigate the rheology of dark chocolate pastes in both industrially relevant pre-refined form and simplified model systems. Steady and oscillatory shear experiments reveal yielding, pronounced shear-thinning, and stress-dependent hysteresis governed by solid loading. Fitting the viscosity data with the Maron-Pierce model provides stress-dependent maximum flowable fractions $\phi_{\rm{m}}(\sigma)$, defining yield loci in the $(\phi, \sigma)$ plane. Their variation with stress quantifies the coupled roles of friction and adhesion in setting flow limits. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear tests characterize transitions from elastic to viscous behavior and identify distinct recovery pathways near jamming. Contact-stress decomposition separates hydrodynamic and frictional contributions, confirming that adhesive contact networks dominate stress transmission in pre-refined pastes. These results establish chocolate pastes as dense, adhesive suspensions whose flow is controlled by the interplay of friction and adhesion, offering quantitative benchmarks for constitutive modeling and linking chocolate processing to the broader physics of constraint rheology.</p>

            <h2>Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qile Wu, Seamus D. O Hara, Joseph B. Costello, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Ken W. West, Mark S. Sherwin</p>
            <p>Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 13\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fröhlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.</p>

            <h2>Correlated electronic structure and local spin in lead-copper-vanadium-bromine apatite: a DMFT study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ihor Sukhenko, Volodymyr Karbivskyy</p>
            <p>We study the correlated electronic structure and local spin behaviour of the copper-substituted lead-vanadium bromine apatite Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ using DFT+DMFT with a two-orbital Cu-centred low-energy model. Simulations are done for several temperatures (20, 60, 100 K) and a broad range of band fillings 2.46 $\leq$ n $\leq$ 3.54. We find that the present compound stays metallic even once correlations are treated dynamically around the stoichiometric filling (n $\simeq$ 3). Away from n $\simeq$ 3, both hole and electron doping drive the system toward non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, and spectral weight is transferred from the low-energy peak into upper and lower Hubbard-like features. By analysing the low-frequency self-energy exponent and the dynamical part of the local spin susceptibility, we identify a narrow window of enhanced spin fluctuations on the slightly hole-doped side (n $\simeq$ 2.94), i.e. a spin-freezing-crossover regime of the kind reported in the literature for multiorbital Hund metals. This places Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ among the promising members of the Cu-substituted apatite family.</p>

            <h2>Supernematic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Mao, Eun-Ah Kim</p>
            <p>Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thales F. Macedo, Julián Faúndez, Antônio S. Coelho, Caio Lewenkopf, Mauro S. Ferreira, Felipe A. Pinheiro, Natanael C. Costa</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum inverse problems in one-dimensional (1D) electronic disordered systems strongly coupled to optical cavities. More specifically, we consider the Anderson and the Aubry-Andre-Harper models connected to electronic reservoirs and embedded in a single-mode optical cavity. The light-matter interaction enables photon-assisted hopping processes that significantly modify the transmittance spectrum. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we implement an inversion-based approach capable of accurately extracting the electron-photon coupling strength directly from transmittance spectra. While cavity coupling acts as a minor perturbation within the Anderson model, yielding broad yet precise parameter estimates, its influence is markedly different in the Aubry-André-Harper model. The latter exhibits a sharp metal-insulator transition in 1D, thus resulting in more pronounced cavity-induced spectral changes. This renders even more accurate inverse solutions, offering unparalleled precision in the characterization of low-dimensional disordered systems. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the quantum inverse problem provides a robust diagnostic tool for quantum materials, particularly effective for systems exhibiting metal-insulator transitions.</p>

            <p>Emerging granularity in superconducting films by tuning disorder is a well-studied topic, both theoretically and experimentally. However, the orbital magnetic field generates a vortex lattice and contributes to the formation of periodic inhomogeneities. Here, we study superconducting films in the simultaneous presence of disorder and a magnetic field, examining how inhomogeneities in various superconducting correlations evolve under these two perturbations. By performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on thin films of \ce{Sr2VO_{3-\text{x}}FeAs} layer structures under both zero and finite orbital magnetic fields, we report impressive similarities between our theoretical results and the experimental findings. Our results have strong implications for identifying the nature of vortices in disordered superconductors, demonstrating a crossover from Abrikosov to Josephson character with increasing disorder, and provide predictive guidance for interpreting STS and current mapping data in complex superconductors.</p>

            <p>The tunable mechanical response of knitted fabrics underpins applications ranging from soft robotics and artificial muscles to morphing electromagnetic field sensors. Elasticity in fabrics emerges from the bending of yarn in the knitted structure; however, properties beyond elasticity are relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that knitted fabrics subjected to cyclic uniaxial stress exhibit significant hysteresis and the remarkable ability to "remember" their response to previous deformations -- reminiscent of classical return point memory in magnetic systems. The hysteretic behavior deviates from the two standard models of hysteresis that usually apply to solid-state materials, viscoelasticity and plasticity. Thus, we develop a phenomenological extension of the Preisach model of hysteresis which well replicates our data, and discuss implications of these results on the underlying mechanisms of memory in knitted fabrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Balazs Toth, Adam Gali, Gergo Thiering</p>
            <p>Trigonal solid-state defects are often subjects of spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by the $E\otimes e$ Jahn-Teller effect, reflecting strong electron-phonon coupling. These systems, particularly paramagnetic defect qubits in solids are central for quantum technology applications, where accurate knowledge of their fine-structure parameters $-$ shaped by the complex interplay of spin-orbit and electron-phonon interactions $-$ is essential. We introduce the this http URL code part of the jahn-teller-dynamics package, a Python code that implements the first-principles approach of [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021063 (2018)] to accurately compute the spin-orbit-phonon entanglement in trigonal defects utilizing the output from density functional theory calculations (DFT). By employing $\Delta$SCF calculations, the method extends naturally to excited states and predicts fine-structure parameters of zero-phonon lines (ZPLs), including Zeeman shifts under external magnetic fields. The approach is applicable not only to solid-state defects but also to Jahn-Teller active trigonal molecules such as the $X$CH$_3$ family. We demonstrate the capabilities of this http URL through applications to negatively charged Group-IV$-$vacancy (G4V) defects in diamond: SiV$^-$, GeV$^-$, SnV$^-$, PbV$^-$ and the neutral N$_3$V$^0$ defect in diamond, and the CH$_3$O methoxy radical.</p>

            <p>Magnetic flux quantization in units of $\Phi_0 = h/2e$ is a defining feature of superconductivity, rooted in the charge-2e nature of Cooper pairs. In a ring geometry, the flux quantization leads to oscillations in the critical temperature with magnetic flux, known as the Little-Parks effect. While the maximal critical temperature is conventionally at zero flux, departures from this rule, for instance shifts by a half-quantum flux $\Phi_0/2$, clearly signal unconventional superconducting states and require sign-changing order parameters. Historically, such $\pi$-phase shifts in Little-Parks oscillations have been found in tricrystals or engineered ring structures that intentionally incorporate a $\pi$-phase shift. Here we report the discovery of switchable half-quantum flux states in rings made from single crystals of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We observe Little-Parks oscillations with a $\pi$-phase shift at zero bias current, which can be reversibly tuned to conventional Little-Parks oscillations upon applying a bias current. Between the $\pi$-phase and 0-phase regimes, $h/4e$ periodic oscillations appear. Our observations suggest unconventional pairing, potentially in the form of a multicomponent order parameter in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and reveal an electrically tunable landscape of competing superconducting condensates and fractional flux states.</p>

A $G$-type-like antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Mn on the $A'$ sites and a `up--up--down--down' AFM moment configuration of Mn spins on the $B$ sites is found to occur. The mechanism for the onset and stabilization of $B$ site `up--up--down--down' AFM order is explored in terms of coupling between structural and magnetic distortions. The results presented here provide evidence of the exotic charge, orbital, electronic and magnetic orderings that quadruple manganite perovskites demonstrate, and further highlighting the distinct chemistry that Hg$^{2+}$ plays in stabilizing novel states compared to other divalent $A$-site cation equivalents.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Non-thermal pairing glue of electrons in the steady state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Pini, Christian H. Johansen, Francesco Piazza</p>
            <p>The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic high-throughput density-functional-theory investigation of the structural and magnetic stability of 312 substitutional compounds in the magnetic kagome AT6X6 family. Our screening confirms the stability of many previously reported structures and predicts several additional stable candidates. Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena.</p>

            <p>We present an experimental and theoretical study of 2-D swarms in which collective behavior emerges from both direct local mechanical coupling between agents and from the exchange and processing of information between agents. Each agent, an air-table drone endowed with internal memory and a binary decision variable, updates its state by integrating a time series of memories of local past collisions. This internal computation transforms the drone swarm into a dynamical information network in which history-dependent feedback drives spontaneous complete spin polarization, pitchfork bifurcated spin collectives, and chaotic switching between collective states. By tuning the depth of memory and the decision algorithm, we uncover a memory-induced phase transition that breaks spin symmetry at the population level. A minimal theoretical model maps these dynamics onto an effective potential landscape sculpted by informational feedback, revealing how temporally correlated computation can replace instantaneous forces as the driver of collective organization, informed by experiments. These results position physically interacting drone swarms as a model system for exploring the physics of informational drone ensembles whose emergent behavior arises from the interplay between physical interaction and information processing.</p>

            <p>Sharma and Bhosale [\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N>12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.</p>

We implement optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol and randomized measurement protocol tailored for IBM quantum computers' limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, we employ quantum multi-programming that parallelizes circuit execution to improve the results obtained by the randomized measurement protocol. Finally, by incorporating the quantum error mitigation techniques into our implementation of the entropy measurement protocols on IBM quantum hardware, we show that the current noisy quantum computer can yield results aligned with theoretical expectations, therefore affirming its capability to explore chaotic quantum dynamics in complex quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim</p>
            <p>A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</p>

            <p>The strong coupling between light and matter gives rise to polaritons. Further coupling polaritons to phonons leads to the formation of hybrid polaromechanical systems. Recent experiments have achieved the strong coupling between polaritons and phonons in two configurations, namely, the magnon-photon-phonon and exciton-photon-phonon systems, which enables the control of mechanical motion via manipulating polaritons. Here, we present a polaromechanical cooling theory and explicitly show how two polaritons can be used to simultaneously cool two mechanical modes. The unique advantage of our protocol lies in the fact that the continuous tunability of the polariton frequencies over a wide range allows for the cooling of any two mechanical modes with their frequency difference falling within this range. We further discuss how to extend the theory to cool multiple mechanical modes. The protocol is designed for cooling mechanical motion in various emerging polaromechanical platforms, such as magnon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaromechanical systems, which is the first step towards quantum states generation in these hybrid systems.</p>

            <p>A quantum Parisi formula for the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is proven with an elementary mathematical method. First, a self-overlap corrected quantum model of the transverse field SK model is represented in terms of the Hamiltonian with annealed random interactions. The interpolation given by Guerra and Toninelli is extended to the self-overlap corrected quantum model. It is proven that the infinite-volume limit of the free energy density exists in the operator formalism. Next, another interpolation developed by Guerra and Talagrand is applied to obtain a finite step replica-symmetry breaking (RSB) bound on the free energy density in the transverse field SK model. The interpolation enables us to show that the deviation of the RSB solution from the exact solution vanishes in the self-overlap corrected quantum model in a functional representation of the quantum spin operators. Finally, the corrected terms are removed by the Hopf-Lax formula for a nonlinear partial differential equation to show the quantum Parisi formula for the original transverse field SK model. The formula is extended to that for the transverse field mean-field $p$-spin glass model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lavoisier Wah, Remmy Zen, Flore K. Kunst</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems have emerged as a powerful framework for describing open quantum systems, non-equilibrium dynamics, and engineered quantum optical materials. However, solving the ground-state properties of NH systems is challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space, and exotic phenomena such as the emergence of exceptional points. Another challenge arises from the limitations of traditional methods like exact diagonalization (ED). For the past decade, neural networks (NNs) have shown promise in approximating many-body wavefunctions, yet their application to NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we explore different NN architectures to investigate the ground-state properties of a parity-time-symmetric, one-dimensional NH, transverse field Ising model with a complex spectrum by employing a recurrent neural network (RNN), a restricted Boltzmann machine~(RBM), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). We construct the NN-based many-body wavefunctions and validate our approach by recovering the ground-state properties of the model for small system sizes, finding excellent agreement with ED. Furthermore, for larger system sizes, we demonstrate that the RNN outperforms both the RBM and MLP. However, we show that the accuracy of the RBM and MLP can be significantly improved through transfer learning, allowing them to perform comparably to the RNN for larger system sizes. These results highlight the potential of neural network-based approaches--particularly for accurately capturing the low-energy physics of NH quantum systems in case of both weak and strong non-Hermiticity.</p>

Using mean-field expansion of the equation of state near criticality, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$. We show that the monopole parameter shifts the critical parameters but does not change the mean-field universal scaling: the leading linear term and the nonanalytic correction remain universal in both ensembles.

            <h2>Turbulent Flows in Electron Hydrodynamics: Conductivity and Vorticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kanad Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>In this article, we attempt to understand various aspects of turbulent flows in electron hydrodynamics. We analyze a rectangular channel geometry in the presence of an electric field and a Corbino geometry in the presence of a magnetic field. In the former geometry, we analyze the conductivity of the fluid as well as the frequency spectrum of perturbations about the Poiseuille flow. While the normal Poiseuille flow has an associated conductivity which scales as $W^2$, we find a correction which scales as $W^4$ in the case of non-linear flows, where $W$ is the characteristic length of the system. In the Corbino geometry, we analyze the velocity, vorticity and magnetic fields. We find that the vorticity can span across a wide range near the edge of the geometry, a behavior that can be reflected in the velocity and magnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Attention-Based Foundation Model for Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothy Zaklama, Daniele Guerci, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>We present an attention-based foundation model architecture for learning and predicting quantum states across Hamiltonian parameters, system sizes, and physical systems. Using only basis configurations and physical parameters as inputs, our trained neural network is able to produce highly accurate ground state wavefunctions. For example, we build the phase diagram for the 2D square-lattice $t-V$ model with $N$ particles, from only 18 parameters $(V/t,N)$. Thus, our architecture provides a basis for building a universal foundation model for quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Advancing the chemical synthesis of crystals is important for both fundamental research and practical applications of quantum materials. While established bulk-phase and thin-film growth methods have enabled enormous progress, synthesizing single crystals suitable for quantum electronic discoveries remains challenging for many emerging materials. Here, we introduce van der Waals (vdW) stacks as nanochemical reactors for single-crystal synthesis and demonstrate their broad applicability in growing both elemental and compound crystals at the micrometer scale. By encapsulating atomically thin reactants that are stacked compactly with inert vdW layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we achieve nanoconfined synthesis with the resulting crystals remaining encapsulated. As proof of concept, we synthesized isolated single crystals of elemental tellurium and distinct types of Pd-Te compounds. Structural characterization, including atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, confirms the high crystalline quality of the products. We confirm the intrinsic semiconducting gap of tellurium and observe that non-stoichiometric PdTe1-x with a significantly reduced Te content (x ~ 0.18, a regime not previously achieved) retains uniform crystallinity and exhibits superconductivity below a critical temperature of 3.8 K. This nanochemical synthesis is broadly generalizable, chip-integrable, well-suited to a wide range of processing conditions, and compatible with nanofabrication routines for constructing devices. The concept of vdW nanoreactors offers a powerful and versatile pathway to expand the accessible landscape of quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Perturbative Input-Output Theory of Floquet Cavity Magnonics and Magnon Energy Shifts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Aguiar, M. C. de Oliveira</p>
            <p>We develop a perturbative input-output formalism to compute the reflectance and transmittance spectra of cavity magnonics systems subject to a Floquet modulation. The method exploits the strong hierarchy between the magnetic-dipole couplings transverse (drive field) and parallel (modulation field) to the static bias field, which naturally introduces the small parameter $\epsilon = (2Ns)^{-1/2}$ associated with the total spin $Ns$ of the ferromagnet. By organizing the cavity and magnon fields in a systematic expansion in $\epsilon$, we obtain compact analytic expressions for the spectra up to second order. Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\,\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field. This identifies a measurable and previously overlooked shift relevant for the interpretation and design of cavity magnonics experiments.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Quantum Photonic Platform Based on Site-Controlled Quantum Dots Coupled to Circular Bragg Grating Resonators</h2>

            <p>The scalable integration of solid-state quantum emitters into photonic nanostructures remains a central challenge for quantum photonic technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust and streamlined integration strategy that tackles the long-standing issue of deterministic fabrication on randomly positioned self-assembled quantum dots (QDs), leveraging a buried-stressor-based site-controlled InGaAs QD platform. We show that this deterministic growth approach enables precise spatial alignment with circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators for enhanced emission, eliminating the need for complex and time-consuming deterministic lithography techniques. We fabricated a $6\times6$ SCQD-CBG array with 100\% device yield, with 35 devices falling within the radial-offset range where the simulated photon-extraction efficiency (PEE) exceeds 20\%, underscoring the spatial precision and scalability of our fabrication concept. A systematically selected subset of five devices with varying radial displacements reveals clear offset-dependent trends in extraction efficiency, spectral linewidth, and photon indistinguishability, thereby establishing quantitative bounds on spatial alignment tolerances. In the best-aligned QD-CBG device, we achieve a PEE of $(47.1\pm3.8)\%$, a linewidth of $(1.41\pm0.22)$ GHz, a radiative decay lifetime of $(0.80\pm0.02)$~ns, a single-photon purity of $(99.58\pm0.18)\%$, and a Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference visibility of $(81\pm5)\%$ under quasi-resonant excitation at saturation power. We confirm our conceptual understanding of the effect of emitter-position dependent charge-noise fluctuations in terms of a quantum-optical model for the (quantum-)emission properties.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-assisted topological pumping in few- and many-atom Rydberg arrays</h2>

            <p>Topology can imbue lattice systems with special properties, notably the presence of robust eigenstates living at their boundary. Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Rational Design Principles for Na- and Li-ion Carbon Anodes from Interlayer Spacing Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ihor Radchenko (1), Oleksandr I. Malyi (1 and 2) ((1) Centre of Excellence ENSEMBLE3 Sp. z o. o., (2) Qingyuan Innovation Laboratory)</p>
            <p>Graphite, the standard commercial anode for Li-ion batteries, is thermodynamically incompatible with Na-ion batteries, leading researchers to search for alternative C-based structures (e.g., hard carbon, expanded graphite). In a simplified picture, the main idea of such search relies on identifying disordered C structures with a large interlayer spacing and distribution of local structural motifs (e.g., pores) with target electrochemical properties. Such exploration is typically done via trial-and-error experimentation, which often does not allow precise understanding of the role of interlayer distance and even Na/Li-ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance. Motivated by this, using density-functional theory and cluster expansion, we establish a structure-property relationship for Li- and Na-intercalation across a range of graphite interlayer spacings and stacking arrangements. We show that Na intercalation becomes thermodynamically possible in large concentrations above 4.21 Å even without a change in interlayer spacing. Conversely, Li intercalation has a narrow optimal window, with maximum capacity (close to the commercial limit) at approximately 3.75 Å, while larger spacings (e.g., 4.58 Å) quickly reduce Li storage capacity. We also find that AA-stacked domains consistently offer stronger ion bonding and higher voltages than AB-stacked domains for both ions. Our results, thus, not only explain the role of metal ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance, but also clarify the fundamental design trade-offs for expanded C anodes, offering practical targets and interlayer distance ranges for the independent optimization of the next generation of negative electrodes for metal-ion batteries.</p>

            <h2>Many-Body Correlation Effects in Fröhlich Electron-Phonon Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zien Zhu, Chih-En Hsu, Benran Zhang, Zhenfa Zheng, Mauro Del Ben, Antonios M. Alvertis, Hung-Chung Hsueh, Zhenglu Li</p>
            <p>In compound semiconductors and insulators, the polar electron-phonon coupling diverges at long range, known as the Fröhlich interaction. Modern first-principles electron-phonon calculations treat the Fröhlich interaction in a semiclassical electrostatic formalism based on density-functional perturbation theory. Here, using many-body $GW$ perturbation theory, we reveal important electron correlation effects in the Fröhlich-type electron-phonon coupling, which are missed by the prevailing approaches. Going beyond the electrostatic treatment, we derive and implement the $GW$ self-energy contribution to the long-range polar electron-phonon coupling, and demonstrate its critical role and nontrivial behaviors in properties such as electron linewidth and polaron formation. Our work establishes the many-body generalization of the Fröhlich interaction that is essential for accurate electron-phonon calculations at the full $GW$ level combined with Wannier interpolation techniques.</p>

            <h2>Strain-induced quantum oscillation in Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana-Fermi surface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takayuki Yokoyama, Yasuhiro Tada</p>
            <p>We theoretically study Landau quantization of itinerant Majorana quasiparticles induced by lattice strain in a Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana Fermi surfaces. We consider the isotropic spin-1/2 Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with a perturbation such as a staggered Zeeman field and an electromagnetic field, which generates small Majorana Fermi surfaces near the Dirac points. By introducing triaxial strain, we create an effective vector potential that couples to Majorana fermions and leads to Landau quantization. Our calculations show that the low-energy spectrum forms discrete pseudo-Landau levels of the Majorana Fermi surface. We further demonstrate that the strain-induced effective vector potential gives rise to pronounced quantum oscillations of the density of states and the specific heat at very low temperatures, in close analogy to the de Haas-van Alphen effect for charged electrons in metals. These results indicate that Landau-quantization-driven "Majorana quantum oscillations" can serve as a probe of the charge-neutral Majorana Fermi surface in Kitaev materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srimanta Middey, Nandana Bhattacharya, Rukma Nevgi, Suresh Chandra Joshi, Subha Dey</p>
            <p>Perovskite oxides ($AB$O$_3$) have long been central to the advancement of modern condensed matter physics, owing to their rich and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. The quest to understand their various entangled phases has spurred the development of both cutting-edge experimental tools and innovative theoretical frameworks. In recent times, the emergence of high entropy oxides - materials in which five or more elements share a single crystallographic site - has introduced a powerful new paradigm in materials design. Embedding such extreme chemical disorder within the perovskite framework has opened vast opportunities for realizing novel physical phenomena inaccessible in conventional oxides. This review surveys the rapid advances in the synthesis, characterization, and exploration of the electronic and magnetic properties of compositionally complex perovskite oxides, offering key insights and highlighting promising avenues for future research.</p>

            <h2>From chessboard of bipolarons of size 4a in cubic La7/8Sr1/8MnO3 to stripes of the same bipolarons in layered high Tc cuprates</h2>

            <p>The compound La1-xSrxMnO3 exhibits a charge order (CO) state at $x\approx 1/8$ and $T<T_{co}$, which recalls the CO state with a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting transition, $T_c$, observed in all cuprates at this doping value. Local excitations of lattice and magnetic origins measured in the two-dimensional metallic state of La7/8Sr1/8MnO3 reveal the existence of bipolarons of size $4a$ resulting from structural and antiferromagnetic pairings of hole-rich orbital polarons of size $2a$. They are intertwined with hole-poor domains in a disordered state at $T>T_{co}$ which become ordered on a chessboard organized in a 3D-order state of ferromagnetically paired polarons at $T<T_{co}$. Applied to the CuO$_2$ planes of the cuprates of the "214" family, this model produces stripes of bipolarons intertwined with stripes of antiferromagnetically arranged spins, hole-poor, both of size $4a$, leading to a spin density wave with a wave vector $\delta=1/8$, a charge density wave with $q=1/4$, the Yamada laws $\delta(x)=x$ and $T_c\propto \delta$ and a decrease of $T_c$ at x=1/8. This work invokes relevance of a bipolaronic origin of high $T_c$ superconductivity, in which bipolarons of size $4a$ can play a major role.</p>

            <h2>Discriminating Gap Symmetries of Superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhan Wang, Yuxin Wang, Kun Jiang, Jiangping Hu, Fu-Chun Zhang</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductor in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate materials represented by La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has opened new directions in the quest for unconventional superconductivity. A central unresolved issue concerns the pairing symmetry of the superconducting order. In this paper, we model the superconducting order of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the established Fermi surface structure together with phenomenological pairing functions belonging to $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave symmetry classes, which are the leading possibilities in the current debate. We compute several experimentally accessible observables-including tunneling density of states, point contact spectroscopy, superfluid density, and Raman spectroscopy-each of which exhibits distinct characteristics for different gap symmetries. These quantities provide a concrete and experimentally testable route for identifying the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and for clarifying the microscopic nature of nickelate superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu</p>
            <p>The magnetoelectric coupling effect serves as a crucial bridge between electrical and magnetic order parameters in condensed matter physics, forming the physical basis for the development of next-generation low-power information storage and sensing technologies. However, material systems exhibiting this effect at room temperature are extremely rare, and the coupling strength is typically very weak, which has long hindered the practical application of such phenomena despite their rich tunability. Here, we break this by reporting a pronounced magnetoelectric phenomenon,the magnetically coupled EO effect in the classic ferroelectric optical materials LiNbO3 and LiTaO3. We trace its origin to an unexpected source,the problematic direct current drift,a major reliability issue in photonic integrated circuits. We unambiguously demonstrate that this drift stems not from mobile ions but from defect-bound unpaired electrons, whose slow polarization relaxation is quenched upon the magnetic-field-induced formation of a room-temperature skyrmion states, as directly visualized by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. This collective spin ordering not only solves the decades-old drift problem but also transforms the defect states into a magnetically responsive platform, exhibiting an efficiency up to 34 pm/V in LiNbO3 and 15 pm/V in LiTaO3-an orders-of-magnitude enhancement over conventional room-temperature magnetoelectric responses and even surpassing the materials' intrinsic Pockels coefficients. We also measured the magnetic response of this additional electro-optical effect and found that under the condition of applying a magnetic field of 0.1 T, an electro-optical coefficient adjustment of about 8 pm/V can be achieved (0.008 pm/V/Oe), which is equivalent to 30% of the electro-optical coefficient of LiNbO3 itself.</p>

            <h2>Observation of a Stripe/nematic Phase of Composite Fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengyu Wang, Siddharth K. Singh, Chia-Tse Tai, Adbhut Gupta, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Kirk W. Baldwin, Mansour Shayegan</p>
            <p>Electronic stripe/nematic phases are fascinating strongly-correlated states characterized by spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking. In the quantum Hall regime, such phases typically emerge at half-filled, high-orbital-index ($N\geq2$) Landau levels (LLs) where the short-range Coulomb interaction is softened by the nodes of electron wave functions. In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected. Instead, composite fermion (CF) liquids and fractional quantum Hall states, which are well explained in the picture of weakly interacting CF quasiparticles, are favored. Here we report the observation of an unexpected stripe/nematic phase in the \textit{lowest} LL at filling factor $\nu=5/8$ in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional \textit{hole} systems, evinced by a pronounced in-plane transport anisotropy. Remarkably, $\nu=5/8$ can be mapped to a half-filled, high-index CF LL ($N_{\text{CF}}=2$), analogous to the $N=2$ hole LL. Our finding signals a novel stripe/nematic phase of CFs, driven by the residual long-range interaction among these emergent quasiparticles. This phase is surprisingly robust, surviving up to $\sim$100 mK. Its absence in electron-type systems suggests that severe LL mixing stemming from the large hole effective mass and non-linear LL fan diagram plays a crucial role in modifying the CF-CF interaction.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) diamond has aroused tremendous interest in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, owing to its superior properties and flexible characteristics compared to bulk diamond. Despite significant efforts, great challenges lie in the experimental synthesis and transformation conditions of 2D diamond. Herein, we have demonstrated the experimental preparation of high quality 2D diamond with controlled thickness and distinguished properties, realized by laser-heating few-layer graphene in diamond anvil cell. The quenched 2D diamond exhibited narrow T2g Raman peak (linewidth ~3.6 cm-1) and intense photoluminescence of SiV- (linewidth ~6.1 nm) and NV0 centers. In terms of transformation mechanism, atomic structures of hybrid phase interfaces suggested that the intermediate rhombohedral phase subtly mediate hexagonal graphite to cubic diamond transition. Furthermore, the tunable optical bandgap and thermal stability of 2D diamond sensitively depend on its sp3 concentration. We believe our results can shed light on the structural design and preparation of many carbon allotropes and further uncover the underlying transition mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Predicting the Thermal Conductivity Collapse in SWCNT Bundles: The Interplay of Symmetry Breaking and Scattering Revealed by Machine-Learning-Driven Quantum Transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Tao, Xiaoliang Zhang, Dawei Tang, Shigeo Maruyama, Ya Feng</p>
            <p>We combine machine learning (ML)-based neuroevolution potentials (NEP) with anharmonic lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation (ALD-BTE) to achieve a quantitative and mode-resolved description of thermal transport in individual (10, 0) zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their bundles. Our analysis reveals a dual mechanism behind the drastic suppression of thermal conductivity in bundles: first, the breaking of rotational symmetry in isolated SWCNTs dramatically enhances the scattering rates of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes, such as the twist (TW) mode. Second, the emergence of new inter-tube phonon modes introduces abundant additional scattering channels across the entire frequency spectrum. Crucially, the incorporation of quantum Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics is essential to accurately capture these phenomena, enabling our approach to quantitatively reproduce experimental observations. This work establishes the combination of ML-driven interatomic potentials and ALD-BTE as a predictive framework for nanoscale thermal transport, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. Li, W. Zeng, R. Shen</p>
            <p>Monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ exhibits spin- and valley-dependent massive tilted Dirac cones with two velocity correction terms in low-energy effective Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate the longitudinal diffusive magneto-conductivity of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ by using the linear response theory. It is shown that the Weiss oscillations are polarized in spin and valley degrees of freedom, under uniform electric fields and a weak one-dimensional spatially-periodic electrostatic potential modulation. The spin polarization, the valley polarization and the spin-valley polarization can be switched by flipping the external electric fields. The polarization is found not only in the amplitudes but also in the periods of the Weiss oscillations. It is found that the period polarization in Weiss oscillations originates from the polarized effective Fermi energies or the polarized Landau level spacing scales. In Weiss oscillations, polarization in amplitude does not imply the presence of polarization in period, whereas polarization in period is accompanied by polarization in amplitude. The superposition of polarization in amplitude and polarization in period enables the appearance of considerable polarization in Weiss oscillations under relatively weak external electric fields.</p>
