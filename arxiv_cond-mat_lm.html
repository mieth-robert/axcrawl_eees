            <h2>Curvature-Guided Mechanics and Design of Spinodal and Shell-Based Architected Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Somayajulu Dhulipala, Carlos M. Portela</p>
            <p>Additively manufactured (AM) architected materials have enabled unprecedented control over mechanical properties of engineered materials. While lattice architectures have played a key role in these advances, they suffer from stress concentrations at sharp joints and bending-dominated behavior at high relative densities, limiting their mechanical efficiency. Additionally, high-resolution AM techniques often result in low-throughput or costly fabrication, restricting manufacturing scalability of these materials. Aperiodic spinodal architected materials offer a promising alternative by leveraging low-curvature architectures that can be fabricated through techniques beyond AM. Enabled by phase separation processes, these architectures exhibit tunable mechanical properties and enhanced defect tolerance by tailoring their curvature distributions. However, the relation between curvature and their anisotropic mechanical behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the role of curvature in governing the anisotropic stiffness and strength of shell-based spinodal architected materials. We introduce geometric metrics that predict the distribution of stretching and bending energies under different loading conditions, bridging the gap between curvature in doubly curved shell-based morphologies and their mechanical anisotropy. We validate our framework through finite element simulations and microscale experiments, demonstrating its utility in designing mechanically robust spinodal architectures. This study provides fundamental insights into curvature-driven mechanics, guiding the optimization of next-generation architected materials for engineering applications.</p>

            <h2>Triplon Bose-Einstein condensation and proximate magnetism in dimerized antiferromagnets</h2>

            <p>Dimerized quantum magnets provide a useful arena for novel quantum states and phases transitions with the singlet-triplet type of triplon excitations. Here we study the triplon physics and the Bose-Einstein condensation in two isostructural dimerized antiferromagnets $A$Cu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ ($A$ = Hg, Cd). With the systematic measurements, we demonstrate a dimer singlet ground state in HgCu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ with a triplon gap $\sim$ 7.9 K and a triplon Bose-Einstein condensation with an antiferromagnetic order in CdCu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ below 4.4 K. We further adopt the bond-operator technique and show that the elemental replacement preserves the Hamiltonian and allows the study in a unified theoretical framework with tunable interdimer and intradimer interactions on the opposite sides of the quantum critical point. With the peculiar Cu$_2$O$_8$ dimer configuration and effective ferromagnetic interdimer interaction, $A$Cu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ is distinguished from other $S$ = 1/2 dimerized antiferromagnets. Our results represent a global understanding of the magnetic ground states as well as the magnetic transitions in the dimerized magnets of this unusual crystal structure.</p>

            <h2>Family of Multilayer Graphene Superconductors with Tunable Chirality: Momentum-Space Vortices Forged in the Berry-Ring of Fire</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adarsh S. Patri, Marcel Franz</p>
            <p>Recent experiments in rhombohedrally-stacked multilayer graphene heterostructures have reported signatures of chiral superconductivity, emerging from a spin and valley-polarized normal state with broken time-reversal symmetry and an associated anomalous Hall effect. These findings bring into focus the role of the electronic Bloch wavefunction and the quantum geometric tensor in determining the superconducting pairing channel. In this work, we examine superconducting instabilities of a model of $N$-layer rhombohedral graphene that possesses an enhanced Berry curvature distribution on an extended ring in momentum space $-$ that we dub the 'Berry-ring of fire' $-$ in the presence of an isotropic attractive interaction with a parametrically controlled spatial range. We determine that local interactions favor a $N$-fold winding in the order parameter phase for odd-$N$ layered systems, with even-$N$ layers requiring a spatially extended attraction range to achieve pairing. For generic interaction lengths, we discover a family of chiral superconductors and, remarkably, momentum-space vortices nucleated on the Berry-ring of fire. The existence of these vortices can be traced to a momentum-space flux quantization condition involving the Berry curvature, with the phase winding dictated by a combination of the Berry flux and a 'statistical flux' to enforce Fermi-Dirac statistics. Such an order parameter structure allows for the possibility of in-situ tuning between various chiral superconducting phases through changes in the electron density or the displacement field. We discuss ways in which these predictions can be experimentally tested and potentially exploited in future devices.</p>

            <h2>Interplay between Hund's rule and Kondo effect in a quantum dot</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olfa Dani, Johannes C. Bayer, Timo Wagner, Gertrud Zwicknagl, Rolf J. Haug</p>
            <p>The interaction between localized spins on a quantum dot and free electrons in the reservoirs forms a many-particle entangled system giving rise to the Kondo effect. Here, we investigate electron transport in the third shell of a gate-defined GaAs quantum dot. The addition energy shows a maximum at half-filling of the shell which can be described analytically with Hund's rule exchange interaction. For 7 to 11 electrons occupying the quantum dot Zero-bias anomalies characteristic for the Kondo effect are observed, but with unexpected widths. Here the quantum dot has to be described as a multi-orbital Kondo impurity with Hund's interaction. In this way this quantum dot can be seen as a model system for a Hund's coupled mixed-valence quantum impurity as appearing in Hund's metals where local ferromagnetic interactions between orbitals lead to the emergence of complex electronic states.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic $2π$ domain walls for tunable Majorana devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Hauck, Stefan Rex, Markus Garst</p>
            <p>Identifying realistic platforms capable of controlled operations with Majorana bound states is a key challenge in the study of topological superconductivity. Among the most promising proposals are magnet-superconductor hybrid devices, which employ magnetic textures to engineer regions of non-trivial topology. Here, we consider the remarkably simple case of $2\pi$ domain walls in a magnetic ribbon placed on a superconducting substrate. We show that for properly chosen parameters, such domain walls generate topological quasi-one dimensional superconducting wires and give rise to localized Majorana bound states at the ribbon edges. Magnetic $2\pi$ domain walls are easily created and controlled with existing experimental techniques, thus providing a versatile platform for Majorana manipulations.</p>

            <h2>Theory of itinerant collisional spin dynamics in nondegenerate molecular gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reuben R. W. Wang, John L. Bohn</p>
            <p>We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Exact Quantum Many-Body Scars in 2D Quantum Gauge Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Miao, Linhao Li, Hosho Katsura, Masahito Yamazaki</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.</p>

            <h2>Universal principles for sudden-quench quantum Otto engines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. S. Watson, K. V. Kheruntsyan</p>
            <p>We apply a simple sudden quench approximation for the unitary work strokes of a quantum Otto engine in order to provide a general analysis of its performance, applicable to arbitrary quantum models with two-body interactions. This work extends recent results for an interaction-driven Otto cycle to generic many-body interacting quantum models, providing universal bounds on their operation efficiency. From this, we demonstrate that the net work of such an engine cycle is determined entirely by interparticle correlations. Applications are demonstrated for a handful of paradigmatic many-body quantum models, including a novel engine -- with a spin-1/2 Fermi gas with contact two-body interactions as its working medium -- in which we leverage control over spin polarization to greatly enhance its performance compared to the unpolarized case. We then extend the analysis of interaction-driven quantum Otto engine cycles to systems where control is exerted over the strength of arbitrary quantum operators that might be present in the system Hamiltonian (such as one-body, or three-body, etc.), finding that the general principles derived for the sudden quench with two-body interactions apply universally. As an example, this is demonstrated for a conventional volumetric Otto cycle, where beneficial net work is generated by leveraging the control over the frequency of an external trap, which is a one-body operator. However, we emphasize that the results derived here apply universally to all Otto engine cycles operating under a sudden quench protocol.</p>

            <h2>Effective potential and scattering length of shielding polar molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Xu, Gang Chen</p>
            <p>We investigate the effective potential and scattering length of ultracold polar molecules under different shielding techniques. First, we derive the effective potential for two polar molecules in the presence of an elliptical polarization field, combined elliptical and linear polarization fields, and combined elliptical polarization and static fields. The effective potential is then expressed as a sum of a zero-range contact interaction and a long-range dipole-dipole interaction under the Born approximation. We find that the first two shielding methods only partially suppress attractive interactions, while the second method allows for the construction of bound states with different polarization shapes. The last shielding method can achieve complete cancellation of residual attractive forces, which is particularly significant for maintaining quantum degeneracy in ultracold dipolar systems. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the effective potential and scattering length of shielding polar molecules, which is crucial for studying many-body physics in ultracold dipolar systems.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood. Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum-observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces. Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Effects at a Spin-Flop Transition in the Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V.V. Val'kov, A.O. Zlotnikov, A. Gamov, N.A. Fedorova, F.N. Tomilin</p>
            <p>It is shown that the experimentally detected features in the low-temperature behavior of the magnetization in an external magnetic field perpendicular to the layers of manganese ions of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ are due to quantum effects induced by the off-diagonal nature of the trigonal component of the crystal field. In this case, the anomalous increase in the magnetization of the material before the spin-flop transition, as well as after it in the phase of "collapsed" sublattices, is explained by the suppression of contributions from quantum effects. The comparison of the results of the theoretical analysis with experimental data has made it possible to refine the parameters of the effective spin model of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and to establish the important role of the noted trigonal component.</p>

            <h2>Modulation of Polarization and Metallicity in Janus Sliding Ferroelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshay Mahajan, Awadhesh Narayan</p>
            <p>Sliding ferroelectricity is emerging as a distinct and promising mechanism for realizing ferroelectricity in low-dimensional systems, offering new design principles beyond the conventional ferroelectric mechanism. Further, the coexistence of the out-of-plane polarization with in-plane conductivity induced by electrostatic charge doping makes these systems strong candidates for realizing ferroelectric metals. Using density functional theory calculations, we analyze the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based Janus sliding ferroelectric bilayers XMY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, Te; X $\neq$ Y). In addition to exhibiting switchable interlayer polarization, Janus sliding ferroelectrics possess an intrinsic electric field within each monolayer, arising from the electronegativity difference between the chalcogen atoms. We discover that the intrinsic electric field of the monolayers can be used to modulate the interlayer ferroelectric polarization and the electronic band structure. We identify the decrease in the interlayer distance due to a particular stacking of the Janus bilayers as a major contributor to increasing polarization and reducing the bandgap. The direction of the intrinsic electric field within the Janus monolayers plays a significant role in the modulation of layer-wise contribution in the valence and conduction bands, which influences the polarization reduction due to extrinsic charge dopants. Extending this concept to Janus trilayers, we observe further enhancement in polarization and additional bandgap reduction compared to their bilayer counterparts. These results highlight the tunability of TMD-based Janus sliding ferroelectrics and suggest a pathway for designing low bandgap ferroelectrics and potential ferroelectric metals.</p>

            <h2>Ultrasonic spin pumping in the antiferromagnetic acoustic resonator $α-\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$</h2>

            <p>Recent advances in magnon spintronics have ignited interest in the interactions between the spin and elastic subsystems of magnetic materials. These interactions suggest a dynamic connection between collective excitations of spins, quantized as magnons, and elastic waves generated by perturbations in the crystal lattice, quantized as phonons. Both magnons and their associated magnon-phonon excitations can act as sources of spin pumping from magnetic materials into non-magnetic metals. Although a considerable body of research has focused on spin pumping via elastic waves in ferromagnets, similar investigations involving antiferromagnets have yet to be undertaken. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of generating spin currents at ultrasonic frequencies of acoustic resonance in antiferromagnetic crystal hematite $\alpha-\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ at room temperature. We provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that, due to strong magnetoelastic coupling, acoustic vibrations in hematite induce significant variable deviations in magnetization, resulting in spin accumulation at the antiferromagnet-normal metal interface, which in turn leads to the generation of spin and charge currents in the metal. Charge currents arising from the inverse spin Hall effect can be measured using the same methodology employed under high-frequency spin pumping conditions at the resonances of the magnetic subsystem itself. Moreover, the acoustic resonance in hematite is significantly more pronounced (by hundreds or even thousands of times) than in other quasiferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic systems, enabling the attainment of extremely large amplitudes of magnetic oscillations for spin pumping. This research highlights the new approach of utilizing acoustic spin pumping to manipulate spin currents in magnetic materials, particularly antiferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Magnon thermal Hall effect in insulating antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir A. Zyuzin</p>
            <p>In this paper we theoretically discuss thermal Hall effect of magnons in insulating Néel ordered antiferromagnets at zero external magnetic field. We show that non-zero thermal Hall effect requires absence of any symmetry between the two sublattices. The thermal Hall effect of magnons will be non-zero by a virtue of the spin-momentum splitting of the magnon spectrum due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as well as anisotropic second-nearest exchange interaction different in the two sublattices, both corresponding to the broken symmetry. We construct a theoretical model in which an external electric field may change the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic system thus altering the thermal Hall effect of magnons.</p>

Chica, Ding Xu, Fuyang Tay, Vinicius da Silveira Lanza Avelar, Eric A. Arsenault, James McIver, Dmitri N. Basov, Milan Delor, Xavier Roy, X.-Y. Zhu</p>
            <p>Excitation of ordered phases produces quasiparticles and collective modes, as exemplified by magnons that emerge from magnetic order, with applications in information transmission and quantum interconnects. Extending this paradigm to ferroelectric materials suggests the existence of ferrons, i.e. fundamental quanta of the collective excitation of ferroelectric order5 developed theoretically by Bauer and coworkers. While coherent magnons are observed in a broad range of experiments, coherent ferrons have eluded experimental detection. This discrepancy is particularly intriguing given that electric dipole interactions (FE) are inherently stronger than their magnetic counterparts. Here, we report the generation and transport of coherent ferrons in the van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric material NbOI2. By launching collective oscillations of the ferroelectric dipoles using a short laser pulse, we identify coherent ferrons from intense and narrow-band terahertz (THz) emission and observe their propagations along the polar direction at extremely hypersonic velocities exceeding 10^5 m/s. The THz emission is a second-order nonlinear process that requires ferroelectric order, as is confirmed in the structurally related ferroelectric WO2Br2 and non-ferroelectric TaOBr2. The discovery of coherent ferrons paves the way for numerous applications, including narrow-band THz emission, ferronic information processing, and quantum interconnects.</p>

            <h2>Phase-space approach to cavity field dynamics in a squeezed thermal reservoir</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E.P. Mattos, A. Vidiella-Barranco</p>
            <p>Quantum systems, such as a single-mode cavity field coupled to a thermal bath, typically experience destructive effects due to interactions with their noisy environment. When the bath combines both thermal fluctuations and a nonclassical feature like quadrature squeezing, forming a squeezed thermal reservoir, the system's behaviour can change substantially. In this work, we study the evolution of the cavity field in this generalized environment using an alternative phase-space approach based on the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$-function. We derive a compact analytical expression for the time-dependent $P$-function for arbitrary initial cavity field states and demonstrate its utility through specific examples. Additionally, we obtain analytical expressions, as a function of time, for some statistical properties of the cavity field, as well as for the nonclassical depth, $\tau_m$, a nonclassicality measure calculated directly from the $P$-function.</p>

While a similar analysis has been performed for the bosonic O(N) model, fermionic models pose new challenges. In this work, we systematically explore the CFT spectrum in both the large and small $q$ limits beyond the first few orders, and perform a resurgence analysis. Through this approach, we identify the exponential corrections that relate the convergent small-$q$ expansion to the asymptotic large-$q$ behavior. Our results are suggestive of a geometric interpretation of these results in terms of the worldline of particles moving along the geodesics on the cylinder.</p>

            <h2>Iterative Corpus Refinement for Materials Property Prediction Based on Scientific Texts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Zhang, Markus Stricker</p>
            <p>The discovery and optimization of materials for specific applications is hampered by the practically infinite number of possible elemental combinations and associated properties, also known as the `combinatorial explosion'. By nature of the problem, data are scarce and all possible data sources should be used. In addition to simulations and experimental results, the latent knowledge in scientific texts is not yet used to its full potential. We present an iterative framework that refines a given scientific corpus by strategic selection of the most diverse documents, training Word2Vec models, and monitoring the convergence of composition-property correlations in embedding space. Our approach is applied to predict high-performing materials for oxygen reduction (ORR), hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions for a large number of possible candidate compositions. Our method successfully predicts the highest performing compositions among a large pool of candidates, validated by experimental measurements of the electrocatalytic performance in the lab. This work demonstrates and validates the potential of iterative corpus refinement to accelerate materials discovery and optimization, offering a scalable and efficient tool for screening large compositional spaces where reliable data are scarce or non-existent.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reed A. Foster, Stephen Kandeh, Owen Medeiros, Alejandro Simon, Matteo Castellani, Karl K. Berggren</p>
            <p>Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with over $50\,\mathrm{dB}$ of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency ($200\,\mathrm{MHz}$ vs. $80\,\mathrm{MHz}$) at roughly one seventh the cost.</p>

            <h2>Global-Local Duality of Energetic Control Cost in Multipartite Quantum Correlated Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Guan, Junjie Liu, Jian-Hua Jiang</p>
            <p>Multipartite quantum correlated systems (MQCSs) are widely utilized in diverse quantum information tasks, where their sophisticated control inherently incurs energetic costs. However, the fundamental characteristics of these control costs remain elusive, largely due to the lack of thermodynamic descriptions capable of capturing the full complexities of MQCSs. Here, we uncover universal thermodynamic relations for arbitrary MQCSs weakly coupled to a thermal bath, establishing an intrinsic global-local duality of control costs. Using these relations, we elucidate the exact role of multipartite correlation--a defining quantum feature of MQCSs--in shaping control costs at finite times. We also demonstrate that the relative magnitude between global and local control costs is undetermined, which perplexes the cost management of MQCSs under finite-time controls. Our results are numerically corroborated with applications to experimentally realizable multi-qubit systems undergoing finite-time qubit reset processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangming Liu, Hsing-Ta Chen</p>
            <p>In this work, we systematically investigate the spectral and transport properties of exciton-polaritons under the explicit influence of intermolecular vibrational coupling, which introduces dynamic disorder. In the context of a one-dimensional molecular chain strongly interacting with a cavity photon, we demonstrate the polaritonic characteristics of the spectral function and its interactions with the electronic band broadened by the coupling disorder. We further dissect the current flux into its bare excitonic contribution and transport via the cavity photon. Our results reveal that the enhancement in the charge carrier mobility and frequency-resolved conductivity stems from the photon-mediated current. More importantly, contrary to the intuition that dynamic disorder hinders transport, intermolecular vibrational coupling can facilitate exciton-polariton transport, offering an additional degree of tunability for material properties.</p>

In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) of up to 100 spins and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems of up 50 spins. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ & $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</p>

            <h2>Solvated electrons in polar liquids as epsilon-near-zero materials tunable in the terahertz frequency range</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Runge, Michael Woerner, Denys I. Bondar, Thomas Elsaesser</p>
            <p>Electrons in polar liquids give rise to a polaron resonance at a terahertz (THz) frequency \nu_0 depending on electron concentration. The impact of this resonance on light propagation is studied in experiments, where a femtosecond pump pulse generates electrons via multiphoton ionization and a THz probe pulse propagated through the excited sample is detected in a phase-resolved way. We observe a behavior characteristic for epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials with strongly modified phase and group velocities around \nu_0, and a broadening of the THz pulse envelope below \nu_0. Calculations based on a local-field approach reproduce the ENZ behavior.</p>

            <p>We realize a driven-dissipative Ising spin glass using cavity QED in a novel ``4/7" multimode geometry. Gases of ultracold atoms trapped within the cavity by optical tweezers serve as effective spins. They are coupled via randomly signed, all-to-all Ising cavity-mediated interactions. Networks of up to n = 25 spins are holographically imaged via cavity emission. The system is driven through a frustrated transverse-field Ising transition, and we show that the entropy of the spin glass states depends on the rate at which the transition is crossed. Despite being intrinsically nonequilibrium, the system exhibits phenomena associated with Parisi's theory of equilibrium spin glasses, namely replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and ultrametric structure. For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunjing Gao, Xiao Wang, Ning Xi, Yunfeng Jiang, Rong Yu, Jianda Wu</p>
            <p>Emergent Ising$_h^2$ integrability is anticipated in a quantum Ising ladder composed of two weakly-coupled critical transverse field Ising chains. The system is remarkable for including eight types of massive relativistic particles, with their scattering matrix and mass spectrum characterized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ Lie algebra. In this article, by computing the spin dynamical structure factors following analytical form factor approach, we clearly identify dispersive single-particle excitations of (anti-) soliton and breathers as well as their multi-particle continua in the spectra, which is further confirmed by the numerical simulations. We show that the selection rule inherent in the parity and topological charge of the theory, causes a significant result that charge-parity-odd particles, termed as dark particles, cannot be directly excited from the ground state through any local or quasi-local operations. This in turn suggests the long lifetime of the lightest dark particle.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reetam Paul, Jonathan C. Crowhurst, Stanimir A. Bonev</p>
            <p>The use of pressure to obtain new materials that can be recovered under ambient conditions is a central problem in high-pressure physics. Despite decades of research, this goal has only been achieved in the laboratory for a few notable examples, such as diamond and cubic boron nitride. An area of significant interest is the transformation under compression of light-element molecular compounds to extended covalent-bonded (polymeric) solids. Among them, CO$_2$ has been extensively studied because of its status as a prototypical simple molecular system with a rich phase diagram and due to its fundamental role in Earth's physics and chemistry. One of its polymeric crystalline phases, accessible at extreme pressures and temperatures, has been recently quenched to ambient pressure, but below room temperature. Here we report ab initio calculations predicting that isothermal compression of a carbon monoxide and oxygen mixture (CO+O$_2$), rather than the compound CO$_2$, lowers the onset of C-polymerization at room temperature from ~118 GPa to ~7 GPa (complete by ~23 GPa). Moreover, it leads to the formation of an intrinsically different polymer with enhanced metastability. We predict that this dense phase is an energetic material which can potentially be recovered to ambient pressure and temperature.</p>

            <h2>Multi higher-order Dirac and nodal line semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Arnob Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in exploring higher-order topology and their semi-metallic counterparts, particularly in the context of Dirac, Weyl, and nodal line semimetals, termed as higher-order Dirac semimetal (HODSM), higher-order Weyl semimetal, and higher-order nodal line semimetal (HONLSM). The HODSM phase exhibits hinge Fermi arcs (FAs) with a quantized higher-order topological invariant. Conversely, the HONLSM phase is a hybrid-order topological phase manifesting both drumhead-like surface states and hinge FAs as a signature of first- and second-order topology, and also possesses both first- and second-order topological invariants. In this work, we investigate a tight binding model for multi-HODSM (mHODSM) hosting multiple hinge FAs having a quantized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) greater than one. Furthermore, we obtain a multi-HONLSM (mHONLSM) phase from the mHODSM by applying an external magnetic field, which breaks the $PT$-symmetry. The mHONLSM phase possesses both the dipolar winding number, non-vanishing only inside the nodal loops, being the representative invariant for first-order topology, and the QWN, featuring both drumhead-like surface states and multiple hinge FAs. We study the spectral properties of the mHODSM and mHONLSM in different geometries. We also investigate the hinge FA-mediated transport in HONLSM employing a two-terminal setup.</p>

            <p>In a system of two-dimensional electrons, a combination of broken symmetry, interactions, and nontrivial topology can conspire to give rise to a nonlinear transport regime, where electric current density scales as the square of electric field. This regime has become a venue for exciting discoveries such as the nonlinear Hall effect and diode-like nonreciprocal transport. However, interpretation of experimental data is challenging in the nonlinear regime as DC transport is described by a rank-3 conductivity tensor with 6 free parameters. Here, we resolve this challenge by analytically solving for the nonlinear potential distribution across the disk sample for an arbitrary linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors. This allows us to unambiguously extract all components of the nonlinear tensor from experimental measurement. Using this novel tool, we identify giant nonlinear Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene. Our methodology provides the first systematic framework for interpreting nonlinear transport and uncovers a new route towards understanding quasi-2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhan Wang, Heng-Jia Zhang, Kun Jiang, Fu-Chun Zhang</p>
            <p>The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit formed by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction $U$ and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped due to electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to be a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The effects of Hund's coupling $J_H$ on the low-energy spectra are also studied via exact diagonalization. The proposed low-energy theory for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is found to be valid in a wide range of $U$ and $J_H$.</p>

            <p>We study the thermoelectrical transport transverse to conventional and topological Josephson junctions with a central quantum dot (QD). For that purpose, we derive an effective resonant tunneling model where the QD is renormalized with an induced superconducting gap. By applying the Keldysh Green's function technique, we compute the local density of states as well as the transmission functions. In the latter case, we observe that the Andreev bound states forming on the QD are inverted if the junction has $p$-wave symmetry, meaning that electron and hole orbitals switch roles. We calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients both analytically and numerically and show how the induced gaps and the band inversion are reflected in the electrical and heat conductance as well as the Seebeck coefficient, the latter experiencing a sign change in the topological case.</p>

            <p>We investigate the electromagnetic wave absorption process in a coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate model in different dimensionality at zero temperature. As the analogue of phonon in the solid state physics, the elementary excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate is described by Bogoliubov quasiparticle or bogolon for short. Due to the small magnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the absorption process is prohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this depression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the simple Bose gas model. In this article, we develop a microscopical theory for electromagnetic wave absorption by a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the absorption rate dependence in different dimensions. Our calculation shows the possibility of manipulating the absorption property by tuning the parameters of the condensates.</p>

            <p>A photonic heat amplifier (PHA) designed for cryogenic operations is introduced and analyzed. This device comprises two variable-range-hopping reservoirs connected by lossless lines, which allow them to exchange heat through photonic modes. This configuration enables negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC), which can be harnessed to amplify thermal signals. To achieve this, one reservoir is maintained at a high temperature, serving as the source terminal of a thermal transistor. Concurrently, in the other one, we establish tunnel contacts to metallic reservoirs, which function as the gate and drain terminals. With this arrangement, it is possible to control the heat flux exchange between the source and drain by adjusting the gate temperature. We present two different parameter choices that yield different performances: the first emphasizes modulating the source-drain heat current, while the second focuses on the modulation of the colder temperature variable range hopping reservoir. Lastly, we present a potential design variation in which all electronic reservoirs are thermally connected through only photonic modes, allowing interactions between distant elements. The proposal of the PHA addresses the lack of thermal transistors and amplifiers in the mK range while being compatible with the rich toolbox of circuit quantum electrodynamics. It can be adapted to various applications, including sensing and developing thermal circuits and control devices at sub-Kelvin temperatures, which are relevant to quantum technologies.</p>

These probes carry an evanescent electromagnetic field that can drive localized excitations and provide high-resolution information on material structures and their optical responses, currently reaching the sub-ångström and few-meV regime. Moreover, combining free electrons with pulsed light sources in ultrafast electron microscopy adds temporal resolution in the sub-femtosecond range while offering enhanced control of the electron wave function. Beyond their exceptional capabilities for time-resolved spectromicroscopy, free electrons are emerging as powerful tools in quantum nanophotonics, on par with photons in their ability to carry and transfer quantum information, create entanglement within and with a specimen, and reveal previously inaccessible details on nanoscale quantum phenomena.

            <p>Fracture toughness ($K_\mathrm{Ic}$) and fracture strength ($\sigma_\mathrm{f}$) are key criteria in the selection and design of reliable ceramics. However, their experimental characterization remains challenging -- especially for ceramic thin films, where size and interfacial effects hinder accurate and reproducible measurements. Here, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained on \textit{ab initio} datasets of single crystal models deformed up to fracture are used to characterize transgranular cleavage in pre-cracked ceramic diboride TMB$_2$ (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf) lattices through stress intensity factor ($K$)-controlled loading. Mode-I simulations performed across distinct crack geometries show that fracture is primarily driven by straight crack extension along the original plane. The corresponding macroscale fracture-initiation properties ($K_\mathrm{Ic} \approx 1.7$-2.9 MPa$\cdot\sqrt{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_\mathrm{f} \approx 1.6$-2.4 GPa) are extrapolated using established scaling laws. Considering TiB$_2$ as a representative system, additional simulations explore loading conditions ranging from pure Mode-I (opening) to Mode-II (sliding). TiB$_2$ models containing prismatic cracks exhibit their lowest fracture resistance under mixed-mode conditions, where the crack deflects onto pyramidal planes--as confirmed by nanoindentation tests on TiB$_2$(0001) thin films. This study establishes $K$-controlled, MLIP-based simulations as predictive tools for orientation- and mode-dependent fracture in ceramics. The approach is readily extendable to finite temperatures for evaluating fracture behavior under conditions relevant to refractory applications.</p>

            <p>Graphene functionalized with catalytic transition metals offers high-performance gas sensing by coupling graphene's exceptional electronic transport properties with the metal's catalytic activity, yet the atomistic relationships connecting synthesis parameters, morphological outcomes, and sensor performance remain elusive. We developed an equivariant machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) with near-DFT accuracy to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Pt crystal growth on graphene and subsequent H$_2$-sensing. MD simulations validated by TEM show that Pt deposition begins with dispersed nuclei coalescing into polycrystalline nanoclusters with predominantly FCC interiors, while both MD and Raman spectroscopy reveal a predominantly non-covalent Pt-graphene interaction that induces moderate local strain and charge transfer yet preserves graphene's structural integrity. Reactive MD simulations confirm H$_2$ dissociative chemisorption exclusively on Pt, with negligible spillover onto pristine graphene. However, H adsorption on Pt attenuates the Pt-graphene interfacial binding, providing an indirect electronic pathway for H$_2$ sensing. Transient and steady-state kinetic analyses demonstrate that an intermediate Pt loading minimizes the limit of detection; lower loadings facilitate faster response and recovery kinetics and enhance signal transduction, whereas higher loadings increase the doping level of graphene. DFT charge analysis indicates that under-coordinated Pt clusters induce $n$-type doping in graphene, whereas continuous Pt films induce $p$-type doping, with both effects attenuated upon H adsorption. The developed machine-learned MD framework enables quantum-mechanically accurate modeling of metal crystal growth on graphene, elucidates the underlying H$_2$-sensing mechanism, and correlates several key sensing figures of merit with metal loading and morphology.</p>

            <p>Tetravacancies in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with consistent edge termination (boron or nitrogen) form triangular nanopores with electrostatic potentials that can be leveraged for applications such as selective ion transport and neuromorphic computing. In order to quantitatively predict the properties of these structures, an atomic-level understanding of their local electronic and chemical environments is required. Moreover, robust methods for their precision manufacture are needed. Here were use electron irradiation in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) at high dose rate to drive the formation of boron-terminated tetravacancies in monolayer hBN. Characterization of the defects is achieved using aberration-corrected STEM, monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and electron ptychography. Z-contrast in STEM and chemical fingerprinting by core-loss EELS enable identification of the edge terminations, while electron ptychography gives insight into structural relaxation of the tetravacancies and provides evidence of enhanced electron density around the defect perimeters indicative of bonding effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Henkel</p>
            <p>A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in classical many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</p>

            <p>We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</p>

            <h2>Low-temperature spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix of the XXZ chain in the massless regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saskia Faulmann, Frank Göhmann, Karol K. Kozlowski</p>
            <p>The free energy per lattice site of a quantum spin chain in the thermodynamic limit is determined by a single `dominant' Eigenvalue of an associated quantum transfer matrix in the infinite Trotter number limit. For integrable quantum spin chains, related with solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, an appropriate choice of the quantum transfer matrix enables to study its spectrum, e.g.\ by means of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. In its turn, the knowledge of the full spectrum allows one to study its universality properties such as the appearance of a conformal spectrum in the low-temperature regime. More generally, accessing the full spectrum is a necessary step for deriving thermal form factor series representations of the correlation functions of local operators for the spin chain under consideration. These are statements that have been established by physicists on a heuristic level and that are calling for a rigorous mathematical justification. In this work we implement certain aspects of this programme with the example of the XXZ quantum spin chain in the antiferromagnetic massless regime and in the low-temperature limit. We rigorously establish the existence, uniqueness and characterise the form of the solutions to the non-linear integral equations that are equivalent to the Bethe Ansatz equations for the quantum transfer matrix of this model. This allows us to describe that part of the quantum transfer matrix spectrum that is related to the Bethe Ansatz and that does not collapse to zero in the infinite Trotter number limit. Within the considered part of the spectrum we rigorously identify the dominant Eigenvalue and show that those correlations lengths that diverge in the low-temperature limit are given, to the leading order, by the spectrum of the free Boson $c=1$ conformal field theory. This rigorously establishes a long-standing conjecture present in the physics literature.</p>

            <p>In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D.

            <h2>ReGNet: Reciprocal Space-Aware Long-Range Modeling for Crystalline Property Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianan Nie, Peiyao Xiao, Kaiyi Ji, Peng Gao</p>
            <p>Predicting properties of crystals from their structures is a fundamental yet challenging task in materials science. Unlike molecules, crystal structures exhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of capturing both local and global information effectively. However, most current works fall short of capturing long-range interactions within periodic structures. To address this limitation, we leverage \emph{reciprocal space} to efficiently encode long-range interactions with learnable filters within Fourier transforms. We introduce Reciprocal Geometry Network (ReGNet), a novel architecture that integrates geometric GNNs and reciprocal blocks to model short-range and long-range interactions, respectively. Experimental results on JARVIS, Materials Project, and MatBench demonstrate that ReGNet achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across a range of crystal property prediction tasks. Additionally, we explore a model extension that employs the mixture-of-experts for multi-property prediction with promising results and high computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of our model as a scalable and accurate solution for crystal property prediction. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations without quantum corrections: A coherent-incoherent correspondence approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Nishiyama, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>We introduce the coherent-incoherent correspondence as a framework for deriving quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations under continuous measurement in Lindblad dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence establishes a mapping between the original quantum system undergoing coherent evolution and its corresponding incoherent system without coherent dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence relates quantities across these two systems, including jump statistics, dynamical activity, and entropy production. Since the classical-like properties of the incoherent system allow us to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations within it, these relations can be transferred to the coherent system via the coherent-incoherent correspondence. This enables us to derive quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the original coherent system. Unlike existing quantum uncertainty relations, which typically require explicit quantum correction terms, our approach avoids these additional terms. This framework provides a general method for deriving trade-offs in quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Exact solution and Luttinger liquid behavior of the quantum 1D hard rod model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengjie Yu, Zhaoxuan Zhu, Laurent Sanchez-Palencia</p>
            <p>The quantum hard rod model, a one-dimensional extension of the Lieb-Liniger model, is exactly solved using an adapted Bethe ansatz. Our solution, benchmarked against path-integral quantum Monte Carlo calculations, reveals significant corrections to the excitation spectrum and thermodynamic properties, previously overlooked by the standard excluded-volume approach. We also show that the hard rod model exhibits Luttinger liquid behavior across a wide range of parameters, at zero and finite temperature, as unveiled by correlation functions. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding strongly correlated regimes in dilute 1D systems, with applications to quantum wires, spin chains, and ultracold atoms.</p>

            <p>We investigated the origin of collective electronic phase transitions induced at the heterointerface between monoclinic insulating (MI) VO2 and rutile metallic (RM) electron-doped VO2 layers using in situ soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPES) on nanoscale VO2/V0.99W0.01O2 (001)R bilayers. Thanks to the surface sensitivity of SXPES, we determined the changes in the electronic structure and V-V dimerization in each constituent layer separately. The selective observation of the electronic and crystal structures in the upper VO2 layer of the bilayer indicates that the MI-phase VO2 layer undergoes a transition to the RM phase by forming the heterointerface. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the RM-phase VO2 undergoes a transition to the MI phase with a decrease in temperature, as in the case of a VO2 single-layer film. Furthermore, during the temperature-induced phase transition in the VO2 layer, the spectra are well described by an in-plane phase separation of the RM and MI phases. These results suggest that the interface-induced transition from the MI phase to the RM phase in the VO2 layer of bilayers occurs as a collective phase transition derived from the static energy balance between the interfacial energy and the bulk free energies of the constituent layers.</p>

            <h2>Parasitic RF-SQUIDs in superconducting qubits due to wirebonds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Berlitz, E. Daum, S. Deck, A.V. Ustinov, J. Lisenfeld</p>
            <p>Superconducting qubits show great promise to realize practical quantum computers from micro-fabricated integrated circuits. However, their solid-state architecture bears the burden of parasitic modes in qubit materials and the control circuitry which cause decoherence and interfere with qubits. Here, we present evidence that wirebonds, which are used to contact the micro-circuits and to realize chip-to-chip airbridges, may contain parasitic Josephson junctions. In our experiment, such a junction was enclosed in a superconducting loop and so gave rise to the formation an RF-SQUID which interfered with a nearby flux-tunable transmon qubit. Periodic signatures observed in magnetic field sweeps revealed a strong AC-dispersive coupling of the parasitic RF-SQUID to both the qubit and its readout resonator, in addition to the DC-inductive coupling between RF-SQUID and qubit. Our finding sheds light on a previously unknown origin of decoherence due to parasitic Josephson junctions in superconducing circuits.</p>

            <h2>Atomic-scale ultrafast dynamics of local charge order in a THz-induced metastable state of 1T-TaS2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis E. Parra López, Alkisti Vaitsi, Vivien Sleziona, Fabian Schulz, Martin Wolf, Melanie Müller</p>
            <p>Light-induced control of quantum materials enables manipulation of electronic and structural phases on ultrafast timescales. Probing their atomic-scale dynamics is essential to understand the role of defects and domain boundaries, but conventional time-resolved techniques lack the required spatial resolution. Here, we use terahertz (THz) scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate a THz-light-induced metastable state near a defect in 1T-TaS2, and follow its photoinduced dynamics in real space and time. THz excitation induces quasi-stationary changes in the insulating gap on angstrom scales, which we associate with interlayer stacking changes. Simultaneously, THz-lightwave-driven tunneling provides access to ultrafast dynamics of the metastable state, revealing 2.5 THz oscillations of the charge density wave amplitude mode and a 1.3 THz mode attributed to an interlayer shear vibration emerging near the defect. Our results demonstrate the dual role of tip-enhanced THz fields in driving metastability and ultrafast tunneling, opening new avenues for ultrafast atomic-scale control of quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Phase Doubling and Entanglement in Coherent Many-Body Chemical Reactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shu Nagata, Tadej Meznarsic, Chuixin Kong, Cheng Chin</p>
            <p>In the quantum degenerate regime, atoms and molecules can occupy a single quantum state, forming coherent matter waves. Here reactions are described by nonlinear mixing of the matter waves, giving rise to quantum many-body chemistry, where spatial coherence is preserved between the reactants and products. While the phase matching of matter waves during the reaction process has been theoretically predicted, experimental confirmation has remained elusive. Here we report on the observation of matter wave phase doubling when bosonic atoms pair into molecules. Using matter wave diffraction, we verify spatial phase coherence and observe a two-fold increase of phase in the molecular wavefunction, confirming the matter-wave version of phase doubling. The diffraction patterns also reveal non-classical correlations indicative of entangled atom pairs formed during the reaction. Our results establish molecular matter-wave diffraction as a powerful tool to probe quantum coherence and entanglement generation in chemically reactive quantum gases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun-Rok Jeon, Jae-Keun Kim, Jiho Yoon, Jae-Chun Jeon, Hyeon Han, Audrey Cottet, Takis Kontos, Stuart S. P. Parkin</p>
            <p>The recent realization of zero-field polarity-reversible supercurrent rectification in proximity-magnetized Rashba(-type) Pt Josephson junctions (JJs)5 promises its practical applications for superconducting logic circuits and cryogenic memories. Here, by substituting the Pt Josephson barrier for either 5d or 4d element proximity layer with different (para-)magnetic susceptibility, spin-orbit coupling and electronic band structure, we identify the proximity role of the Josephson barrier in determining the zero-field diode properties. Ta (W) JJs reveal the zero-field diode efficiency of ~17 (~5)% at 2 K, slightly (much) smaller than that of the Pt JJs. Notably, the zero-field diode polarity of Ta and W JJs turns out to be opposite to the Pt JJs. Our results, along with a large zero-field diode efficiency found in highly magnetic-susceptible Pd JJs and a non-volatile anomalous phase-shift {\phi}_0 probed by superconducting quantum interferometry, demonstrate the {\phi}_0-tuning of zero-field diode performance via proximity engineering of interface magnetic ordering and Rashba effect.</p>

            <h2>Majorana Zero Mode Induced by a Screw Dislocation on the Surface of an Iron-based Superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naoki Otsuki, Yositake Takane</p>
            <p>We propose a simple scenario to describe a dislocation-induced Majorana zero mode on the surface of an iron-based superconductor, using an illustrative model with a cylindrical hole of radius $R$ perpendicular to its top surface. Topological surface states on the inner surface of the hole form an effective chiral $p$-wave superconductor. When the top surface has a perpendicular magnetization, chiral Majorana modes appear near the circular edge of the hole. Since the corresponding wavefunctions obey an antiperiodic boundary condition in the circumferential direction, a Majorana zero mode at zero energy does not appear. However, if a screw dislocation is inserted through the hole, the antiperiodic boundary condition is transformed into a periodic one, resulting in the appearance of a Majorana zero mode. This Majorana zero mode remains in the no-hole limit of $R \to 0$. We confirm this scenario by numerical simulation and effective theory. A method of creating a Majorana zero mode in the absence of the surface magnetization is briefly described.</p>

            <p>Strong electron-hole interactions in a semimetal or narrow-gap semiconductor may drive a ground state of condensed excitons. Monolayer WTe2 has been proposed as a host material for such an exciton condensate, but the order parameter - the key signature of a macroscopic quantum-coherent condensate - has not been observed. Here we use Fourier-transform scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (FT-STS) to study quasi-particle interference (QPI) and periodic modulations of the local density of states (LDOS) in monolayer WTe2. In WTe2 on graphene, in which the carrier density can be varied via back-gating, FT-STS shows QPI features in the 2D bulk bands, confirming the interacting nature of the bandgap in neutral WTe2 and the semi-metallic nature of highly n- and p-doped WTe2. We observe additional non-dispersive spatial modulations in the LDOS imprinted on the topological edge mode of neutral WTe2 on metallic substrates (graphene and graphite), which we interpret as the interaction of the topological edge mode with the expected charge density wave order parameter of the excitonic condensate in WTe2 at low interaction strength due to screening by the metallic substrates.</p>

            <p>Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.</p>

Due to the Hubbard interaction, the quantum-geometric multipole fluctuations condense into the multipole order. We predict complex magnetic correlations, which are a signature of quantum-geometric multipole magnetism, and propose experimental verification.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal and long-range three-body interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates induced by optical feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Qing Zhang, Liang-Jun He, Han Pu, Zheng-Wei Zhou, Yong-Chang Zhang</p>
            <p>We propose generating long-range and nonreciprocal three-body interactions in quantum gases via optical feedback. By placing a quasi-two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in front of two reflecting mirrors and illuminating it with dichromatic laser beams, these driving optical fields traverse the BEC twice, thereby inducing a feedback effect on the atoms. We demonstrate that this optical feedback gives rise to an effective three-body atom-atom interaction with remarkable long-range and nonreciprocal properties. Due to its long-range nature, this three-body interaction can cause unique spatial symmetry-breaking behaviors in the BEC, resulting in various stable stationary states as well as unexpected diffusive collapse. Notably, a distinct ring state emerges through a purely self-organizing process. Furthermore, by analyzing the real-time dynamics of the BEC, we show that the nonreciprocal nature of this interaction can lead to intriguing self-acceleration of the condensate, seemingly violating Newton's law of motion. Additionally, our scheme offers a highly controllable setting, where pairwise two-body interactions can be tuned to vanish. This flexibility provides a promising route for exploring exotic physics associated with multi-body interactions.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous supercurrents in the presence of particle losses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Risa Ogino, Shun Uchino</p>
            <p>We show that supercurrent properties in a superfluid or superconducting junction are significantly modified due to single-particle losses present in a conduction channel. In the presence of a spin-independent particle loss, we find regimes where the Josephson current $I_N(\phi)$ takes zero at a position in between $\phi= 0$ and $\phi=\pi$, and the direction of the supercurrent is reversed. Although the region is narrow, we also find a regime in which the critical current is enhanced by dissipation. Such anomalous behaviors in the Josephson current are attributed to a subtle interplay between the contribution that is present regardless of dissipation and the unconventional one that is absent without dissipation. In the presence of a spin-selective particle loss, it is shown that a dissipation-induced spin supercurrent and its reversal occur. The proposed system is analyzed by means of the Keldysh field theory approach based on the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudershan-Lindblad master equation and may be realized in ultracold atomic gases and solid-state systems.</p>

Although this prediction has been confirmed experimentally, the model by itself suffers from a serious conceptual problem: The low - lying excitation spectrum manifests a purely imaginary phonon velocity, $c_d^2 < 0$. In present work we develop self consistent theory of two component Bose system with attractive inter species interaction, which accurately takes into account pair correlations in terms of anomalous and mixed densities. We have shown that this procedure is able to resolve the problem of $c_d^2 < 0$. Limiting ourselves with a symmetric Bose mixture at zero temperature, we have found a region of stability in which a droplet may survive.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently been shown to host native defects exhibiting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with applications in nanoscale magnetic sensing and imaging. To advance these applications, deposition methods to create wafer-scale hBN films with controlled thicknesses are desirable, but a systematic study of the ODMR properties of the resultant films is lacking. Here we perform ODMR measurements of thin films (3-2000nm thick) grown via three different methods: metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We find that they all exhibit an ODMR response, including the thinnest 3nm film, albeit with different characteristics. The best volume-normalised magnetic sensitivity obtained is 30uT/sqrt(Hz um^3). We study the effect of growth temperature on a series of MOCVD samples grown under otherwise fixed conditions and find 800-900C to be an optimum range for magnetic sensitivity, with a significant improvement (up to two orders of magnitude) from post-growth annealing. This work provides a useful baseline for the magnetic sensitivity of hBN thin films deposited via standard methods and informs the feasibility of future sensing applications.</p>

            <p>alpha-Sn has recently been attracting significant interest due to its unique electronic properties. However, this allotrope of Sn is stable only below 13 °C and alternative options to the conventional stabilization by epitaxial growth on InSb are still a challenge. In this work, nanoparticles with inner alpha-Sn nanocrystals were synthesized on a Silicon substrate via a CMOS-compatible process through microwave irradiation. The nanoparticle morphology was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy, demonstrating the ability to control the nanoparticle size by a dewetting process combined with a coalescence process induced by the microwaves. Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction analyses confirmed the stabilization of the alpha-Sn phase within a SnO2 shell, while X-Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy measurements revealed the presence of a bandgap. Infrared transmission spectroscopy combined with a Tauc-plot extrapolation led to an estimate of the gap in the range from 64 to 137 meV range. Furthermore, the possibility to tune the bandgap by controlling the nanoparticle size, possibly leveraging weak quantum confinement effects, was demonstrated, unveiling the potential of alpha-Sn nanoparticles on Si for the development of CMOS-compatible THz devices.</p>

            <p>Tracer diffusion in single-file systems, where particles are restricted to move on a line without passing each other, has been a fertile ground to investigate anomalous diffusion and strong memory effects. While the long-time behavior of such a tracer has been well studied, with a known subdiffusive dynamics and a Gaussian description for the rescaled position, the finer details of multi-time correlations remain poorly understood. This work focuses on the limit where almost all sites of a Symmetric Exclusion Process (SEP), a paradigmatic lattice model, are occupied. It extends beyond Gaussian descriptions and single-time statistics to address the multi-time correlation functions of the tracer in the SEP. In this dense limit, we present a general relation between all $n$-time correlations of the non-Markovian tracer position process and the conditional probabilities of a single Markovian random walker. Using this relation, we derive explicit expressions for the four-time correlations and further explore important extensions: multiple tracers, non-equilibrium situations, and finite observation times. Our results underscore significant memory effects, strong temporal correlations, and the influence of initial conditions on long-time dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Pair binding and Hund's rule breaking in high-symmetry fullerenes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Rausch, C. Karrasch</p>
            <p>Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using massive, large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results support an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding.</p>

            <p>We investigate linear and nonlinear transverse planar transport phenomena (viz. linear and nonlinear Hall and Nernst coefficients) induced by chiral anomaly in three-dimensional spin-orbit coupled metallic systems. Unlike Weyl semimetals, these systems do not possess multiple Weyl nodes located at isolated points in the momentum space but instead host a pair of Fermi surfaces characterized by opposite Berry curvature fluxes enclosing the same band-degeneracy point. Using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the relaxation time approximation, we derive first- and second-order transverse planar transport coefficients induced by electrical and thermal gradients in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals distinctive angular dependencies of the transport coefficients, along with characteristic scaling behavior with the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomaly-induced transport coefficients exhibit an exponential temperature dependence. This unconventional behavior leads to the violations of the Mott relation at comparatively low temperatures, highlighting unique thermoelectric signatures that can be probed experimentally in 3D spin-orbit coupled metallic systems.</p>

However, X-ray irradiation experiments did not demonstrate significant singlet oxygen production compared to the controls. Although the nanocomposite design shows potential, further optimization is needed to achieve an effective X-PDT performance.</p>

            <p>Scattering experiments are at the heart of high-energy physics (HEP), breaking matter down to its fundamental constituents, probing its formation, and providing deep insight into the inner workings of nature. In the current huge drive to forge quantum computers into complementary venues that are ideally suited to capture snapshots of far-from-equilibrium HEP dynamics, a major goal is to utilize these devices for scattering experiments. A major obstacle in this endeavor has been the hardware overhead required to access the late-time post-collision dynamics while implementing the underlying gauge symmetry. Here, we report on the first quantum simulation of scattering in a lattice gauge theory (LGT), performed on \texttt{IBM}'s \texttt{ibm\_marrakesh} quantum computer. Specifically, we quantum-simulate the collision dynamics of electrons and positrons as well as mesons in a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ LGT representing $1+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED), uncovering rich post-collision dynamics that we can precisely tune with a topological $\Theta$-term and the fermionic mass. By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring. Our work provides a major step forward in the utility of quantum computers for investigating the real-time quantum dynamics of HEP collisions.</p>

            <h2>Ginsparg-Wilson Hamiltonians with Improved Chiral Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hersh Singh</p>
            <p>We construct a family of Ginsparg-Wilson Hamiltonians with improved chiral properties, starting from a construction of Creutz-Horvath-Neuberger that provides a doubler-free Hamiltonian lattice regularization for Dirac fermions in even spacetime dimensions. We use a higher-order generalization of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation due to Fujikawa, which yields an order-$k$ Hamiltonian overlap operator for each integer $k \geq 0$, with an exactly conserved but nonquantized chiral charge that becomes quantized as $k \to \infty$. Our construction provides physical insight into how Fujikawa's higher-order Ginsparg-Wilson relation improves chiral symmetry while reproducing the anomaly, highlighting the trade-offs inherent in any Hamiltonian lattice realization of an anomalous chiral symmetry. This class of Hamiltonian lattice regularizations, with their tunable chiral symmetry properties, offers potential advantages for quantum and tensor-network simulations.</p>

            <h2>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maarten Golterman, Yigal Shamir</p>
            <p>Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Giataganas</p>
            <p>The integration of high-energy degrees of freedom along the renormalization group (RG) flow in Poincaré-invariant theories can be captured by a monotonic c-function. For such theories, holographic monotonic c-functions have been constructed using entanglement entropy. However, in theories with broken Lorentz invariance, such constructions generally fail, reflecting both the violation of the entanglement RG monotonicity and its limitations in capturing certain properties of non-relativistic RG flows. Since many quantum many-body systems lack Lorentz invariance, it is of significant importance to identify a quantity that reflects the decrease in degrees of freedom along non-relativistic RG flows. We show that the recently introduced holographic timelike entanglement entropy naturally gives rise to a new c-function applicable to all such theories. We further demonstrate the existence of this c-function in theories with Lifshitz and hyperscaling-violating fixed points, showing that, provided the null energy conditions and thermodynamic stability are satisfied, the proposed c-function exhibits the expected monotonic behavior along the RG flow.</p>

            <h2>Direct Measurement of Zak Phase and Higher Winding Numbers in an Electroacoustic Cavity System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guang-Chen He, Zhao-Xian Chen, Xiao-Meng Zhang, Ze-Guo Chen, Ming-Hui Lu</p>
            <p>Topological phases are states of matter defined by global topological invariants that remain invariant under adiabatic parameter variations, provided no topological phase transition occurs. This endows them with intrinsic robustness against local perturbations. Experimentally, these phases are often identified indirectly by observing robust boundary states, protected by the bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we propose an experimental method for the direct measurement of topological invariants via adiabatic state evolution in electroacoustic coupled resonators, where time-dependent cavity modes effectively emulate the bulk wavefunction of a periodic system. Under varying external driving fields, specially prepared initial states evolve along distinct parameter-space paths. By tracking the relative phase differences among states along these trajectories, we successfully observe the quantized Zak phase in both the conventional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and its extension incorporating with next-nearest-neighbor coupling. This approach provides compelling experimental evidence for the precise identification of topological invariants and can be extended to more complex topological systems.</p>

            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the incidence of post-infection cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, in individuals over 40. While the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, this study employs a hybrid machine learning approach to analyze epidemiological data in assessing 13 key heart attack risk factors and their susceptibility. Based on a unique dataset that combines demographic, biochemical, ECG, and thallium stress-tests, this study categorizes distinct subpopulations against varying risk profiles and then divides the population into 'at-risk' (AR) and 'not-at-risk' (NAR) groups using clustering algorithms. The study reveals strong association between the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack on the 13 risk factors studied. The aggravated risk for postmenopausal patients indicates compromised individual risk factors due to estrogen depletion that may be, further compromised by extraneous stress impacts, like anxiety and fear, aspects that have traditionally eluded data modeling predictions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng Zhao, Ya-Long Ren, Xin-Lei Hei, Xue-Feng Pan, Peng-Bo Li</p>
            <p>Magnon blockade is a physical mechanism for the preparation of a single-magnon source, which has important applications in quantum information processing. Here we propose a scheme for generating an optimal magnon blockade in the spin-magnon quantum system. By introducing frequency detuning between the magnon and the spin qubit of the NV center, the conventional magnon blockade and the unconventional magnon blockade can be obtained under both strong and weak coupling, relaxing the requirements for coupling strength. Moreover, the conventional and unconventional magnon blockade can occur simultaneously when both the magnon and the spin qubit are driven. This allows the equal-time second-order correlation function to reach $10^{-8}$, about five orders of magnitude lower than that in previous works. Additionally, the time-delayed second-order correlation function avoids oscillation. Our study demonstrates the impact of frequency detuning on the magnon blockade and proposes methods to enhance the magnon blockade and relax the requirements for coupling strength through frequency detuning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher R. Kitching, Lucía S. Ramirez, Maxi San Miguel, Tobias Galla</p>
            <p>We study how zealotry and nonlinear social impact affect consensus formation in the nonlinear voter model, evolutionary games, and the partisan voter model. In all three models, consensus is an absorbing state in finite populations, while co-existence is a possible outcome of the deterministic dynamics. We show that sufficiently strong zealotry -- i.e., the presence of agents who never change state -- can drive infinite populations to consensus in all three models. However, while evolutionary games and the partisan voter model permit zealotry-induced consensus for all values of their model parameters, the nonlinear voter model does not. Central to this difference is the shape of the social impact function, which quantifies how the influence of a group scales with size, and is therefore a measure of majority and minority effects. We derive general conditions relating the slope of this function at small group sizes to the local stability of consensus. Sublinear impact favours minorities and can override zealotry to prevent consensus, whereas superlinear impact promotes majorities and therefore facilitates consensus. We extend the analysis to finite populations, exploring the time-to-consensus, and the shape of quasi-stationary distributions.</p>

            <p>Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime offer a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, particularly owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated, and high-fidelity interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of 27~$\mathrm{\mu}$K and read out in a single-shot with 77% fidelity. During the membrane's 6~ms lifetime, the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the membrane's position noise-spectrum, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at 10~mK and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Diósi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</p>

            <p>Anatase TiO2 (a-TiO2) exhibits a strong X-ray absorption linear dichroism with the X-ray incidence angle in the pre-edge, the XANES and the EXAFS at the titanium K-edge. In the pre-edge region the behaviour of the A1-A3 and B peaks, originating from the 1s-3d transitions, is due to the strong $p$-orbital polarization and strong $p-d$ orbital mixing. An unambiguous assignment of the pre-edge peak transitions is made in the monoelectronic approximation with the support of ab initio finite difference method calculations and spherical tensor analysis in quantitative agreement with the experiment. It is found that A1 is mostly an on-site 3d-4p hybridized transition, while peaks A3 and B are non-local transitions, with A3 being mostly dipolar and influence by the 3d-4p intersite hybridization, while B is due to interactions at longer range. Finally, peak A2 which was previously assigned to a transition involving pentacoordinated titanium atoms exhibits a quadrupolar angular evolution with incidence angle. These results pave the way to the use of the pre-edge peaks at the K-edge of a-TiO2 to characterize the electronic structure of related materials and in the field of ultrafast XAS where the linear dichroism can be used to compare the photophysics along different axes.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that discontinuous shear thickening (DST) can occur even in moderately dense, inertial suspensions of hydrodynamically interacting, frictionless soft particles. Using the Lubrication-Friction Discrete Element Method, our simulations reveal that DST can emerge at lower particle densities, provided that both the inertia of the suspended particles and their softness are sufficiently pronounced. Furthermore, we show that, under these conditions, the DST behavior obtained from the simulation qualitatively agrees with that predicted by kinetic theory, even without accounting for hydrodynamic interactions. These findings expand the understanding of DST in soft particle systems and highlight the importance of particle inertia and softness in controlling rheological behavior.</p>

            <h2>The grammar of the Ising model: A new complexity hierarchy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Reinhart, Gemma De les Coves</p>
            <p>How complex is an Ising model? Usually, this is measured by the computational complexity of its ground state energy problem. Yet, this complexity measure only distinguishes between planar and non-planar interaction graphs, and thus fails to capture properties such as the average node degree, the number of long range interactions, or the dimensionality of the lattice. Herein, we introduce a new complexity measure for Ising models and thoroughly classify Ising models with respect to it. Specifically, given an Ising model we consider the decision problem corresponding to the function graph of its Hamiltonian, and classify this problem in the Chomsky hierarchy. We prove that the language of this decision problem is (i) regular if and only if the Ising model is finite, (ii) constructive context free if and only if the Ising model is linear and its edge language is regular, (iii) constructive context sensitive if and only if the edge language of the Ising model is context sensitive, and (iv) decidable if and only if the edge language of the Ising model is decidable. We apply this theorem to show that the 1d Ising model, the Ising model on generalised ladder graphs, and the Ising model on layerwise complete graphs are constructive context free, while the 2d Ising model, the all-to-all Ising model, and the Ising model on perfect binary trees are constructive context sensitive. This work is a first step in the characterisation of physical interactions in terms of grammars.</p>

            <p>Ionic conduction in solids that exceeds 1 mS/cm is predicted to involve collective phonon-ion interactions in the crystal lattice. Here, we use theory and experiment to measure the possible contribution of collective phonon-ion modes to Li+ migration in Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO). The ab initio calculations predict that the targeted excitation of individual TiO6 rocking modes can lead to a three order of magnitude increase in the Li+ jump rate as compared to the excitation of single vibrational modes in the lattice associated with heating. Experimentally, coherently driving the TiO6 rocking via terahertz (THz) illumination leads to a ten-fold decrease in the normalized impedance compared to the excitation of acoustic and optical phonons that are associated with heating. These findings provide new insights into phonon-coupled ion migration mechanisms and material design rules for ion conductors and opto-ionic materials.</p>

            <p>We study the Mpemba effect on a non-equilibrium Markov chain that mimics the run and tumble motion of an active particle in a discrete energy landscape. The broken detailed balance, rendered by the activity, gives rise to a unique anomalous relaxation in the system which is distinctly different than the typical equilibrium systems. We observe that the activity can both suppress or induce the Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we report an oscillatory Mpemba effect where the relaxation trajectories, emanating from the hot and cold initial conditions, cross each other multiple times and this occurs due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in the relaxation spectrum due to the activity. Our work reveals a possible pathway for studying the Mpemba effect in active living systems where broken detailed balance is crucial to achieve many biological functions.</p>

            <p>A longstanding goal in colloidal active matter is to understand how gradients in fuel concentration influence the motion of phoretic Janus particles. Here, we present a theoretical description of the motion of a spherical phoretic Janus particle in the presence of a radial gradient of the chemical solute driving self-propulsion. Radial gradients are a geometry relevant to many scenarios in active matter systems and naturally arise due to the presence of a point source or sink of fuel. We derive an analytical solution for the Janus particle's velocity and quantify the influence of the radial concentration gradient on the particle's trajectory. Compared to a phoretic Janus particle in a linear gradient in fuel concentration, we uncover a much richer set of dynamical behaviors, including circular orbits and trapped stationary states. We identify the ratio of the phoretic mobilities between the two domains of the Janus particle as a central quantity in tuning their dynamics. Our results provide a path for developing novel protocols for tuning the dynamics of phoretic Janus particles and mixing fluid at the microscale. In addition, this work suggests a method for quantifying the surface properties of phoretic Janus particles, which have proven challenging to probe experimentally.</p>

            <p>Liquid mixtures of many interacting components often exhibit numerous coexisting types of droplets. An exciting example is the cytosol of biological cells, where diverse droplets, called condensates, are essential for cellular function. However, how much their formation is constrained by thermodynamics is currently unclear. Linear stability analysis predicts that homogeneous mixtures become more robust to fluctuations as the number of components increases, suggesting that droplets do not form easily in multicomponent mixtures. In contrast, we show through numerical simulations and analytical scaling laws that the number of coexisting phases typically increases with the number of components in equilibrium. The combination of both results suggests that generic multicomponent mixtures can maintain many metastable states with various droplets, generalizing the nucleation-and-growth regime of binary mixtures. Our theory also indicates why cells exhibit much fewer condensates than components and how they could exploit multistability to independently form various condensates.</p>

            <p>During overflow metabolism, cells excrete glycolytic byproducts when growing under aerobic conditions in a seemingly wasteful fashion. While potentially advantageous for microbes with finite oxidative capacity, its role in higher organisms is harder to assess. Recent single-cell experiments suggest overflow metabolism arises due to imbalances in inter-cellular exchange networks. We quantitatively characterize this scenario by integrating spatial metabolic modeling with tools from statistical physics and experimental single-cell flux data. Our results provide a theoretical demonstration of how diffusion-limited exchanges shape the space of accessible multi-cellular metabolic states. Specifically, a phase transition from a balanced network of exchanges to an unbalanced, overflow regime occurs as mean glucose and oxygen uptake rates vary. Heterogeneous single-cell metabolic phenotypes occur near this transition. Time-resolved tumor-stroma co-culture data support the idea that overflow metabolism stems from failure of inter-cellular metabolic coordination. In summary, environmental control is an emergent multi-cellular property, rather than a cell-autonomous effect.</p>

            <p>As is well known, magnetic impurities adsorbed on superconductors, e.g. of the s-wave type, can introduce a bound gap-state (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonance). We here investigate within a minimal model how the impurity moment arranges with respect to a weak homogeneous internal magnetic field employing a fully self-consistent mean-field treatment. Our investigation reveals a critical window of impurity-to-substrate coupling constants, $J$. The width of the critical region, $\delta J$, scales like $\delta J \sim B/\Delta$, where $B$ is the magnitude of the internal field, that breaks the spin-rotation symmetry, and $\Delta$ is the bulk order parameter. While tuning $J$ through the window, the energy of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) resonance is pinned to the Fermi energy $\varepsilon_{\rm F}$ and the impurity moment rotates in a continuous fashion. We emphasize the pivotal role of self-consistency: In treatments ignoring self-consistency, the critical window adopts zero width, $\delta J=0$; consequently, there is no pinning of the YSR-resonance to $\varepsilon_{\rm F}$, the impurity orientation jumps and therefore this orientation cannot be controlled continuously by fine-tuning the coupling $J$. In this sense, our study highlights the significance of self-consistency for understanding intricate magnetic interactions between superconductive materials and Shiba chains.</p>

            <p>The combination of quantum geometry and magnetic geometry in magnets excites diverse phenomena, some critical for antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, very few material platforms have been predicted and experimentally verified to date, with the material pool restricted by the assumed need for strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we bypass the need for SOC by considering magnetic order induced quantum geometry and corresponding nonlinear transports (NLTs) in antiferromagnets (AFMs). By integrating spin space group theory into the symmetry analysis, we find that collinear and coplanar magnetic geometries can only induce NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and noncoplanar ones may trigger NLT driven by dipoles of Berry curvature, inverse mass, and quantum metric. Using this approach, we establish a materials database of 260 AFMs with SOC-free NLT effects, and complement this with first-principles calculations on several prototypical material candidates. Our work not only provides a universal theoretical framework for studying various magnetism-driven transport effects, but also predicts broad, experimentally accessible material platforms for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p>

            <p>The computational power and fault-tolerance of future large-scale quantum processors derive in large part from the connectivity between the qubits. One approach to increase connectivity is to engineer qubit-qubit interactions at a distance. Alternatively, the connectivity can be increased by physically displacing the qubits. This has been explored in trapped-ion experiments and using neutral atoms trapped with optical tweezers. For semiconductor spin qubits, several studies have investigated spin coherent shuttling of individual electrons, but high-fidelity transport over extended distances remains to be demonstrated. Here we report shuttling of an electron inside an isotopically purified Si/SiGe heterostructure using electric gate potentials. First, we form static quantum dots, and study how spin coherence decays as we repeatedly move a single electron between up to five dots. Next, we create a traveling wave potential to transport an electron in a moving quantum dot. This second method shows substantially better spin coherence than the first. It allows us to displace an electron over an effective distance of 10 $\mu$m in under 200 ns with an average fidelity of 99.5%. These results will guide future efforts to realize large-scale semiconductor quantum processors, making use of electron shuttling both within and between qubit arrays.</p>

The appropriate classical limit of the model allows us to obtain a phase diagram identifying different dynamical phases, especially the onset of chaos. Both classically and quantum mechanically, we demonstrate the emergence of a steady state in the chaotic regime and analyze its properties. The interplay between quantum fluctuation and chaos leads to enhanced mixing dynamics and dephasing, resulting in the formation of an incoherent photonic fluid. The steady state exhibits an intriguing phenomenon of subsystem thermalization even outside the chaotic regime; however, its effective temperature increases with the degree of chaos. Moreover, the statistical properties of the steady state show a close connection with the random matrix theory. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aneesh Agarwal, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Daniel Bennett, Robert-Jan Slager</p>
            <p>Following the recent interest in van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics, topologically nontrivial polar structures have been predicted to form in twisted bilayers. However, these structures have proven difficult to observe experimentally. We propose that these textures may be probed optically by showing that topological polarization textures result in exotic nonlinear optical responses. We derive this relationship analytically using non-Abelian Berry connections and a quantum-geometric framework, supported by tight-binding and first-principles calculations. For the case of moiré materials without centrosymmetry, which form networks of polar merons and antimerons, the shift photoconductivity forms a vortex-like structure in real space. For a range of frequencies where transitions between topologically trivial bands occur at the Brillouin zone edge, the shift photocurrents are antiparallel to the in-plane electronic polarization field. Our findings highlight the interplay between complex polarization textures and nonlinear optical responses in vdW materials and provide a sought-after strategy for their experimental detection.</p>

            <h2>Effect of the background flow on the motility induced phase separation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soni D. Prajapati, Akshay Bhatnagar, Anupam Gupta</p>
            <p>We simulate active Brownian particles (ABPs) with soft-repulsive interactions subjected to a four-roll-mill flow. In the absence of flow, this system exhibits motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). To investigate the interplay between MIPS and flow-induced mixing, we introduce dimensionless parameters: a scaled time, $\tau$, and a scaled velocity, ${\rm v}$, characterizing the ratio of ABP to fluid time and velocity scales, respectively. The parameter space defined by $\tau$ and ${\rm v}$ reveals three distinct ABP distribution regimes. At low velocities ${\rm v} \ll 1$, flow dominates, leading to a homogeneous mixture. Conversely, at high velocities ${\rm v} \gg 1$, motility prevails, resulting in MIPS. In the intermediate regime (${\rm v} \sim 1$), the system's behavior depends on $\tau$. For $\tau <1$, a moderately mixed homogeneous phase emerges, while for $\tau >1$, a novel phase, termed flow-induced phase separation (FIPS), arises due to the combined effects of flow topology and ABP motility and size. To characterize these phases, we analyze drift velocity, diffusivity, mean-squared displacement, giant number fluctuations, radial distribution function, and cluster-size distribution.</p>

            <h2>Three-dimensional Abelian and non-Abelian gauge Higgs theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>Gauge symmetries and Higgs mechanisms are key features of theories describing high-energy particle physics and collective phenomena in statistical and condensed-matter physics. In this review we address the collective behavior of systems of multicomponent scalar fields interacting with gauge fields, which can be already present in the underlying microscopic system or emerge only at criticality. The interplay between local gauge and global symmetries determines the phase diagram, the nature of the Higgs phases, and the nature of phase transitions between the high-temperature disordered and the low-temperature Higgs phases. However, additional crucial features determine the universal properties of the critical behavior at continuous transitions. Specifically, their nature also depends on the role played by the gauge modes at criticality. Effective (Abelian or non-Abelian) gauge Higgs field theories emerge when gauge modes develop critical correlations. On the other hand, a more standard critical behavior, which admits an effective description in terms of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\Phi^4$ theories, occurs when gauge-field modes are short ranged at the transition. In the latter case, gauge fields only prevent non-gauge invariant correlation functions from becoming critical. This review covers the recent progress made in the study of Higgs systems with Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. We discuss the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of systems with a classical partition function, focusing mainly on three-dimensional systems, and only briefly discussing two-dimensional models. However, by using the quantum-to-classical mapping, the results on the critical behavior for classical systems in $D=d+1$ dimensions can be extended to quantum transitions in $d$ dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Optical Manifestations of Quantum Geometry in Electron-Phonon Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaming Hu, Wenbin Li, Zhichao Guo, Hua Wang, Kai Chang</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry is crucial for understanding intricate condensed matter systems, governing transport phenomena and optical responses. However, traditional studies predominantly consider a static crystal lattice, focusing exclusively on the pure-electronic quantum geometry of the Hilbert space parameterized by electronic wave vectors, thereby overlooking the dynamic effects arising from phonons and their coupling with electrons. In this work, we reveal the intrinsic quantum geometry of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC), which resides in the hybrid Hilbert space parameterized by both the electronic wave vectors and phonon displacements. The EPC quantum metric, EPC Berry curvature and EPC shift vector, as central elements, quantify the EPC-induced velocity, polarization, and anomalous charge-center shift, respectively. We further connect this geometry to phonon-mediated optical responses, particularly in-gap resonances, enabling experimental detection and characterization of EPC quantum geometry.</p>

The vortices and antivortices carry fractional charges of equal sign but unequal magnitude and have a honeycomb lattice structure that contrasts with the triangular lattices of superconducting electron-electron-pair vortex lattices. We predict that increasing charge density or weakening magnetic field drives a vortex delocalization transition that would be signaled experimentally by an abrupt increase in counterflow transport resistance.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate novel laser-induced relaxation oscillations in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). These oscillations appear when a voltage biased NbTiN nanobridge detector is illuminated with intense pulsed laser light at a repetition rate of $\sim19\text{MHz}$. They differ from the well-known relaxation oscillations by a step-wise increase in frequency and phase locking of the oscillations to the laser pulses. We create a model that incorporates electrical feedback and excludes thermal effects to simulate and explain the origin of the observed laser-induced relaxation oscillations. Qualitative agreement to the experiment is achieved using realistic values for the parameters in the model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weizhao Chen, Yu Zhang, Yi Liu, Zhe Yuan</p>
            <p>Based upon first-principles calculations, we report ultralow Gilbert damping in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets. The low damping occurs at low temperature because mirror symmetry prohibits intraband transitions. The monotonic dependence on the electronic scattering rate suggests the absent lower limit, in contrast to conventional ferromagnetic materials. Breaking mirror symmetry through magnetization rotation, layer stacking, or structural phase transition significantly increases damping by enabling intraband transitions. Topological nodal lines, also protected by mirror symmetry, contribute substantially to interband-transition-mediated damping, which can be tuned by adjusting the Fermi level. Our findings elucidate the unique characteristics of Gilbert damping in 2D vdW ferromagnets, providing valuable insights for designing low-dimensional spintronic devices with high energy efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongting Hou, Long Zhang</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent observation of real-space edge modes with ultracold atoms [Braun et al., Nat. Phys. 20, 1306 (2024)], we investigate the preparation and detection of anomalous counterpropagating edge states -- a defining feature of the anomalous Floquet valley-Hall (AFVH) phase -- in a two-dimensional periodically driven optical Raman lattice. Modeling the atomic cloud with a Gaussian wave packet state, we explore, both analytically and numerically, how the population of edge modes depends on the initial-state parameters. In particular, we reveal that, in addition to the internal spin state, the initial momenta parallel and perpendicular to the boundary play essential roles: they independently control the selective population of edge states across distinct momenta and within separate quasienergy gaps. Furthermore, we examine the wave-packet dynamics of counterpropagating edge states and demonstrate that their characteristic motion is robust against long-range disorder. These results establish a theoretical framework for future experimental explorations of the AFVH phase and topological phenomena associated with its unique edge modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Cailleaux, Quentin Ficheux, Nicolas Roch, Denis M. Basko</p>
            <p>When a small system is coupled to a bath, it is generally assumed that the state of the bath remains unaffected by the system due to the bath's large number of degrees of freedom. Here we show theoretically that this assumption can be easily violated for photonic baths typically used in experiments involving superconducting circuits. We analyze the dynamics of a voltage-biased Josephson junction coupled to a photonic bath, represented as a long Josephson junction chain. Our findings show that the system can reach a non-equilibrium steady state where the photonic degrees of freedom become significantly overheated, leading to a qualitative change in the current-voltage $I-V$ curve. This phenomenon is analogous to the Joule effect observed in electrical conductors, where flowing current can substantially heat up electrons. Recognizing this effect is crucial for the many applications of high-impedance environments in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoxue Ran, Sylvain Capponi, Junchen Rong, Fabien Alet, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <p>Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a noncentrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its noncentrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirm that its structure is noncentrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa, whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.</p>

            <p>Ultracold atomic systems confined in optical cavities have been demonstrated as a laboratory for the control of quantum matter properties and analog quantum simulation. Often neglected, but soon amenable to manipulation in a new generation of experiments, we show that atomic many-body interactions allow additional control in the cavity driven self-organization of effective spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). We theoretically show that a rich landscape of magnetic ordering configurations emerges. This can be controlled by modifying the geometry of the light-fields in the system with the interplay of two-body interactions and the cavity induced interactions. This leads to competition scenarios and phase separated dynamics. Our results show that it is possible to tailor on demand configurations possibly useful for analog quantum simulation of magnetic materials with highly controllable parameters in a single experimentally realistic setup.</p>

Our winding number uses analytical continuation of the wave-vector into the complex plane and involves two special points on the full Riemann surface band structure that correspond to bulk eigenvector degeneracies. Our winding number is invariant under unitary or similarity transforms. We emphasize that the topological criteria we propose here differ from what is traditionally defined as a topological or trivial phase in symmetry-protected classification studies. It is a broader invariant for our model that supports nonzero energy edge states and its transition does not coincide with the gap closing condition. When the relevant symmetries are applied, our invariant reduces to well-known Hermitian and non-Hermitian symmetry-protected topological invariants.</p>

            <p>Lithium is a typical quantum solid, characterized by cubic structures at ambient pressure. As the pressure increases, it forms more complex structures and undergoes a metal-to-semiconductor transformation, complicating theoretical and experimental analyses. We employ the neural canonical transformation approach, an \textit{ab initio} variational method based on probabilistic generative models, to investigate the quantum anharmonic effects in lithium solids at finite temperatures. This approach combines a normalizing flow for phonon excited-state wave functions with a probabilistic model for the occupation of energy levels, optimized jointly to minimize the free energy. Our results indicate that quantum anharmonicity lowers the \textit{bcc}-\textit{fcc} transition temperature compared to classical molecular dynamics predictions. At high pressures, the predicted fractional coordinates of lithium atoms in the \textit{cI16} structure show good quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Finally, contrary to previous beliefs, we find that the poor metallic \textit{oC88} structure is stabilized by the potential energy surface obtained via high-accuracy electronic structure calculations, rather than thermal or quantum nuclear effects.</p>

            <p>We present numerical simulations of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the L$_{2,3}$ edge of Ni in the weakly ferromagnetic altermagnet NiF$_2$. Our results predict a significant XMCD signal for light propagating perpendicular to the magnetic moments, which are approximately aligned along the [100] easy-axis direction. The analysis shows that the altermagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions to the XMCD signal can be uniquely distinguished by their dependence on an applied magnetic field. By varying the angle of the field relative to the easy axis, the in-plane orientation of both the Néel vector and the net magnetization can be systematically controlled. We further demonstrate that the XMCD signal, even under fields as strong as 40 T and for any in-plane orientation, can be accurately described as a linear combination of two spectral components, with geometrical prefactors determined by the field magnitude and direction. This insight enables experimental validation of the distinctive relationship between the Néel vector orientation and the x-ray Hall vector in the rutile structure. Quantitative simulations supporting these findings are provided.</p>

            <h2>Optimal constrained control for generally damped Brownian heat engines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Monojit Chatterjee, Viktor Holubec, Rahul Marathe</p>
            <p>Optimization of cyclic stochastic heat engines, a topic spanning decades of research, commonly assumes fixed control or response parameters at discrete points in the cycle-a limitation that often leads to experimentally impractical protocols. We overcome this with a general algorithm, adapted from optimal control theory, that optimizes full-cycle dynamics under realistic constraints, such as stiffness and temperature bounds, across diverse systems. Unlike geometric or mass transport methods, which rely on fixed endpoints and are unsuitable for unconstrained cycles, our approach simultaneously tunes both cycle time and control variations. Applied to a generally damped Brownian particle in a harmonic potential-an experimentally relevant case-our method is validated in the overdamped regime and extended to arbitrary damping rates. As damping decreases, maximum power vanishes and cycle time diverges; at fixed cycle times, efficiency follows a similar trend, with optimal protocols exhibiting non-monotonic complexity. Notably, optimizing temperature profiles-often overlooked-significantly enhances efficiency in intermediate damping regimes. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for optimizing cyclic stochastic processes under experimental constraints, broadening the scope of power and efficiency optimization in nonequilibrium thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>We study the effects of H2O on CO2 adsorption in an amine-appended variant of the metal-organic framework Mg2(dobpdc), which is known to exhibit chaining behavior that presents in a step-shaped adsorption isotherm. We first show how the presence of different levels of local H2O affects this chaining behavior and the energetics of CO2 adsorption, based on a series of ab initio calculations, giving insight into the atomic-scale environment. In particular, we predict a novel adsorbed configuration, in which H2O and CO2 intertwine to make a braided chain down the MOF pore. We then show how an existing lattice model can be adapted to incorporate the effect of water, and predict the CO2 isotherms for the various water levels, observing a sharp shift the uptake at low partial pressures. The manifestation of this braided chain in the lattice model points to the potential emergence of a shift from cooperative capture to that of a phase transition. In addition to the physical insights, this work may serve as a launching off point for further work on this and related materials.</p>

Exact analytical expressions for the long-time diffusion constant and drift along the channel are derived to next-to-leading order in the limit of small channel period. Using these results we show how an effective model for Taylor dispersion in tortuous porous media can be framed in terms of dispersion in a uniform channel with absorption/desorption at its surface, an effective slip length for the flow at the surface and an effective, universal, diffusion constant on the surface. This work thus extends the concept of an effective slip-length for hydrodynamics flows to Taylor dispersion by those flows. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical calculations, and present a robust method to understand and upscale the transport properties of flows in porous media.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical study of the dissipative dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model induced by on-site or long-range two-body losses. We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses.</p>

            <p>Superconducting systems based on attractive electron-phonon interactions are the ones which are best understood at a fundamental level. They are well described using Eliashberg theory, which, unlike BCS theory, explicitly takes into account phonon dynamics. It is most often assumed that only linear electron-phonon interactions are relevant. However, for some superconductors like MgB$_2$ or hydride based superconductors, nonlinear electron-phonon interactions are known to contribute significantly, which is not taken into account in conventional Eliashberg theory. We provide a modification to Eliashberg theory by introducing nonlinear electron-phonon interactions. We show that the Eliashberg equations remain unchanged apart from a nonlinear extension of the Eliashberg spectral function. This extended spectral function can be used as a baseline for future ab initio calculations. We use it to construct an analytical toy model and show that the nonlinear electron-phonon coupling affects the superconducting gap function on the imaginary and real axis and causes an increase in the superconducting critical temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ha Quang Trung, Qianhui Xu, Bo Yang</p>
            <p>Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments have revealed that superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can emerge from a valley-polarized and, hence, chiral normal state. The interplay of pairing and the reduced normal-state symmetries sparked widespread interest. In this work, we demonstrate within a microscopic theoretical formalism that this stabilizes a non-reciprocal superconducting state. Our results are based on a fully self-consistent framework for determining the superconducting order parameter from a Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. We show that the system displays a sizeable intrinsic superconducting diode effect, i.e., without the need for applying external magnetic fields, which is also highly tunable by an external displacement field. Moreover, we find that the angular dependence of the critical current is highly sensitive to the Fermi surfaces of the normal state. Hence, our results suggest that the critical current could provide insights into the type of Fermi surface topology from which superconductivity arises.</p>

            <h2>Quantum shockwave at the quasi-relativistic resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marinko Jablan</p>
            <p>Shockwaves are violent nonlinear distortions of wave motion which have been reported in fluid waves and electromagnetic waves, while here we reveal that a shockwave can occur even in the quantum wave function of a single particle. Specifically, we analyze the electromagnetic field travelling on resonance with the limiting velocity of the quasi-relativistic particle, and reveal that a strong longitudinal field can rip up a quantum shockwave singularity in the particle wave function, leading to energy dissipation. Moreover, we show that this effect is particularly strong for quasi-relativistic (Dirac) electrons in graphene for two reasons. On one hand, we obtain the single-particle shockwave at very small fields due to the small effective electron mass, and on the other hand we can obtain large dissipation in the many-particle shockwave by using the large electron density in graphene. While the single-particle shockwave can be most easily observed by locating the shockwave singularity with a high-resolution microscopy, the many-particle dissipation would be simply observed as a rapid decay of our resonant electromagnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Preliminary experimental investigation on the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Durbar Roy, Ikbal Ahmed, Abdul Hakkim, Rama Govindarajan</p>
            <p>We study the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow experimentally using optical diagnostics in the Shields and Froude parameter space ($0.05{\leq}{\theta}{\leq}0.32$, $0.1{\leq}Fr{\leq}0.4$). Interactions between the turbulent flow and the granular structure give rise to transient erosion-deposition dynamics leading to various types of particle transport. The subaqueous structures in the channel bed evolves due to shear-stress-induced erosion, gravity-driven deposition, and subsequent particle transport. We study the centroid motion and the granular structure shape evolution. At lower end of our ${\theta}-Fr$ parameter space, we observe no erosion and the structure remains at rest. We show that the critical Shields number (${\theta}_{cr}$) is of the order of $0.1$ beyond which erosion starts to occur. At intermediate values of ${\theta}$ and $Fr$ we observe slow erosion, resulting in a rigid body motion of the granular structure without significant shape deformation. Higher values of ${\theta}$ and $Fr$ causes vortex formation at the upstream of the dune resulting in stronger erosion, rapid shape deformation and relatively higher translation velocity of the centroid.</p>

            <h2>Spin stiffnesses and stability of magnetic order in the lightly doped two-dimensional Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Demetrio Vilardi, Pietro M. Bonetti, Walter Metzner</p>
            <p>We analyze the density dependence of the spin stiffnesses and the stability of magnetic order with respect to quantum fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model close to half-filling. The stiffnesses are computed from the spin susceptibility obtained from a random phase approximation in a magnetically ordered state. For a sizable next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and a moderate Hubbard interaction, the mean-field ground state is a Néel antiferromagnet in the electron doped regime at and above half-filling, and a planar circular spiral state in the hole doped regime below half-filling. Upon electron doping, the Néel stiffness decreases smoothly and not very steeply. By contrast, the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses in the spiral state drop abruptly at half-filling. The out-of-plane stiffness even drops to zero, and then increases again very slowly upon increasing hole doping. At finite temperatures, the Néel-to-spiral transition is shifted into the hole doped regime, the stiffnesses are continuous functions of the density, and they vanish at the transition. For small hole doping, the spin stiffnesses describe the quantum fluctuations only in a small momentum range, which shrinks to zero upon approaching half-filling. Using the above results, we show that the quantum ground state of the lightly electron doped Hubbard model remains Néel ordered, while quantum fluctuations probably destroy the spiral long-range order in the hole doped regime, giving rise to a quantum disordered state with a spin gap.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moirangthem Sanahal, Subhasis Panda, Snehasish Nandy</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a hallmark of non-Hermitian systems, stems from the topological nature of complex energy spectra, typically characterized by a nonzero spectral winding number. By investigating a one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model with spin-dependent Abelian gauge fields, we uncover a tunable, spin-polarized, unconventional NHSE with zero spectral winding, coexisting with a conventional one. These unconventional skin modes, emerging in the absence of pseudo time-reversal symmetry, display scale-restricted localization and non-Bloch spectral stability, distinguishing them from the Z2 and critical NHSEs. By introducing an external magnetic field that couples the spin degrees of freedom, these unconventional skin modes evolve into critical skin states. Meanwhile, conventional ones persist, but undergo a transition from bidirectional to unidirectional accumulation with increasing field strength. While distinct, remarkably, this unconventional NHSE manifests a more general behavior, with the Z2 and critical NHSEs emerging as specific limiting cases. Our results provide experimentally accessible predictions relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems with synthetic gauge fields.</p>

            <p>Topological phases of matter can appear in noninteracting systems, as in band topology, or interacting systems, such as in spin models, with their defining features typically robust against weak disorder. Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>This study benchmarks the GFN family of semiempirical methods (GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, GFN0-xTB, and GFN-FF) against density functional theory (DFT) for the evaluation of optimized molecular geometries and electronic properties of small organic semiconductor molecules. This work offers a systematic assessment of these computationally efficient quantum chemical methods and their accuracy-cost profiles when applied to a challenging class of systems, characterized, for instance, by extended $\pi$-conjugation, conformational flexibility, and sensitivity of properties to subtle structural changes. Two datasets are evaluated: a QM9-derived subset of small organic molecules and the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) database of extended $\pi$-systems relevant to organic photovoltaics. Structural agreement is quantified using heavy-atom RMSD, equilibrium rotational constants, bond lengths, and angles, while electronic property prediction is assessed via HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. Computational efficiency is assessed via CPU time and scaling behavior. GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB demonstrate the highest structural fidelity, while GFN-FF offers an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, particularly for larger systems. The results indicate that GFN-based methods are suitable for high-throughput molecular screening of small organic semiconductors, with the choice of method depending on accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings support the deployment of GFN approaches in computational pipelines for the discovery of organic electronics and materials, providing information on their strengths and limitations relative to established DFT methods.</p>

            <p>Application of a displacement field opens a gap and enhances the Van-Hove singularities in the band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. By adjusting the carrier density so that the Fermi energy lies in the vicinity of these singularities, recent experiments observe a plethora of highly correlated electronic phases including isospin polarized phases and high-resistance states with non-linear electric transport indicative of a possible Wigner crystal. We perform Hartree-Fock calculations incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions and allowing for translational and rotational symmetry breaking. We obtain the displacement field vs. carrier density phase diagram which shows isospin polarized metallic phases tracking the Van-Hove singularity in the valence band. Between these metallic phases we observe regions where the ground state is a Wigner crystal. The isospin polarization of the Wigner crystals tracks the isospin polarization of the nearby metallic phases. Depending on whether we have four, three, two or one isospin flavours, we obtain a full, three-quarter, half or quarter Wigner crystal.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiefeng Ye, Zhigao Huang, Xianxin Wu, Jian-Min Zhang</p>
            <p>Fermionic and bosonic localized states induced by geometric frustration in the kagome lattice provide a distinctive research platform for investigating emergent exotic quantum phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Here, we report the discovery of coexisting electronic and phononic flat bands induced by geometric frustration in a novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba). The electronic flat band is located around the Fermi level and possesses a nontrivial topological invariant with Z2=1. Additionaly, we identify multiple van Hove singularities (vHS) arise from the kagome Pd d orbitals with distinct dispersion and sublattice features, including conventional, higher-order vHS and p-type, m-type vHS. Specifically, our investigation of the vibrational modes of the phononic flat band reveals that its formation originates from destructive interference between adjacent kagome lattice sites with antiphase vibrational modes. A spring-mass model of phonons is established to probe the physical mechanism of the phononic flat bands. Furthermore, the calculations of electron-phonon coupling in the XPd5 reveal superconducting ground states with critical temperatures (Tc) of 4.25 K, 2.75 K, and 3.35 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively. This work provides a promising platform to explore the Fermion-boson many-body interplay and superconducting states, while simultaneously establishing a novel analytical framework to elucidate the origin of phononic flat bands in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Orbital Dynamics in Strongly Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. S. Miñarro, G. Herranz</p>
            <p>The interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom gives rise to a variety of emergent phases in correlated 4d and 5d transition-metal systems. Strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) significantly alters Jahn-Teller (JT) physics, often suppressing static distortions or promoting dynamic fluctuations, thereby reducing or even quenching orbital polarization. While intersite hybridization is a fundamental aspect of crystalline solids, its role in shaping the dynamics of spin-orbit-entangled states has received comparatively little attention. Here, we show that electronic hopping can locally restore orbital polarization when the ground state is perturbed, even in the absence of static orbital order. Using a Matsubara lattice formalism, we analyze how local orbital perturbations propagate through correlated, spin-orbit-entangled systems. When intersite hopping is included, such perturbations induce short-range orbital polarization with a characteristic orthogonal response at nearest-neighbor sites. Although the energy scale of these hybridization-driven orbital reconstructions likely makes their detection challenging, they may still influence low-energy spectral features and interact with other excitations. These results underscore the importance of including orbital dynamics in the interpretation of spectroscopic data and provide a framework for understanding dynamical responses in spin-orbit-entangled materials.</p>

We utilize simulations of reaction-diffusion systems, stochastic models for population dynamics and epidemic spreading, to exemplify how interdisciplinary computational research can be effectively utilized in bottom-up undergraduate and graduate education through learning by doing. We also give helpful hints for the practical implementation of Monte Carlo algorithms, provide sample codes, explain some typical data analysis tools, and describe various potential error sources and pitfalls and tips for avoiding them.</p>

It includes temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and figure of merit (ZT), along with metadata on materials and their corresponding publications. A self-consistent ZT (Sc-ZT) filter set was developed to measure ZT errors by comparing reported ZT's from figures with ZT's recalculated from digitized TEPs. Using this Sc-ZT protocol, we generated tMatDb272, comprising 14,717 temperature-property pairs from 272 high-quality TEP sets across 262 publications. The method identifies various types of ZT errors, such as resolution error, publication bias, ZT overestimation, interpolation and extrapolation error, and digitization noise, and excludes inconsistent samples from the dataset. teMatDb272 and the Sc-ZT filtering framework offer a robust dataset for data-driven and machine-learning-based materials design, device modeling, and future thermoelectric research.</p>

            <p>The newly discovered family of non-magnetic Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) offers a unique platform for studying the interplay between a charge density wave transition with superconductivity, non-trivial topology, and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry. Despite characterizing the charge density wave phase is crucial to understand and model all these exotic properties, it remains unresolved. In this work, we use first-principles calculations of the free-energy, incorporating both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results reveal a competition between metastable stacking orders of the reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers, which are energetically favored to form exclusively a triangular-hexagonal arrangement, allowing the possibility of competitive different domains and chiral order. Consistent with experimental observations, we find that the $2\times2\times2$ and $2\times2\times4$ modulations are nearly degenerate in free energy, and are abruptly melted into the high-symmetry hexagonal phase around 90 K. The transition is first-order but compatible with a measurable phonon-softening. Remarkably, even if the six-fold and inversion symmetry are intrinsically broken by the out-of-plane stacking, this does not lead to measurable anisotropy in the in-plane conductivity as suggested by measurements.</p>

            <p>Hierarchical dynamics in glass-forming systems span multiple timescales, from fast vibrations to slow structural rearrangements, appearing in both supercooled fluids and glassy states. Understanding how these diverse processes interact across timescales remains a central challenge. Here, by combining direct particle-level observations with a dynamic eigenmode approach that decomposes intermediate-timescale responses into distinct modes, we reveal the microscopic organisation of relaxation dynamics in two-dimensional colloidal systems. We identify five classes of modes characterizing hierarchical dynamics: (i) quasi-elastic modes, (ii) slow-reversible string modes contributing to dynamic heterogeneity, (iii) slow-irreversible string modes leading to flow, (iv) fast-$\beta$ modes with fast-reversible strings, and (v) random noise modes. The emergence of quasi-elastic modes marks the onset of glassy dynamics, while reversible string modes dominate dynamic heterogeneity throughout both supercooled and glassy regimes. Our findings offer a unified microscopic framework for understanding how distinct relaxation processes interconnect across timescales, illuminating the mechanisms driving glass formation.</p>

            <p>Today, multiple new platforms are implementing qudits, $d$-level quantum bases of information, for Quantum Information Processing (QIP). It is therefore crucial to study their efficiencies for QIP compared to more traditional qubit platforms. We present a comparative study of the infidelity scalings of a qudit and $n$-qubit systems, both with identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy environments. The first-order response of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) to the noise in the Lindblad formalism, which was found to be gate-independent, was calculated analytically in the two systems being compared. This yielded a critical curve $O(d^2/\log_2(d))$ of the ratio of their respective gate times in units of decoherence time. This quantity indicates how time-efficient operations on these systems are. The curve delineates regions where each system has a higher rate of increase of the AGI than the other. This condition on gate efficiency was applied to different existing platforms. It was found that specific qudit platforms possess gate efficiencies competitive with state-of-the-art qubit platforms. Numerical simulations complemented this work and allowed for discussion of the applicability and limits of the linear response formalism.</p>

We leverage xAI insights and molecular counterfactuals to design alternatives to problematic compounds in drug screening libraries. Additionally, we experimentally validate the MEGAN prediction classification for one of the counterfactuals and demonstrate the utility of counterfactuals for altering the aggregation properties of a compound through minor structural modifications. The integration of this method in high-throughput screening approaches will help combat and circumvent false positives, providing better lead molecules more rapidly and thus accelerating drug discovery cycles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiv Akshar Yadavalli, Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>By combining multiple copies of noisy coherent states of light (or other bosonic systems), it is possible to obtain a single mode in a state with lesser noise, a process known as distillation or purification of coherent states. We investigate the distillation of coherent states from coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations, and find a distillation protocol that is optimal in the asymptotic regime, i.e., when the number of input copies is much greater than 1. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, the error -- as quantified by infidelity (one minus the fidelity) of the output state with the desired coherent state -- is proportional to the inverse of the purity of coherence of the input state, a quantity obtained from the Right-Logarithmic-Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric, hence revealing an operational interpretation of this quantity. The heart of this protocol is a phase-insensitive channel that optimally converts an input coherent thermal state with high amplitude, into an output with significantly lower amplitude and temperature. Under this channel, the purity of coherence remains asymptotically conserved. While both the input and desired output are Gaussian states, we find that the optimal protocol cannot be a Gaussian channel. Among Gaussian phase-insensitive channels, the optimal distillation protocol is a simple linear optical scheme that can be implemented with beam splitters.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that a quantum field theory (QFT) in general two-dimensional curved spacetimes can be realized by a system of quantum spins or qubits. We consider a spin-1/2 model on a one-dimensional ring with spatially and temporally varying exchange couplings and magnetic fields. This model reduces to a QFT of Majorana fermions in the continuum limit. From this correspondence, we establish a dictionary for translating between the spacetime-dependent parameters of the spin model and the general metric on which the QFT is defined. After addressing the general case, we consider the Friedmann-Lema\^ıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric as a simple example. According to the dictionary, the QFT of Majorana fermions on the FLRW metric corresponds to the Ising model with a time-dependent transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that the production of Majorana particles in the expanding universe can be simulated with the transverse-field Ising model by increasing the strength of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we examine the Unruh effect through the spin system by using our prescription and show the direct relation between the entanglement (or modular) Hamiltonian in the spin system and the Rindler Hamiltonian. This approach provides an experimentally viable system for probing various phenomena in QFT within curved spacetime, while also opening the door to uncovering nontrivial phenomena in spin systems inspired by curved spacetime physics. It offers fresh perspectives on both QFT in curved spacetimes and quantum many-body spin systems, revealing profound connections between these fields.</p>

            <p>Increasing the number of particles in a system often leads to qualitative changes in its properties, such as breaking of symmetries and the appearance of phase transitions. This renders a macroscopic system fundamentally different from its individual microscopic constituents. Lying between these extremes, mesoscopic systems exhibit microscopic fluctuations that influence behavior on longer length scales, leading to critical phenomena and dynamics. Therefore, tracing the properties of well-controlled mesoscopic systems can help bridge the gap between an exact description of few-body microscopic systems and the emergent description of many-body systems. Here, we explore mesoscopic signatures of an optomechanical self-organization phase transition using arrays of cold atoms inside an optical cavity. By precisely engineering atom-cavity interactions, we reveal how critical behavior depends on atom number, identify characteristic dynamical behaviors in the self-organized regime, and observe a finite optomechanical susceptibility at the critical point. These findings advance our understanding of particle-number- and time-resolved properties of phase transitions in mesoscopic systems.</p>

First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problem of deciding whether or not a given set is a good approximation to a design. Given a certain promise gap that could be constant, we show that this problem is $\textsf{PP}$-hard, highlighting the inherent computational difficulty of determining properties of unitary and state designs. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effect of dissipation on the dynamics of edge modes in the monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our study considers both a linear observable and a nonlinear entanglement measure, namely the two-point correlation function and the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE), as diagnostic tools. While dissipation inevitably alters the entanglement properties observed in the closed system, statistical analysis of quantum trajectories reveals that by protecting the chain's edges from dissipation, it is possible to recover characteristic features analogous to those found in the unitary limit. This highlights the fundamental role of spatial dissipation patterns in shaping the dynamics of edge modes in monitored systems.</p>

            <h2>A Generation Framework with Strict Constraints for Crystal Materials Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Huang, Jiahui Chen, Chen Chen, Chunyan Chen, Renjie Su, Shiyu Du, ChenChen, Hongrui Liang, Daojing Lin</p>
            <p>The design of crystal materials plays a critical role in areas such as new energy development, biomedical engineering, and semiconductors. Recent advances in data-driven methods have enabled the generation of diverse crystal structures. However, most existing approaches still rely on random sampling without strict constraints, requiring multiple post-processing steps to identify stable candidates with the desired physical and chemical properties. In this work, we present a new constrained generation framework that takes multiple constraints as input and enables the generation of crystal structures with specific chemical and properties. In this framework, intermediate constraints, such as symmetry information and composition ratio, are generated by a constraint generator based on large language models (LLMs), which considers the target properties. These constraints are then used by a subsequent crystal structure generator to ensure that the structure generation process is under control. Our method generates crystal structures with a probability of meeting the target properties that is more than twice that of existing approaches. Furthermore, nearly 100% of the generated crystals strictly adhere to predefined chemical composition, eliminating the risks of supply chain during production.</p>

            <h2>Strong-coupling quantum thermodynamics using a superconducting flux qubit</h2>

            <p>Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit, which is capable of reaching strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes, as shown in previous studies. Here, we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with two cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude those in earlier experiments. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current mediated by photons by applying magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, our experiment opens new possibilities for quantum thermodynamics, aiming to realize true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, by leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and its environment in future experiments.</p>

            <h2>Software-defined lock-in demodulator for low-frequency resistance noise measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Thyzel</p>
            <p>The resolution of low-frequency resistance noise measurements can be increased by amplitude modulation, shifting the spectrum of the resistance fluctuations away from the 1/f noise contributed by measurement instruments. However, commercial lock-in amplifiers used for de-modulating the fluctuations exhibit a problematic 1/f noise contribution, which imposes a hard lower limit on the relative resistance noise that can be detected. We replace the lock-in amplifier hardware by equivalent digital signal processing performed using open-source software and off-the-shelf data acquisition systems. Compared to previous implementations of the lock-in principle, our solution offers real-time preview capabilities and is resource-efficient for long acquisition times at high sampling rates. Importantly, compared to high-end commercial lock-in instruments, our system offers superior low-frequency noise performance with a reduction of the voltage power spectral density by about two orders of magnitude.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dario Benedetti, Edoardo Lauria, Dalimil Mazáč, Philine van Vliet</p>
            <p>We study the 1d Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. The critical model corresponds to a family of 1d conformal field theories (CFTs) whose data depends nontrivially on $s$ in the range $1/2\leq s\leq 1$. The model is known to be described by a generalized free field with quartic interaction, which is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled near the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We propose a dual description which becomes weakly coupled at $s=1$. At $s=1$, our model becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition for the 2d free scalar. We perform a number of consistency checks of our proposal and calculate the perturbative CFT data around $s=1$ analytically using both 1) our proposed field theory and 2) the analytic conformal bootstrap. Our results show complete agreement between the two methods.</p>

We present a comprehensive analysis of these traveling bubbles and identify three qualitatively distinct regions within the one-parameter family of solutions, classified by velocity: (i) well-separated phase singularities at low velocity, (ii) singularities within the same density dip at intermediate velocity, and (iii) rarefaction pulses without singularities at higher (subsonic) velocities. Then, we generalize the discussion to unstable cases, incorporating higher order vortex-antivortex pairs and arrays of vortices that move cohesively with a common velocity within the fluid. In all cases, we provide analytic approximations that aid the understanding of the results in different regimes.</p>

            <p>Rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. The availability of numerous rotational states has inspired many proposed applications, including simulations of quantum magnetism, encodings of information in high-dimensional qudits, and synthetic dimensions with many synthetic lattice sites. Many of these applications are yet to be realised, primarily because engineering long-lived coherent superpositions of multiple rotational states is highly challenging. Here, we investigate how multilevel coherences between rotational states can be engineered by using optical tweezer traps operating close to a magic wavelength for a given pair of states. By performing precision Ramsey spectroscopy we find the exact magic wavelengths and sensitivities to detuning errors for multiple rotational state superpositions. We find that, for a trap polarised parallel to the quantisation axis, the magic wavelengths are closely clustered enabling long-lived coherence across multiple rotational states simultaneously. As an example, we demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. With modest experimental improvements, we predict that second-scale coherent dynamics of ten rotational states should be readily achievable.</p>

            <p>Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric geometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. Exact solutions and numerical results of selected examples are presented. For the $j = 3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase exhibits finite-temperature topological phase transitions characterized by abrupt jumps. The IGP for the same state similarly shows discontinuous jumps as the temperature varies. In the case of the $j = 1$ one-axis SSS, both Uhlmann phase and IGP display discrete finite-temperature jumps. By contrast, the $j = 1$ two-axis SSS shows no such transitions because the Uhlmann phase and IGP both vary smoothly with temperature. We also briefly discuss potential realizations and simulations related to these phenomena in spin systems.</p>

            <h2>Why do financial prices exhibit Brownian motion despite predictable order flow?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa</p>
            <p>In financial market microstructure, there are two enigmatic empirical laws: (i) the market-order flow has predictable persistence due to metaorder splitters by institutional investors, well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. However, this phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii) the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. Here we theoretically reveal why price dynamics follows Brownian motion despite predictable order flow by unifying these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable Lévy-walk model. Our exact solution shows that the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under persistent order flow. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in mitigating large price movements by large metaorders, thereby leading to the Brownian price dynamics, consistently with the efficient market hypothesis over long timescales.</p>

            <p>We present high-performance implementations of the two-dimensional Ising and Blume-Capel models for large-scale, multi-GPU simulations. Our approach takes full advantage of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system, which features up to $72$ GPUs interconnected via high-bandwidth NVLink, enabling direct GPU-to-GPU memory access across multiple nodes. By utilizing Fabric Memory and an optimized Monte Carlo kernel for the Ising model, our implementation supports simulations of systems with linear sizes up to $L=2^{23}$, corresponding to approximately $70$ trillion spins. This allows for a peak processing rate of nearly $1.15 \times 10^5$ lattice updates per nanosecond-setting a new performance benchmark for Ising model simulations. Additionally, we introduce a custom protocol for computing correlation functions, which strikes an optimal balance between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. This protocol enables large-scale simulations without incurring prohibitive runtime costs. Benchmark results show near-perfect strong and weak scaling up to $64$ GPUs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for large-scale statistical physics simulations.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous matrix product operator symmetries and 1D mixed-state phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Qi Sun</p>
            <p>The renormalization group for matrix product density operators (MPDOs) provides a powerful framework for describing one-dimensional mixed-state phases of matter and the renormalization fixed points (RFPs) are representative states for analyzing nontrivial phases. Recently, it was found that anomalous symmetries can provide a fundamental obstruction for certain short-range correlated mixed states to be efficiently prepared. In this work, we consider generalized symmetries including non-invertible ones realized microscopically as matrix product operators (MPOs), and study the physical implications of their quantum anomaly on the MPDO RFPs. We prove that MPDOs with strong anomalous MPO symmetries cannot be prepared from a normal matrix product state in the trivial phase via a translationally invariant finite-depth local quantum channel. We explicitly construct a general class of zero-correlation-length MPDO RFPs that exhibit strong anomalous MPO symmetries, and these MPDO RFPs form a distinct class from those that can be efficiently prepared as a consequence of quantum anomaly. Nonetheless, we further prove that all the constructed MPDO RFPs can be prepared from product states by finite-depth quantum circuit with measurements and feedforward.</p>

            <p>Normalization layers, such as Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization, are central components in modern neural networks, widely adopted to improve training stability and generalization. While their practical effectiveness is well documented, a detailed theoretical understanding of how normalization affects model behavior, starting from initialization, remains an important open question. In this work, we investigate how both the presence and placement of normalization within hidden layers influence the statistical properties of network predictions before training begins. In particular, we study how these choices shape the distribution of class predictions at initialization, which can range from unbiased (Neutral) to highly concentrated (Prejudiced) toward a subset of classes. Our analysis shows that normalization placement induces systematic differences in the initial prediction behavior of neural networks, which in turn shape the dynamics of learning. By linking architectural choices to prediction statistics at initialization, our work provides a principled understanding of how normalization can influence early training behavior and offers guidance for more controlled and interpretable network design.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Nafis Arafat, Oleg L. Berman, Godfrey Gumbs, Peter B. Littlewood</p>
            <p>We investigate Bose-Einstein condensation and two-component superfluidity composed of upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritons confined to a two-dimensional microcavity. By studying a modified Hamiltonian which incorporates interactions between both polariton branches, we derive the collective excitation spectrum and express the sound velocity as a function of detuning and Rabi splitting. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between effective masses and exciton-photon fractions in the UP and LP branches can significantly enhance the superfluid properties compared to a one-component condensate of only lower polaritons. Specifically, we discover that larger Rabi splitting increases the sound velocity and raises the critical temperature for superfluidity, while negative and positive detuning further favors a two-component condensate. Additionally, we demonstrate that these trends are consistent and applicable to various materials, including GaAs and the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), thereby indicating the potential for high-temperature superfluid phenomena in two-dimensional polariton systems. We hope these findings will provide a deeper understanding of the physics of structures containing multi-component polariton systems and generate experimental realizations of tunable quantum fluids with light.</p>

Crucially, the predicted magnon-magnon coupling is highly anisotropic, and observable in practical experiments. These exotic features are absent in conventional antiferromagnets.

            <p>The quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, first predicted in graphene by Kane and Mele in 2004, has emerged as a prototypical platform for exploring spin-orbit coupling, topology, and electronic interactions. Initially realized experimentally in quantum wells exhibiting characteristic QSH signatures, the field has since expanded with the discovery of van der Waals (vdW) materials. This review focuses on vdW systems, which offer unique advantages: their exposed surfaces enable a combination of surface-sensitive spectroscopic and microscopic tools for comprehensive detection of the QSH state; mechanical stacking with other vdW layers facilitates symmetry engineering and proximity effects; and moiré engineering introduces layer skyrmion topological phases and strong correlation effects. We highlight two monolayer families, 1T$^\prime$-MX$_2$ and MM$^\prime$X$_4$, represented by WTe$_2$ and TaIrTe$_4$, respectively. These materials exhibit QSH phases intertwined with or in close proximity to other quantum phases, such as excitonic insulators, charge density waves, and superconductivity. Their low crystal symmetry and topology enable rich quantum geometrical responses, ranging from nonlinear Hall effects to circular photogalvanic effects. We also discuss moiré systems, which combine topology with flatband physics and enhanced correlations, driving spontaneous symmetry breaking and transitions from QSH to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Remarkably, fractionalized QAH and QSH states have recently been observed in moiré systems, significantly advancing the field of condensed matter physics. Finally, we explore emerging applications of QSH and derived materials, such as using nonlinear Hall effects for quantum rectification in microwave energy harvesting and harnessing fractional anomalous states for topological quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Magneto-optics of low dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, offers a vast playground for exploring complex quantum phenomena. However, current \textit{ab initio} approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe\textsubscript{2}, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s--4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.</p>

            <p>Numerous experiments on pyrochlore oxides Pr$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf, Ir)$_2$O$_7$ with non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ions suggest that they support a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state, but the precise nature of the QSL remains unclear. Quantum spin ice with dominant dipolar Ising and smaller quadrupolar transverse exchange interactions is one such candidate, but a dominant inelastic neutron scattering signal suggests that such a picture may not be consistent with experimental results. The microscopic exchange couplings of these compounds are also not known, leaving room for many possible QSL states. In this work, we use Schwinger boson mean-field theory supplemented by a projective symmetry group classification to study possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs in pyrochlore magnets with dipolar-quadrupolar non-Kramers local moments. We build a mean-field phase diagram and find four QSLs in the frustrated region of parameter space that are consistent with inelastic signals observed in neutron scattering data on Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Among these, two robust QSLs occur in the regime with dominant transverse exchange rather than Ising exchange. We then compute the static and dynamic spin structure factors for these QSL candidates, which can be used to distinguish them in neutron scattering experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Hickey, Jeffrey G. Rau, Subhankar Khatua, Michel J. P. Gingras</p>
            <p>When magnetic moments are subject to competing or frustrated interactions, continuous degeneracies that are not protected by any symmetry of the parent Hamiltonian can emerge at the classical (mean-field) level. Such "accidental" degeneracies are often lifted by both thermal and quantum fluctuations via a mechanism known as order-by-disorder (ObD). The leading proposal to detect and characterize ObD in real materials, in a way that quantitatively distinguishes it from standard energetic selection, is to measure a small fluctuation-induced pseudo-Goldstone gap in the excitation spectrum. While the properties of this gap are known to leading order in the spin wave interactions, in both the zero-temperature and classical limits, the pseudo-Goldstone (PG) gap in quantum magnets at finite temperature has yet to be characterized. Using non-linear spin wave theory, we compute the PG gap to leading order in a $1/S$ expansion at low temperature for a variety of frustrated quantum spin systems. We also develop a formalism to calculate the PG gap in a way that solely uses linear spin-wave theory, circumventing the need to carry out tedious quantum many-body calculations. We argue that, at leading order, the PG gap acquires a distinct power-law temperature dependence, proportional to either $T^{d+1}$ or $T^{d/2+1}$ depending on the gapless dispersion of the PG mode predicted at the mean-field level. Finally, we examine the implications of these results for the pyrochlore oxide compound Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, for which there is compelling evidence of ObD giving rise to the experimentally observed long-range order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emerson Chiquillo</p>
            <p>Through an effective quantum field theory including zero temperature Gaussian fluctuations we derive analytical and explicit expressions for the equation of state of three-dimensional ultracold Rabi-coupled two-component bosonic gases with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions. At mean-field level the system presents two ground-states, one symmetric and one non-symmetric or unbalanced. For the symmetric ground state, in the regime where inter-species interactions are weakly attractive and subtly higher than repulsive intra-species, the instability by collapse is avoided by the contribution arising from Gaussian fluctuations, driving thus to formation of a liquidlike phase or droplet phase. This self-bound state is crucially affected by the dependence on the nonuniversal corrections to the interactions, which acts controlling the droplet stability. By tuning the ratio between the inter-species scattering length and the intra-species scattering lengths or the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions we address and establish conditions under which the formation and stability of self-bound Rabi-coupled droplets with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions is favorable.</p>

By combining numerical simulations, analysis and dynamical systems approaches, we show how active feedback drives complex nonlinear dynamics on multiple time-scales, including limit cycles and chaos. Our results suggest design principles for creating ultrafast actuators and autonomous machines from soft, chemically-powered solids.</p>

            <p>Suspensions of swimming particles exhibit complex collective behaviors driven by hydrodynamic interactions, showing persistent large-scale flows and long-range correlations. While heavily studied, it remains unclear how such structures depend on the system size and swimmer concentration. To address these issues, we simulate very large systems of suspended swimmers across a range of system sizes and volume fractions. For this we use high-performance simulation tools that build on slender body theory and implicit resolution of steric interactions. At low volume fractions and long times, the particle simulations reveal dynamic flow structures and correlation functions that scale with the system size. These results are consistent with a mean-field limit and agree well with a corresponding kinetic theory. At higher concentrations, the system departs from mean-field behavior. Flow structures become cellular, and correlation lengths scale with the particle size. Here, translational motion is suppressed, while rotational dynamics dominate. These findings highlight the limitations of dilute mean-field models and reveal new behaviors in dense active suspensions.</p>

            <p>Modern industry seeks next-generation microelectronics with ultra-low dissipation and noise beyond semiconducting systems, where the superconducting electronics offer promise. Its physical foundation is the superconducting diode effect (SDE) with nonreciprocal supercurrent. SDE has hitherto mainly relied on material-specific intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductors, suffering from low yield, controllability, and compatibility with further functional extension - an undesirable aspect for applications. Here, we demonstrated a field-free SDE due to the chemical potential shift from external circuit line resistance, which is generic and challenges the previous interpretations of the intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductivity for zero-field SDE. Moreover, this SDE is circuit-level configurable since it can be electrically switched on/off with its polarity and efficiency precisely modulated via gate voltage and circuit reconfiguration, facilitating functional extension. Such a generic, controllable and extensible SDE addresses critical challenges in dissipationless circuit towards application, and thus establishes a robust platform for scalable superconducting electronics.</p>

            <h2>Strain Modulated Catalytic Activity of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caique C. Oliveira, Pedro A. S. Autreto</p>
            <p>The catalytic properties of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) in hydrogen-electrode- (HER-) based catalysts have been investigated based on state-of-the-art ab initio simulations. Our results show that the late transition metal sites (Hg and Zn) exhibit the best activity for HER in an acidic environment. Furthermore, lattice stretching and compression can effectively modulate the H binding energy, achieving almost thermoneutral adsorption at 3% compressive strain. The changes are attributed to the modulation in the d-band centers of late transition metal sites, as well as the depletion of charge population on bonding states, contributing to the destabilization of the H-metal bonds. Our contribution explores strain engineering as an effective strategy to tailor the activity of 2D mineral-based catalyst materials for HER, advancing our understanding of how mechanical manipulation can effectively modulate the catalytic properties of these materials.</p>

            <p>We use event-driven pore network modeling to study the transport of hydrogel particles through disordered porous media -- a process that underlies diverse applications. By simulating particle advection, deformation, and clogging at the pore scale, we identify a dimensionless "squeezing parameter" that quantitatively predicts the depth to which particles penetrate into a given medium across diverse conditions. Our simulations also uncover a surprising cooperative effect: adding more particles enables them to penetrate deeper into the medium. This phenomenon arises because individual particles redirect fluid to adjacent throats, forcing nearby particles through tight pores that they would otherwise clog. Altogether, these results help to establish a quantitative framework that connects microscopic particle mechanics to macroscopic transport behavior.</p>

            <p>Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Almond - West Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law.

            <h2>Implementing advanced trial wave functions in fermion quantum Monte Carlo via stochastic sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Yu Xiao, Zixiang Lu, Yixiao Chen, Tao Xiang, Shiwei Zhang</p>
            <p>We introduce an efficient approach to implement correlated many-body trial wave functions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). To control the sign/phase problem in AFQMC, a constraint is derived from an exact gauge condition but is typically imposed approximately through a trial wave function or trial density matrix, whose quality can affect the accuracy of the method. Furthermore, the trial wave function can also affect the efficiency through importance sampling. The most natural form of the trial wave function has been single Slater determinants or their linear combinations. More sophisticated forms, for example, with the inclusion of a Jastrow factor or other explicit correlations, have been challenging to use and their implementation is often assumed to require a quantum computer. In this work, we demonstrate that a large class of correlated wave functions, written in the general form of multi-dimensional integrals over hidden or auxiliary variables times Slater determinants, can be implemented as trial wave function by coupling the random walkers to a generalized Metropolis sampling. We discuss the fidelity of AFQMC with stochastically sampled trial wave functions, which are relevant to both quantum and classical algorithms. We illustrate the method and show that an efficient implementation can be achieved which preserves the low-polynomial computational scaling of AFQMC. We test our method in molecules under bond stretching and in transition metal diatomics. Significant improvements are seen in both accuracy and efficiency over typical trial wave functions, and the method yields total ground-state energies systematically within chemical accuracy. The method can be useful for incorporating other advanced wave functions, for example, neural quantum state wave functions optimized from machine learning techniques, or for other forms of fermion quantum Monte Carlo.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Transport Gaps of Fractional Quantum Hall Phases in Graphene Landau Levels are Induced by Spin-Valley Entangled Ground States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jincheng An, Ajit C. Balram, Udit Khanna, Ganpathy Murthy</p>
            <p>We evaluate the transport gaps in the most prominent fractional quantum Hall states in the $\mathbf{n}{=}0$ and $\mathbf{n}{=}1$ Landau Levels of graphene, accounting for the Coulomb interaction, lattice-scale anisotropies, and one-body terms. We find that the fractional phases in the $\mathbf{n}{=}0$ Landau level are bond-ordered, while those in the $\mathbf{n}{=}1$ Landau level are spin-valley entangled. This resolves a long-standing experimental puzzle [Amet, $\textit{et al.}$, Nat. Comm. $\mathbf{6}$, 5838 (2015)] of the contrasting Zeeman dependence of the transport gaps in the two Landau levels. The spin-valley entangled phases host gapless Goldstone modes that can be probed via bulk thermal transport measurements. As a byproduct of our computations, we place strong constraints on the values of the microscopic anisotropic couplings such that these are consistent with all known experimental results.</p>

            <p>The rapid development of computational materials science powered by machine learning (ML) is gradually leading to solutions to several previously intractable scientific problems. One of the most prominent is machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which expedites the study of dynamical methods for large-scale systems. However, a promising field, high-entropy (HE) solid-state electrolytes (SEs) remain constrained by trial-and-error paradigms, lacking systematic computational strategies to address their huge and high-dimensional composition space. In this work, we establish a dual-stage ML framework that combines fine-tuned MLIPs with interpretable feature-property mapping to accelerate the high-entropy SEs discovery. Using Li$_3$Zr$_2$Si$_2$PO$_{12}$ (LZSP) as a prototype, the fine-tuned CHGNet-based relaxation provides atomic structure for each configuration, the structure features - mean squared displacement (SF-MSD) model predicts the ionic transport properties and identifies critical descriptors. The theoretical studies indicate that the framework can satisfy the multiple requirements including computational efficiency, generalization reliability and prediction accuracy. One of the most promising element combinations in the quinary HE-LZSP space containing 4575 compositions is identified with a high ionic conductivity of 4.53 mS/cm as an application example. The framework contains generalizability and extensibility to other SE families.</p>

            <p>The combination of superconductivity and magnetic textures represents a promising approach to explore unconventional superconducting phenomena, including new correlated and topological phases. Van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged in this context as a versatile platform to explore the interplay between these two competing orders. Here, we report on individual NbSe2/NiPS3/NbSe2 vdW Josephson junctions behaving as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which we attribute to the interplay between the superconductivity of NbSe2 and the spin texture of the vdW antiferromagnetic insulator NiPS3. The SQUID behavior, which persists for in-plane magnetic fields of at least 6 T, is the result of interference between localized transport channels that form in two separate regions of the sample. Microscopic modeling of the antiferromagnet insulator/superconductor (AFI/S) interface reveals the formation of localized states at the edges of the junction that can lead to localized channels that dominate the transport. Our findings highlight the potential of vdW superconducting heterostructures with AFs as platforms for engineering and probing novel superconducting phenomena, and they establish a new route for lithographic-free SQUIDs that operate in high magnetic fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Hao Xia, Yi-Peng Gao, Zhao-Yang Dong, Jian-Xin Li</p>
            <p>The search for Kitaev quantum spin liquids (Kitaev-QSLs) in real materials has mainly focused on $4d$- and $5d$-electron honeycomb systems. A recent experimental study on the $4f^5$ honeycomb iodide $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ reported the absence of long-range magnetic order down to $0.1\ \text{K}$, suggesting a possible Kitaev-QSL phase. Motivated by the interplay between the complex exchange processes inherent to the $4f^5$ multi-electron configuration and the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the iodine ligands, we systematically investigate the effective exchange interactions in $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ using the strong coupling expansion method. Our findings reveal that bond-dependent SOCs (bond-SOCs), extracted from relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, significantly enhance the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev interaction, driving the system close to the AFM Kitaev point. A microscopic analysis based on the Slater-Koster approach further indicates that the strong SOC of the iodine ligands (ligand-SOC) is the origin of bond-SOCs and plays a pivotal role in mediating the superexchange processes. Additionally, we identify a spin-flop transition induced by the bond-SOCs, where the enhanced AFM Kitaev interactions shift the AFM order from the out-of-plane $[1, 1, 1]$-direction to an in-plane orientation, breaking the $C_3$ rotational symmetry. Linear spin-wave theory (LSWT) further predicts the emergence of gapless modes following the spin-flop transition, indicating enhanced fluctuations and increased instability near the AFM Kitaev point. Our results highlight the crucial role of strong ligand-SOC in stabilizing the dominant AFM Kitaev interactions in $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ and provide valuable insights for discovering new $f$-electron Kitaev-QSL candidates.</p>

These materials host odd-parity terms in their band dispersion, leading to asymmetric energy bands and enabling responses such as the magnetopiezoelectric effect, nonreciprocal conductivity, and photocurrent generation. In addition, they may support a nonlinear spin Hall effect without spin-orbit coupling, offering an efficient route to spin current generation. We identify 23 candidate AFM1 materials by combining artificial intelligence, density functional theory (DFT), and symmetry analysis. Using a graph neural network model and incorporating AFM1-specific symmetry constraints, we screen Materials Project compounds for high-probability AFM1 candidates. DFT calculations show that AFM1 has the lowest energy among the tested magnetic configurations in 23 candidate materials. These include 3 experimentally verified AFM1 materials, 10 synthesized compounds with unknown magnetic structures, and 10 that are not yet synthesized.</p>

            <p>We consider a slow elastic string with Klein-Gordon dynamics coupled to a bath of run-and-tumble particles. We derive and solve the induced Langevin-Klein-Gordon string dynamics with explicit expressions for the streaming term, friction coefficient, and noise variance. These parameters are computed exactly in a weak coupling expansion. The induced friction is a sum of two terms: one entropic, proportional to the noise variance as in the Einstein relation for a thermal equilibrium bath, and a frenetic contribution that can take both signs. The frenetic part wins for higher bath persistence, making the total friction negative, and hence creating a wave instability akin to inverse Landau damping; the wave acceleration decreases again when the propulsion speed of the active particles gets too high.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takanari Yasuia, Kazuya Nakayama</p>
            <p>The optical responses for UV to NIR and muti-directional photo current have been found on Au (metal) on n-Si device. The unique phenomena have been unresolved since the first sample fabricated in 2007. The self organized sub-micron metal with various crystal faces was supposed to activate as an optical wave guide into Si surface. This, however, is insufficient to explain the unique features above. Thus, for more deep analysis, returning to consider the Si-band structure, indirect/direct transitions of inter conduction bands: X-W, X-K and {\Gamma}-L in the 1st Brillouin Zone/Van Hove singularity at L point, synchronizing with scattering, successfully give these characteristics a reasonable explanation. The calculation of the quantum efficiency between X-W and X-K agreed with those sensitivity for visible region (1.1 to 2.0 eV), the doping process well simulates it for NIR (0.6 to 1.0 eV). Doping electrons (~10^18/cm3) are filled up the zero-gap at around X of a reciprocal lattice point. This is why a lower limit of 0.6 eV was arisen in the sensitivity measurement. When the carrier scattering model was applied to the inter band (X-W, X-K and {\Gamma}-L) transitions, the reasonable interpretation was obtained for the directional dependence of photo-currents with UV (3.4 eV) and Visible (3.1 and 1.9 eV) excitation. Band to band scatterings assist to extend the available optical range and increase variety of directional responses. Utilizing this principle for some indirect transition semiconductors, it will be able to open the new frontier in photo-conversion system, where it will be released from those band gaps and directivity limitations.</p>

            <h2>Ubiquity of rotational symmetry breaking in superconducting films, from Fe(Te,Se)/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ to Nb, and the effect of measurement geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debarghya Mallick, Hee Taek Yi, Xiaoyu Yuan, Seongshik Oh</p>
            <p>FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ heterostructure is a promising new platform in the journey toward topological quantum computation, considering that first, FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ is itself known to be a topological superconductor (TSC) and second, the heterostructure has topological interface states that can be proximitized into TSC even if FTS fails to become TSC on its own. Here, we show that this system exhibits quasi-2D superconductivity, and utilizing the standard in-plane magneto-transport measurements, we discover two-fold anisotropy (a.k.a nematicity) in R$_{xx}$ and I$_c$ measurement, even though the system exhibits globally 12-fold symmetry. Then, we carried out similar measurements on a polycrystalline niobium (Nb) thin film, a well-known s-wave elemental superconductor, and found a similar two-fold symmetry even for this Nb system. This implies either that nematic behavior is ubiquitous or that the in-plane magneto-transport measurement scheme routinely used to detect nematicity is not a reliable method to probe nematicity. We show that the angle-dependent response of vortices in the superconducting regime to the magnetic Lorentz force is very likely the main cause behind the ubiquitous nematic behaviors of this measurement scheme. In other words, this measurement scheme is intrinsically two-fold, and is therefore not suitable to detect the nematicity. Accordingly, all the previous reports of nematicity based on similar measurement practices, reported on various samples, including thin films, bulk crystals, and exfoliated flakes, need to be reinterpreted.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the relationship between categorical entropy and von Neumann entropy of quantum lattices. We begin by studying the von Neumann entropy, proving that the average von Neumann entropy per site converges to the logarithm of an algebraic integer in the low-temperature and thermodynamic limits. Next, we turn to categorical entropy. Given an endofunctor of a saturated A-infinity-category, we construct a corresponding lattice model, through which the categorical entropy can be understood in terms of the information encoded in the model. Finally, by introducing a gauged lattice framework, we unify these two notions of entropy. This unification leads naturally to a sufficient condition for a conjectural algebraicity property of categorical entropy, suggesting a deeper structural connection between A-infinity-categories and statistical mechanics.</p>

            <p>A model that merges the Potts, cubic, and clock models is studied in spatial dimension d=3 by renormalization-group theory. Effective vacancies are included in the renormalization-group initial conditions. In the global phase diagram, 5 different ordered phases, namely ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, antiferrimagnetic, axial, and a disordered phase are found, separated by first- and second-order phase boundaries. 8 different phase diagram cross-sections occur. When the effective vacancies are suppressed, the global spinodal phase diagram is found: All disordering phase transitions become second order, the disordered phase recedes, and 17 different phase diagram cross-sections occur, spinodality thus much enriching ordering behavior. In the spinodal phase diagram, the ferrimagnetic and antiferrimagnetic phases have reentrance. The employed renormalization group transformation is exact on the d=3 dimensional hierarchical model and Migdal-Kadanoff approximate on the cubic lattice.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductors show promise for atomically thin flexible and transparent optoelectronic devices in future this http URL, developing high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials is impeded by two key challenges, the high contact resistance at the 2D semiconductors-metal interface and the limited effective doping strategies. Here, we present a novel approach to overcome these challenges using self-propagating liquid Fields metal, a eutectic alloy with a low melting point of approximately 62 C. By modifying pre-patterned electrodes on WSe2 FETs through the deposition of Fields metal onto contact pad edges followed by vacuum annealing, we create new semimetal electrodes that seamlessly incorporate the liquid metal into 2D semiconductors. This integration preserves the original electrode architecture while transforming to semimetal compositions of Fields metal such as Bi, In, and Sn modifies the work functions to 2D semiconductors, resulting in reduced contact resistance without inducing Fermi-level pinning and charge carrier mobilities. Our method enhances the electrical performance of 2D devices and opens new avenues for designing high-resolution liquid metal circuits suitable for stretchable, flexible, and wearable 2D semiconductor applications.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a learning framework for Three-Directional Associative Memory (TAM) models, extending the classical Hebbian paradigm to both supervised and unsupervised protocols within an hetero-associative setting. These neural networks consist of three interconnected layers of binary neurons interacting via generalized Hebbian synaptic couplings that allow learning, storage and retrieval of structured triplets of patterns. By relying upon glassy statistical mechanical techniques (mainly replica theory and Guerra interpolation), we analyze the emergent computational properties of these networks, at work with random (Rademacher) datasets and at the replica-symmetric level of description: we obtain a set of self-consistency equations for the order parameters that quantify the critical dataset sizes (i.e. their thresholds for learning) and describe the retrieval performance of these networks, highlighting the differences between supervised and unsupervised protocols. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness of the captured picture about TAMs also at work with structured datasets. In particular, this study provides insights into the cooperative interplay of layers, beyond that of the neurons within the layers, with potential implications for optimal design of artificial neural network architectures.</p>

            <p>In biology, ligand mediated transitions (LMT), where the binding of a molecular ligand onto the binding site of a receptor molecule leads to a well-defined change in the conformation of the receptor, are often referred to as 'the second secret of life'. Sharp, cooperative transitions arise in many biological cases, while examples of synthetic cooperative systems are rare. This is because well-defined conformational states are hard to 'program' into a molecular design. Here, we impose an external constraint in the form of two immiscible liquids that effectively define and limit the available conformational states of two different synthetic and relatively simple macromolecules. We show that the mechanism of the observed cooperative transitions with ligand concentration is the coupling of ligand binding and conformation, similar to more complex biological systems. The systems studied are: (1) Hydrophobic polyelectrolytes (HPE), which are (bio) polymers that consist of hydrophobic as well as ionizable (proton and hydroxyl ligand-binding) functional groups. (2) Oligomeric metal chelators (OMC), which are oligomers composed of metal ion chelating repeating groups that are able to bind metal ions (considered as the 'ligands'), resulting in gel-like networks of oligomers crosslinked by coordinated metal ions. We find that in HPE, interactions between ligands and individual macromolecules explain the observed cooperative transitions. For OMC, coordinated bonds significantly enhance the degree of cooperativity, compared to HPE.</p>

            <p>Understanding carrier dynamics in photoexcited metal-halide perovskites is key for optoelectronic devices such as solar cells (low carrier densities) and lasers (high carrier densities). Trapping processes at low carrier densities and many-body recombination at high densities can significantly alter the dynamics of photoexcited carriers. Combining optical-pump/THz probe and transient absorption spectroscopy we examine carrier responses over a wide density range (10^14-10^19 cm-3) and temperatures (78-315K) in the prototypical methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. At densities below ~10^15 cm-3 (room temperature, sunlight conditions), fast carrier trapping at shallow trap states occurs within a few picoseconds. As excited carrier densities increase, trapping saturates, and the carrier response stabilizes, lasting up to hundreds of picoseconds at densities around ~10^17 cm-3. Above 10^18 cm-3 a Mott transition sets in: overlapping polaron wavefunctions lead to ultrafast annihilation through an Auger recombination process occurring over a few picoseconds. We map out trap-dominated, direct recombination-dominated, and Mott-dominated density regimes from 78-315 K, ultimately enabling the construction of an electronic phase diagram. These findings clarify carrier behavior across operational conditions, aiding material optimization for optoelectronics operating in the low (e.g. photovoltaics) and high (e.g. laser) carrier density regimes.</p>

            <p>The rare-earth triangular-lattice magnet NdMgAl11O19 offers an ideal platform for examining the interplay of crystal electric field effects, geometric frustration, and weak exchange interactions. Using high-quality single crystals, we measured magnetic susceptibility and magnetization down to 1.8 K, while specific heat was measured down to 45 mK. The system exhibits uniaxial anisotropy along the c-axis, with a ground-state Kramers doublet. A Curie-Weiss temperature of -0.38 K indicates weak antiferromagnetic interactions, while a specific heat anomaly at 81 mK suggests weak magnetic correlations with no long-range magnetic order. The absence of long-range magnetic order down to 45 mK makes it a very interesting material, which is highly frustrated but weakly correlated. Under external fields, the Zeeman splitting of the ground-state doublet leads to a field-tunable Schottky anomaly, with the specific heat peak shifting to 0.65 meV at 3 T, with g ~ 3.7. A Brillouin function fit to magnetization yields g ~ 3.72, confirming the quasi-paramagnetic nature of NdMgAl11O19.

            <h2>Ab Initio Prediction of Large Thermoelectric Effect in Distorted Heusler Alloy Ti-Fe-Sb Compound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rifky Syariati, Athorn Vora-ud, Fumiyuki Ishii, Tosawat Seetawan</p>
            <p>The thermoelectric figure of merit of the Heusler alloy TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb was investigated by first-principles calculations of lattice thermal conductivity. The electronic thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient are calculated by semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb was found to be thermally and dynamically stable, as confirmed by its phonon dispersion. Additionally, the small phonon band gap between acoustic and optical modes enhances phonon scattering, leading to a low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.703 W/mK at 300 K. Our study also reveals that TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb is a non-magnetic semiconductor. Notably, it demonstrates a significant longitudinal thermoelectric effect, with a Seebeck coefficient of 359.4 $\mu$V/K at 300 K. The combination of low lattice thermal conductivity and a high Seebeck coefficient results in a high thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.88 and 0.91 at 300 K and 500 K, respectively. These findings highlight the considerable potential of TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb as a promising material for thermoelectric device applications.</p>

            <p>We have investigated the structural stability of a binary compound TiSn in the zincblende symmetry. The phonon dispersion studies confirms that, TiSn with a nominal composition of 1:1 can exist in zincblende form. No imaginary frequencies are observed indicating the stable bonding nature of Ti-Sn. From the First principles calculations based on density functional theory, the resulting electronic band structure had revealed that zb-TiSn, is a narrow band gap semiconductor with an energy gap of 0.3 eV with GGA- PBE. The bonding nature is identified as polar covalent, determined from charge density difference plots and Bader charge analysis. Further more, the linear optical properties of zb-TiSn are derived from the Khon-Sham eigenvalues.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel B. B. Almeida, J. E. G. Silva, C. A. S. Almeida</p>
            <p>We study the influence of a localized Gaussian deformation on massless Dirac fermions confined to a two-dimensional curved surface. Both in-plane and out-of-plane displacements are considered within the framework of elasticity theory. These deformations couple to the Dirac spinors via the spin connection and the vielbeins, leading to a position-dependent Fermi velocity and an effective geometric potential. We show that the spin connection contributes an attractive potential centered on the deformation and explore how this influences the fermionic density of states. Analytical and numerical solutions reveal the emergence of bound states near the deformation and demonstrate how the Lamé coefficients affect curvature and state localization. Upon introducing an external magnetic field, the effective potential becomes confining at large distances, producing localized Landau levels that concentrate near the deformation. A geometric Aharonov-Bohm phase is identified through the spinor holonomy. These results contribute to the understanding of strain-induced electronic effects in Dirac materials, such as graphene.</p>

            <p>G-type antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ is shown to be an altermagnet. We present the band structure using an unconventional scheme designed to highlight the distinctive spin splitting which is characteristic of altermagnets. We define and show plots of the spin-splitting function in reciprocal space. We show that the nodal surfaces of the spin-splitting function that follow from symmetry can be classified into two types, which we call symmetry-enforced and continuity-enforced. We describe the spin-splitting function with a simple parametrization in a basis of symmetry-adapted plane waves. Using group-theory analysis based on irreducible representations of the crystallographic Laue group, we confirm that the altermagnetism of G-type BiFeO$_3$ is $g$-wave and present a complete classification table for the general three-dimensional case. Finally, we discuss the effect of ferroelectric switching on the altermagnetic order, and identify three classes of ferroelectric altermagnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. X. Zheng, T. S. Chan, E. H. van Brummelen, J. H. Snoeijer</p>
            <p>The deposition of droplets onto a swollen polymer network induces the formation of a wetting ridge at the contact line. Current models typically consider either viscoelastic effects or poroelastic effects, while polymeric gels often exhibit both properties. In this study, we investigate the growth of the wetting ridge using a comprehensive large deformation theory that integrates both dissipative mechanisms - viscoelasticity and poroelasticity. In the purely poroelastic case, following an initial instantaneous incompressible deformation, the growth dynamics exhibit scale-free behavior, independent of the elastocapillary length or system size. A boundary layer of solvent imbibition between the solid surface (in contact with the reservoir) and the region of minimal chemical potential is created. At later times, the ridge equilibrates on the diffusion timescale given by the elastocapillary length. When viscoelastic properties are incorporated, our findings show that, during the early stages (prior to the viscoelastic relaxation timescale), viscoelastic effects dominate the growth dynamics of the ridge and solvent transport is significantly suppressed. Beyond the relaxation time, the late-time dynamics closely resemble those of the purely poroelastic case. These findings are discussed in light of recent experiments, showing how our approach offers a new interpretation framework for wetting of polymer networks of increasing complexity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Bisswanger, Anne Schmidt, Frank Volmer, Christoph Stampfer, Bernd Beschoten</p>
            <p>A spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spins in bilayer graphene (BLG) can be achieved by spin-orbit proximity coupling of graphene to transition metal dichalcogenides. This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.</p>

            <p>Tobermorite and Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) systems are indispensable cement materials but still lack a satisfactory interatomic potential with both high accuracy and high computational efficiency for better understanding their mechanical performance. Here, we develop a Neuroevolution Machine Learning Potential (NEP) with Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark hybrid framework for tobermorite and C-S-H systems, which conveys unprecedented efficiency in molecular dynamics simulations with substantially reduced training datasets. Our NEP model achieves prediction accuracy comparable to DFT calculations using just around 300 training structures, significantly fewer than other existing machine learning potentials trained for tobermorite. Critically, the GPU-accelerated NEP computations enable scalable simulations of large tobermorite systems, reaching several thousand atoms per GPU card with high efficiency. We demonstrate the NEP's versatility by accurately predicting mechanical properties, phonon density of states, and thermal conductivity of tobermorite. Furthermore, we extend the NEP application to large-scale simulations of amorphous C-S-H, highlighting its potential for comprehensive analysis of structural and mechanical behaviors under various realistic conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Arakawa, Sachio Komori, Tomoyasu Taniyama</p>
            <p>Magnetic properties of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) are highly sensitive to various factors such as the Sr doping level $x$, lattice strain, and oxygen stoichiometry due to the strongly correlated nature of $3d$ electrons. For the development of energy-efficient spintronic devices with ultra-low magnetic damping of LSMO, a thorough understanding of its complex magnetization dynamics is of great importance. In this work, we have measured ferromagnetic resonance of LSMO thin films on Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ (Nb-STO) substrates over a wide temperature and frequency range and observed an anomalous increase in the Gilbert damping constant and a decrease in the effective saturation magnetization at temperatures below 100 K. The anomalies become more pronounced as the LSMO thickness decreases while they are not observed for LSMO on (LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$)$_{0.7}$ substrates with relatively small epitaxial strain. The results suggest that the epitaxial strain-induced magnetically dead layer at the LSMO/Nb-STO interface acts as a spin sink and leads to the anomalies in the magnetization dynamics.</p>

            <p>Unconventional superconductivity typically emerges out of a strongly correlated normal state, manifesting as a Fermi liquid with highly enhanced effective mass or a strange metal with $T$-linear resistivity in the zero-temperature limit. In Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates $R_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, superconductivity with a critical temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) exceeding 80 and 40 K has been respectively realised in bulk crystals under high pressure and thin films under compressive strain. These advancements create new materials platforms to study the nature of high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity, calling for the characterisation of fundamental normal-state and superconducting parameters therein. Here we report detailed magnetotransport experiments on superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ (LPNO) thin films under pulsed magnetic fields up to 64 T and access the normal-state behaviour over a wide temperature range between 1.5 and 300 K. We find that the normal state of LPNO exhibits the hallmarks of Fermi liquid transport, including $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity and Hall angle, and $H^2$ magnetoresistance obeying Kohler scaling. Using the empirical Kadowaki-Woods ratio relating the transport coefficient and electronic specific heat, we estimate a quasiparticle effective mass $m^*/m_e \simeq 10$ in PLNO, thereby revealing the highly renormalized Fermi liquid state which hosts the high-temperature nickelate superconductivity. Our results demonstrate that LPNO follows the same $T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm F}^*$ scaling observed across a wide variety of strongly correlated superconductors and provide crucial constraints for a viable model for superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p>Anion-conductive polymer membranes have attracted considerable attention as solid electrolytes for alkaline fuel cells and electrolysis cells. Their hydroxide ion conductivity varies depending on factors such as the type and distribution of quaternary ammonium groups, as well as the structure and connectivity of hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. In particular, the size and connectivity of hydrophilic domains significantly influence the mobility of hydroxide ions; however, this relationship has remained largely qualitative. In this study, we calculated the number of key constituent elements in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic units based on the copolymer composition, and investigated their relationship with hydroxide ion conductivity by using Bayesian sparse modeling. As a result, we successfully identified composition-derived features that are critical for accurately predicting hydroxide ion conductivity.</p>

            <h2>Thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au metallic alloys determined by resonant scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kacper Pryga, Bartlomiej Wiendlocha</p>
            <p>This work presents a theoretical study of the electronic structure and transport properties of Ni-Au alloys, recently identified as excellent thermoelectric metals with a power factor significantly exceeding that of conventional semiconductor thermoelectrics. Using first-principles calculations based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the coherent-potential approximation (KKR-CPA) and the Kubo-Greenwood formalism, we demonstrate the key role of resonant scattering in determining the thermoelectric properties of these alloys. This is supported by calculated densities of states, Bloch spectral functions, electrical conductivity, and thermopower. Alloying Ni with Au not only induces resonant scattering but also leads to the formation of a flat band below the Fermi level. The combination of these two features results in high thermopower, arising from a transition between resonant and weak scattering regimes near the Fermi level. Our findings are further compared with analogous calculations for constantan, a Ni-Cu alloy long regarded as a reference thermoelectric metal. We show that differences between the Ni-Au and Ni-Cu systems explain why Ni-Au exhibits nearly twice the thermopower of Ni-Cu. Finally, we simulate the effect of lattice parameter variation on the thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au and suggest that this is a promising pathway for further enhancement, for example through additional alloying or layer deposition.</p>

            <p>We study quantum coherence and phase transitions in a finite-size one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model using exact numerical diagonalization. The system is investigated under the competing effects of thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and a disorder term. We compute several observables, including the condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of quantum coherence, to characterize the transition from the Mott insulator to the superfluid phase. In the standard Bose-Hubbard model, ground-state properties exhibit signatures of a quantum phase transition under open boundary conditions. While finite-size effects preclude an exact realization of the thermodynamic transition, our findings serve as indicators of the underlying quantum critical behavior of the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. At finite temperatures, this critical point shifts to a smooth crossover, reflecting the suppression of long-range coherence typical of larger systems. A nonzero Stark potential delays this crossover, promoting localization and the formation of non-superfluid condensates. In contrast, thermal fluctuations can induce unexpected coherence through fluctuation-driven tunneling. Disorder disrupts superfluidity but preserves local coherence, with thermal states exhibiting an enhanced $\ell_1$-norm of coherence within the Bose glass regime. Our results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature jointly reshape the coherence landscape, and offer valuable insights for quantum simulation and the characterization of quantum phases in strongly correlated systems. Non-ergodic behavior is observed in the clean system where the mean gap ratio stays below Poisson and Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) values. With a Stark potential, level statistics shift from Poisson-like to near-GOE as tunneling increases, which indicates a crossover to semi-ergodic dynamics.</p>

            <p>We show how a Fujita-Miyazawa-type three-body force emerges among three impurity atoms immersed in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate near an interspecies Feshbach resonance. As a result of thermal average over excitations in the medium and impurities as well as expansion with respect to the impurity-medium and Feshbach resonance couplings, two superfluid phonons and a closed channel resonance play a role in producing an effective three-body force, as in the original three-nucleon case in which two pions and a $\Delta$ resonance are involved. The proposed Fujita-Miyazawa-type three-body force can be enhanced by tuning the closed-channel energy level via an external magnetic field, and moreover, its strength can be confirmed experimentally by measuring the impurity equation of state. Our result gives a new insight into an analogy between atomic polarons and nuclear few-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Extreme value statistics in a continuous time branching process: a pedagogical primer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satya N. Majumdar, Alberto Rosso</p>
            <p>We study a continuous time branching process where an individual splits into two daughters with rate b and dies with rate a, starting from a single individual at t=0. We show that the model can be mapped exactly to a random walk problem where the population size N(t) performs a random walk on a positive semi-infinite lattice. The hopping rate of this random walker out of a site labelled n is proportional to n, i.e., the walker gets more and more `agitated' as it moves further and further away from the origin--we call this an `agitated random walk' (ARW). We demonstrate that this random walk problem is particularly suitable to obtain exact explicit results on the extreme value statistics, namely, on the distribution of the maximal population size M(t)= \max_{0\tau\le t}[N(\tau)] up to time t. This extreme value distribution displays markedly different behaviors in the three phases: (i) subcritical (b<a) (ii) critical (b=a) and (iii) supercritical (b>a). In the subcritical and critical phases , Q(L,t) becomes independent of time t for large t and the stationary distribution Q(L, \infty) decays to zero with increasing L, respectively exponentially (subcritical) and algebraically (critical). For finite but large t, the distribution at the critical point exhibits a scaling form Q(L,t)\sim f_c(L/{at})/L^2 where the scaling function f_c(z) has a nontrivial shape that we compute analytically. In the supercritical phase, the distribution Q(L,t) has a `fluid' part that becomes independent of t for large t and a `condensate' part (a delta peak centered at e^{(b-a)t}) which gets disconnected from the `fluid' part and moves rapidly to \infty as time increases. We also verify our analytical predictions via numerical simulations finding excellent agreement.</p>

            <p>Measurements of the thermal conductance of single-molecule junctions have recently been reported for the first time. It is presently unclear, how much the heat transport can be controlled through molecule-internal effects. The search for molecules with lowest and highest thermal conductance is complicated by the gigantic chemical space. Here we describe a systematic search for molecules with a low or a high phononic thermal conductance using a genetic algorithm. Beyond individual structures of well performing molecules, delivered by the genetic algorithm, we analyze patterns and identify the different physical and chemical mechanisms to suppress or enhance phonon heat flow. In detail, mechanisms revealed to reduce phonon transport are related to the choice of terminal linker blocks, substituents and corresponding mass disorder or destructive interference, meta couplings and molecule-internal twist. For a high thermal conductance, the molecules should instead be rather uniform and chain-like. The identified mechanisms are systematically analyzed at different levels of theory, and their significance is classified. Our findings are expected to be important for the emerging field of molecular phononics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey</p>
            <p>The anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) is a key transport property in magnetic and topological materials, arising from the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) of electronic bands. It offers deep insight into the underlying topology and thermoelectric behavior. While Wannier interpolation have become popular for calculating ANC due to their computational efficiency, their accuracy critically depends on the quality of the Wannierization, which can be challenging for entangled bands or materials with complex band crossings. These limitations highlight the need for a direct first-principles approach to reliably compute ANC from ab-initio electronic structures. Here, we present a C++ based code named C-BerryANC that calculates $\boldsymbol\Omega$-dependent ANC by directly using the eigenvalues and momentum-matrices obtained from DFT calculations. Presently, the code is interfaced with WIEN2k package which uses all-electron approach and full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) based method. For efficiently handling dense k-mesh, calculation of $\boldsymbol\Omega$ is made parallel over k-points using the OpenMP method. Additionally, the code stores band-resolved components of $\boldsymbol\Omega$ in binary files thereby reducing the memory occupancy and providing fast post-process option to compute ANC for any range of chemical potential and temperature values. Also, as compilation of C++ modules produce executable files which are in machine level language, computational speed of C-BerryANC is very fast. The code is benchmarked over some well-known materials exhibiting ANC. These includes- Pd, Fe$_3$Al & Co$_2$FeAl. The obtained values of ANC is found to in good agreement with the previously reported data. This highlights the accuracy, efficieny and reliability of the C-BerryANC code.</p>

            <p>We present a stochastic model of memory-driven random walks on complex networks, where a single walker explores the network through a combination of local random walks and memory-based resetting. The walker either moves to a neighboring node or resets to a previously visited node with a probability proportional to the visitation this http URL node in the network accumulates stress with every visit, and once the accumulated stress exceeds a threshold, the node topples, redistributing the stress to its neighbors. This redistribution can trigger cascading avalanches across the network. We demonstrate that this simple memory-driven mechanism, combined with local stress dynamics, leads to the emergence of self-organized criticality (SOC) across various network topologies, including Small-World and BA this http URL resulting avalanche size distributions follow power-law statistics, with exponents that are consistent with those found in classical SOC systems. Our model requires no fine-tuning of parameters to achieve criticality and offers a novel insight into how memory, network structure, and local stress interactions can give rise to emergent critical phenomena.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Ralph Warwick, Pui-Wai Ma, Sergei Lvovich Dudarev</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive ab initio dataset of formation energies and elastic properties of intrinsic point defects across all the transition and rare earth hexagonal close packed (hcp) metals, as well as metalloid elements with hcp crystal structure. Point defect properties appear weakly correlated with the c/a ratio of the hcp lattice. Instead, it is the position of an element in the Periodic Table that primarily defines the relaxation volume tensor, elastic dipole tensor and formation energy of a point defect. This suggests that the local variations in the electronic structure and interatomic bonding at the core of a defect dominate its properties, as opposed to long-range elastic deformations. Across all the metals, we find that the relaxation volumes of vacancies and self-interstitial defects are correlated with atomic volumes, with values of -0.35 and 1.46 atomic volumes for a vacancy and a self-interstitial defect, respectively, providing a universally good approximation independent of the crystal structure. This study complements and completes the existing point defect databases spanning body-centred cubic and face-centred cubic metals.</p>

            <p>Superlattices presenting a spatial modulation of the elastic properties appear as a main tool to reach the THz regime in nanoacoustic devices. The exploration of alternative materials with multifunctional properties remains a fertile domain of research. In this work, we study the structural, magnetic, and acoustic characteristics of nanometric superlattices made of Pt/Co. The samples present a well defined periodicity, as determined by X-ray reflectometry, whereas scanning transmission electron microscopy with local compositional analysis reveals that the superlattices present a modulation in composition instead of sharp interfaces. The policrystalline nature of the superlattices is evidenced both by X ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Magnetization measurements show a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for the higher Co concentrations. Picosecond acoustic experiments evidence that the studied samples support short-lived acoustic modes up to 900 GHz, and up to 7 acoustic echoes at lower this http URL are promising results for the development of magnetoacoustic devices working at ultrahigh frequencies.</p>

            <p>We explore the impact of spin disorder associated with structural defects on antiferromagnetic magnon transport by probing the spin-flop transition of Cr2O3 using spin Seebeck effect measurements. By fabricating homoepitaxial Cr2O3 films grown on smooth Cr2O3 crystals, we systematically vary the thickness of the films in which the presence of point defects modulates the spin-flop transition field. We find that magnon propagation through the film is entirely suppressed for film thickness greater than 3 nm, revealing the pivotal role of disorder in governing antiferromagnetic magnon transport.</p>

            <h2>Driven Probe Particle Dynamics in a Bubble Forming System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt</p>
            <p>We numerically examine the dynamics of a probe particle driven at a constant force through an assembly of particles with competing long-range repulsion and short-range attraction that forms a bubble or stripe state. In the bubble regime, we identify several distinct types of motion, including an elastic or pinned regime where the probe particle remains inside a bubble and drags all other bubbles with it. There is also a plastic bubble phase where the bubble in which the probe particle is trapped is able to move past the adjacent bubbles. At larger drives, there is a breakthrough regime where the probe particle jumps from bubble to bubble, and in some cases, can induce correlated rotations or plastic rearrangements of the particles within the bubbles. At the highest drives, the probe particle moves sufficiently rapidly that the background particles undergo only small distortions. The distinctive dynamic flow states and the transitions between them are accompanied by signatures in the effective drag on the driven particle, jumps in the velocity-force curves, and changes in the time-dependent velocity fluctuations. We map the dynamic phase diagram for this system for varied interaction lengths, bubble sizes, and densities.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuations in DNA Packing Density Drive the Spatial Segregation between Euchromatin and Heterochromatin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luming Meng, Boping Liu, Qiong Luo</p>
            <p>In the crowded eukaryotic nucleus, euchromatin and heterochromatin segregate into distinct compartments, a phenomenon often attributed to homotypic interactions mediated by liquid liquid phase separation of chromatin associated proteins. Here, we revisit genome compartmentalization by examining the role of in vivo DNA packing density fluctuations driven by ATP dependent chromatin remodelers. Leveraging DNA accessibility data, we develop a polymer based model that captures these fluctuations and successfully reproduces genome wide compartment patterns observed in HiC data, without invoking homotypic interactions. Further analysis reveals that density fluctuations in a crowded nuclear environment elevate the system energy, while euchromatin heterochromatin segregation facilitates energy dissipation, offering a thermodynamic advantage for spontaneous compartment formation. These findings suggest that euchromatin heterochromatin segregation may arise through a non equilibrium, self organizing process, providing new insights into genome organization.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional multi-layer materials with an induced moiré pattern, either due to strain or relative twist between layers, provide a versatile platform for exploring strongly correlated and topological electronic phenomena. While these systems offer unprecedented tunability, their theoretical description remains challenging due to their complex atomic structures and large unit cells. A notable example is twisted bilayer graphene, where even the relevant symmetry group remains unsettled despite its critical role in constructing effective theories. Here, we focus on twisted bilayer graphene and use a combination of analytical methods, molecular dynamics simulations, and first-principles calculations to show that twisted atomic configurations with distinct microscopic symmetries converge to a universal interlayer structure that governs the low-energy physics. This emergent universality provides a robust foundation for symmetry-respecting models and offers insight into the role of commensurability in real twisted moiré systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryota Mizuno, Kazuhiko Kuroki, Masayuki Ochi</p>
            <p>Estimating the local two-particle vertex functions, which are crucial for capturing the spatial fluctuation of the effective field beyond the single-site DMFT, is still challenging. In our previous work, we developed a computationally efficient method for estimating the local full-vertex in DMFT, where we can obtain the local two-particle full-vertex from the one-particle self-energy. In this study, we further enhance our method by refining its formulation to be more faithful to the diagrammatic structure of the full-vertex. With this improvement, we can qualitatively reproduce the characteristic frequency structures of the full-vertex obtained by the numerically exact methods. In particular, the improved version of the simplified full-vertex captures a sharp value change in the cross structure.</p>

            <p>Knight shifts along the $b$ and $c$ axes ($K_b$ and $K_c$) at two crystallographically distinct Te sites were measured down to 70 mK using $^{125}$Te nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on an ultraclean UTe$_2$ single crystal with a superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ = 2.1 K. This was carried out to determine the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector components, which are the order parameter in the spin-triplet pairing. Although the decrease in $K_b$ and $K_c$ is comparable to the theoretical estimation of the SC diamagnetic shielding effect, it is confirmed, by taking the difference between two Knight shifts at the distinct Te sites, that the spin susceptibility along the $b$ and $c$ axes decreases in the SC state. Taking into account the large decrease in $K_a$ in the SC state, we conclude that the $\boldsymbol{d}$ vector has components along all three crystal axes.</p>

            <p>This study utilizes first-principles computational methods to comprehensively analyze the impact of A-site doping on the proton conduction properties of BaHfO$_3$. The goal is to offer theoretical support for the advancement of electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells. Our research has uncovered that BaHfO$_3$ demonstrates promising potential for proton conduction, with a low proton migration barrier of 0.28 eV, suggesting efficient proton conduction can be achieved at lower temperatures. Through A-site doping, particularly with low-valence state ions and the introduction of Ba vacancies, we can effectively decrease the formation energy of oxygen vacancies (Evac), leading to an increase in proton concentration. Additionally, our study reveals that the primary mechanism for proton migration in BaHfO$_3$ is the Grotthuss mechanism rather than the Vehicle mechanism. Examination of the changes in lattice parameters during proton migration indicates that while doping or vacancy control strategies do not alter the mode of H+ migration, they do influence the migration pathway and barrier. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the proton conduction properties of BaHfO$_3$ through A-site doping and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the development of novel, highly efficient Solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte materials.</p>

            <h2>Longitudinal magnetoconductivity in chiral multifold semimetals exemplified by pseudospin-1 nodal points</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We embark on computing the longitudinal magnetoconductivity within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, where an isotropic triple-point semimetal (TSM) is subjected to collinear electric ($\boldsymbol E $) and magnetic ($\boldsymbol B$) fields. Except for the Drude part, the $B$-dependence arises exclusively from topological properties like the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artifact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. It necessitates the consideration of interband scatterings within the same node as well, providing a complex interplay of intraband, interband, intranode, and internode processes. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziyang Yu, Zhejunyu Jin, Qianjun Zheng, Peng Yan</p>
            <p>Phononic frequency combs (PFCs) typically require nonlinear elastic media, limiting their frequency range and stability. Here, we propose a transformative approach to generate PFCs in purely linear elastic media by harnessing the magnon nonlinearities, offering a new paradigm for frequency comb physics. By tuning the magnon-phonon coupling confined in a magnetic disk of a vortex state into the strong coupling regime, we demonstrate an efficient nonlinearity transfer from magnons to phonons. This mechanism is able to produce GHz-range PFCs with comb spacing set by the vortex core's gyration frequency. Full micromagnetic simulations verify our theoretical predictions, confirming robust comb formation at 3.5 GHz with 0.4 GHz spacing. This approach overcomes the sub-MHz constraints of conventional PFCs, enabling applications in high-precision metrology, nanoscale sensing, and quantum technologies. Our findings also deepen the understanding of the nonlinear dynamics in hybrid magnon-phonon systems and provide a versatile platform for exploring frequency combs in diverse physical systems.</p>

In this work, we use first-principles calculations of the free-energy, incorporating both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results reveal a competition between metastable stacking orders of the reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers, which are energetically favored to form exclusively a triangular-hexagonal arrangement, allowing the possibility of competitive different domains and chiral order. Consistent with experimental observations, we find that the $2\times2\times2$ and $2\times2\times4$ modulations are nearly degenerate in free energy, and are abruptly melted into the high-symmetry hexagonal phase around 90 K. The transition is first-order but compatible with a measurable phonon-softening. Remarkably, even if the six-fold and inversion symmetry are intrinsically broken by the out-of-plane stacking, this does not lead to measurable anisotropy in the in-plane conductivity as suggested by measurements.</p>

            <h2>Composition dependent $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ band parameters for wurtzite (Al,Ga)N alloys from density functional theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Kumar Singh, Alvaro Gomez-Iglesias, Stefan Schulz</p>
            <p>UV emitters based on the semiconductor alloy aluminium gallium nitride, (Al,Ga)N, have attracted significant interest in recent years due to their potential for optoelectronic devices. To guide the design of such devices with improved efficiencies, theoretical frameworks based on so-called k.p methods have found widespread application in the literature. Given that k.p models are empirical in nature, parameters such as effective masses or crystal field splitting energies of (Al,Ga)N alloys have to be provided as input from first-principles calculations or experiment. Although these parameters are available for GaN and AlN, detailed information on their composition dependence is sparse. Here, we address this question and provide (Al,Ga)N band parameters for widely used k.p Hamiltonians. We start from density functional theory (DFT) to sample the electronic structure of (Al,Ga)N alloys over the full composition range. The k.p parameters are treated as free parameters to reproduce the DFT data. For GaN and AlN the parameters extracted here agree well with literature values. When turning to the composition dependence of the k.p parameters, our calculations show that most parameters deviate significantly from a linear interpolation of the GaN and AlN values, an approximation widely made in the literature. Moreover, to describe changes in the band parameters with Al content, composition dependent bowing parameters have to be considered for an accurate description of the DFT data. Finally, our analysis also provides initial insight into consequences of the nonlinear composition dependence of the k.p parameters for the electronic structure of (Al,Ga)N alloys. We find that in particular the band ordering is affected by the nonlinear evolution of the crystal field splitting energy with composition, an important aspect for the light polarization characteristics of high Al content (Al,Ga)N alloys.</p>

To reveal the role of angles, we first focus on wedges and obtain the mean boundary local time, its variance, and the asymptotic behavior of its distribution. Moreover, we establish the coupled partial differential equations for higher-order moments. Next, we propose an efficient multi-scale Monte Carlo approach to simulate the boundary local time, as well as the escape duration and position of the associated reaction event on a polygonal boundary. This numerical approach combines the walk-on-spheres algorithm in the bulk with an approximate solution of the escape problem from a sector. We apply it to investigate how the statistics of the boundary local time depends on the geometric complexity of the Koch snowflake. Eventual applications to diffusion-controlled reactions on partially reactive boundaries, including the asymptotic behavior of the survival probability, are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jesus Cañas, Mohamed Yassine, Oliver Ambacher</p>
            <p>The discovery of ferroelectricity in wurtzite nitrides has paved the way for measuring and understanding spontaneous polarization in III-V semiconductors. However, the calculation of polarization effects at heterointerfaces - crucial for numerous electronic and photonic applications - remains a topic of debate. The need for a reference structure to calculate spontaneous polarization has led to discussions over whether to use the zincblende or layered hexagonal structures as the reference for wurtzite crystals. In this work, we argue that the layered hexagonal structure is not only a better reference due to its vanishing formal polarization but also the only physically correct choice for the wurtzite system. This follows from the fact that spontaneous polarization is rigorously defined through the ferroelectric switching. Applying this definition, we extend our analysis to III-V zincblende semiconductors and reveal that their spontaneous polarization is approximately three times larger than that of wurtzite, thereby refuting the longstanding assumption that it is zero. Through this example, we illustrate that spontaneous polarization is not inherently linked to charge density at interfaces.</p>

            <p>In these Lecture Notes we aim at clarifying how soft matter physics, and herein notably statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics, can be engaged to understand and manipulate non-equilibrium systems consisting of numerous (microscopic) constituents that convert (chemical) energy to mechanical energy, or vice versa, and that are known as active matter. Hydrodynamic theory, vitally extended to include (anisotropic) active stress, provides an astonishingly successful scaffold for tackling the problem of spontaneous flow in active nematics, all the way to active turbulence. The laws of physics, nonchalantly tresspassing the border crossing between inanimate particle and living cell, are seen to perform cum laude in describing the bi-directional coupling between division and apoptosis on the one hand and mechanical stress on the other. Fluidization of cellular tissue by cell division is a conceptual leap in this arena. The active behavior of nematic tissues (cell extrusion, multilayer formation, ...) turns out to be controlled by topological defects in the orientational order. Playgrounds by excellence for exhibiting stress-growth coupling are multicellular spheroids serving as model tumors, and cysts used as stem cell factories for cell therapy. Finally, our study of villi and crypts in the intestine furnishes a synthesis of various concepts explored. Cell mechanical pressure and cell layer geometrical curvature turn out to provide the dynamical ingredients which, when coupled to the cell division rate, allow one to develop a physical theory of tissue morphology which hopefully will have practical impact on cancer research.</p>

            <h2>Density-Functional Green Function Theory: Dynamical exchange-correlation field in lieu of self-energy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Aryasetiawan</p>
            <p>The one-particle Green function of a many-electron system is traditionally formulated within the self-energy picture. A different formalism was recently proposed, in which the self-energy is replaced by a dynamical exchange-correlation field, which acts on the Green function locally in both space and time. It was found that there exists a fundamental quantity, referred to as the dynamical exchange-correlation hole, which can be interpreted as effective density fluctuations induced in a many-electron system when a hole or an electron is introduced into the system, as in photoemission and inverse photoemission experiments. The dynamical exchange-correlation potential is simply the Coulomb potential of this exchange-correlation hole, which fulfils a sum rule and an exact constraint, identical to those satisfied by the static exchange-correlation hole in density-functional theory. The proposed formalism has been applied to a number of model systems such as the half-filled one-dimensional Hubbard model, the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, and the single-impurity Anderson model. The dynamical exchange-correlation hole and field of the homogeneous electron gas have also been studied with the view of constructing a density-functional approximation such as the local-density approximation. The availability of simple but accurate approximations for the exchange-correlation potential would circumvent costly computations of the traditional self-energy. The formalism may also provide new perspectives and insights into the many-body problem.</p>

            <p>The interpretation of sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra has been severely limited by the absence of quantitative theoretical predictions for multipole contributions. The previously unknown magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions are determined by the bulk media but appear in all experimental SFG spectra, obscuring the connection between measured spectra and interfacial structure. We present the simulation-based framework that predicts the full set of multipole contributions to the SFG spectrum. This framework also yields depth-resolved spectra, enabling the precise localization of spectroscopic features. Applied to the air-water interface, our approach achieves quantitative agreement with experimental spectra for different polarization combinations in both the bending and stretching regions. Multipole contributions are crucial for correctly interpreting SFG spectra: in the bending band, the electric dipole contribution is of an intensity similar to the magnetic dipole contribution, and both are dominated by the electric quadrupole contribution. In the OH-stretch region, the electric quadrupole contribution is found to be responsible for the mysterious shoulder at 3600 cm$^{-1}$. Crucially, subtracting the multipole contributions isolates the second-order electric dipole susceptibility, which is a quantitative probe for interfacial orientational anisotropy. This electric-dipole susceptibility reveals a pronounced biaxial ordering of water at the air-water interface. By resolving a fundamental limitation of the interpretation of SFG spectroscopy, our framework allows for the detailed extraction of interfacial water ordering from SFG spectra.</p>

            <p>Quaternary mixed-metal M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 chalcohalides are an emerging material class for photovoltaic absorbers that combines the beneficial optoelectronic properties of lead-based halide perovskites with the stability of metal chalcogenides. Inspired by the recent discovery of lead-free mixed-metal chalcohalides materials, we utilized a combination of density functional theory and machine learning to determine compositional trends and chemical design rules in the lead-free and lead-based materials spaces. We explored a total of 54 M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 materials with M(II) = Sn, Pb, M(III) = In, Sb, Bi, Ch = S, Se, Te, and X = Cl, Br, I per phase (Cmcm, Cmc21 , and P21/c). The P21/c phase is the equilibrium phase at low temperatures, followed by Cmc21 and Cmcm. The fundamental band gaps in Cmcm and Cmc21 are smaller than those in P21/c, but direct band gaps are more common in Cmcm and Cmc21. The effective electron masses in P21/c are significantly larger compared to Cmcm and Cmc21, while the effective hole masses are nearly the same across all three phases. Using random forest regression, we found that the two electron acceptor sites (Ch and X) are crucial in shaping the properties of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds. Furthermore, the electron donor sites (M(II) and M(III)) can be used to finetune the material properties to desired applications. These design rules enable precise tailoring of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds for a variety of applications.</p>

            <p>The manipulation of material properties by laser light holds great promise for the development of future technologies. However, the full picture of the electronic response to laser driving remains to be uncovered. We present a novel approach to reveal details of the electron dynamics of laser-dressed materials, which consists of calculating and analysing the time-dependent partial density of states (PDOS) of materials during their interaction with a driving electromagnetic field. We show that the laser-dressed PDOS provides information about the structure of the bonds that form the laser-dressed electron density, analogous to the information that a PDOS can provide about the electron structure in a field-free case. We illustrate how our method can provide insights into the electron dynamics of materials in a site- and orbital-selective manner with calculations for a laser-dressed wurtzite ZnO crystal. Our work provides an analytical tool for the interpretation of subcycle-resolved experiments on laser-dressed materials and for the development of strategies for optical manipulation of material properties.</p>

            <p>Glassy systems reveal a wide variety of generic behaviors inherited from their intrinsically-disordered, non-equilibrium nature. These include universal non-phononic vibrational spectra, and driven phenomena such as thermal and mechanical annealing, yielding transitions and memory formation, all linked to the underlying complex energy landscape of glasses. Yet, a unified theory of such diverse glassy phenomena is currently lacking. Here, we study a recently introduced mean-field model of glasses, shown to reproduce the universal non-phononic vibrational spectra of glasses, under oscillatory driving forces. We show that the driven mean-field model, admitting a Hamiltonian formulation in terms of a collection of random-stiffness anharmonic oscillators with disordered interactions, naturally predicts the salient dynamical phenomena in cyclically deformed glasses. Specifically, it features a yielding transition as a function of the amplitude of the oscillatory driving force, characterized by an absorbing-to-diffusive transition in the system's microscopic trajectories and large-scale hysteresis. The model also reveals dynamic slowing-down from both sides of the transition, as well as mechanical and thermal annealing effects that mirror their glass counterparts. We demonstrate a non-equilibrium ensemble equivalence between the driven post-yielding dynamics at fixed quenched disorder and quenched disorder averages of the non-driven system. Finally, mechanical memory formation is demonstrated, in which memories can be stored in the model and subsequently extracted. Overall, the mean-field model offers a theoretical framework that unifies a broad range of glassy behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion with stochastic resetting on a lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander K. Hartmann, Satya N. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We provide an exact formula for the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to a target at the origin for a single particle diffusing on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic {\em lattice} starting from a fixed initial position $\vec R_0$ and resetting to $\vec R_0$ with a rate $r$. Previously known results in the continuous space are recovered in the scaling limit $r\to 0$, $R_0=|\vec R_0|\to \infty$ with the product $\sqrt{r}\, R_0$ fixed. However, our formula is valid for any $r$ and any $\vec R_0$ that enables us to explore a much wider region of the parameter space that are inaccessible in the continuum limit. For example, we have shown that the MFPT, as a function of $r$ for fixed $\vec R_0$, diverges in the two opposite limits $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ with a unique minimum in between, provided the starting point is not a nearest neighbour of the target. In this case, the MFPT diverges as a power law $\sim r^{\phi}$ as $r\to \infty$, but very interestingly with an exponent $\phi= (|m_1|+|m_2|+\ldots +|m_d|)-1$ that depends on the starting point $\vec R_0= a\, (m_1,m_2,\ldots, m_d)$ where $a$ is the lattice spacing and $m_i$'s are integers. If, on the other hand, the starting point happens to be a nearest neighbour of the target, then the MFPT decreases monotonically with increasing $r$, approaching a universal limiting value $1$ as $r\to \infty$, indicating that the optimal resetting rate in this case is infinity. We provide a simple physical reason and a simple Markov-chain explanation behind this somewhat unexpected universal result. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations on lattices up to $50$ dimensions. Finally, in the absence of a target, we also compute exactly the position distribution of the walker in the nonequlibrium stationary state that also displays interesting lattice effects not captured by the continuum theory.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling hierarchical relaxations in glass formers via dynamic eigenmodes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wensi Sun, Yanshuang Chen, Wencheng Ji, Yi Zhou, Hua Tong, Ke Chen, Xiaosong Chen, Hajime Tanaka, Peng Tan</p>
            <p>Hierarchical dynamics in glass-forming systems span multiple timescales, from fast vibrations to slow structural rearrangements, appearing in both supercooled fluids and glassy states. Understanding how these diverse processes interact across timescales remains a central challenge. Here, by combining direct particle-level observations with a dynamic eigenmode approach that decomposes intermediate-timescale responses into distinct modes, we reveal the microscopic organisation of relaxation dynamics in two-dimensional colloidal systems. We identify five classes of modes characterizing hierarchical dynamics: (i) quasi-elastic modes, (ii) slow-reversible string modes contributing to dynamic heterogeneity, (iii) slow-irreversible string modes leading to flow, (iv) fast-$\beta$ modes with fast-reversible strings, and (v) random noise modes. The emergence of quasi-elastic modes marks the onset of glassy dynamics, while reversible string modes dominate dynamic heterogeneity throughout both supercooled and glassy regimes. Our findings offer a unified microscopic framework for understanding how distinct relaxation processes interconnect across timescales, illuminating the mechanisms driving glass formation.</p>

            <p>Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a promising material for electronic applications due to their easy fabrication and interesting semiconductor properties. Further, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and charging effects, which may lead not only to improved performances but also to devices with novel functionalities. Here, we investigate the electronic transport of CQDs embedded on epoxy polymer. Our samples are coupled to interdigitated electrodes with individually addressable microelectrodes. Remarkably, the current-voltage characteristics show strongly nonlinear regimes at room temperature, ranging from Schottky diode to Coulomb blockade and even negative differential conductance behavior. We propose a master equation theoretical framework which allows us to compute current curves that agree well with the observations. This model emphasizes the importance of interacting dots and electron traps in generating a cohesive picture that encompasses all transport regimes. Overall, our results suggest that CQDs constitute a versatile materials platform for 3D integrated electronic purposes.</p>

            <p>The local environment of Mn atoms in stoichiometric and off-stoichiometric (with Mn excess) Ni-Mn-Ga Heusler alloys was investigated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and interpreted with the help of Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In cubic austenite, the significant amount of structural defects was observed in $^{55}$Mn NMR experiments and interpreted using DFT calculations as individual antisite defects or defects accompanying anti-phase boundaries. The spectrum of non-modulated martensite was similar to that of austenite, albeit with increasing disorder due to excess Mn. In 10M modulated martensite, the main lines were split. The splitting is ascribed to structural modulation and quantitative analysis shows that the amplitude of modulation evolves with temperature and its magnitude is in agreement with diffraction data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederik Vonhoff, Maximilian J. Schilcher, David R. Reichman, David A. Egger</p>
            <p>Predicting and explaining charge carrier transport in halide perovskites is a formidable challenge because of the unusual vibrational and electron-phonon coupling properties of these materials. This study explores charge carrier transport in two prototypical halide perovskite materials, MAPbBr$_3$ and MAPbI$_3$, using a dynamic disorder model. Focusing on the role of real-space transport channels, we analyze temporal orbital occupations to assess the impact of material-specific on-site energy levels and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strengths. Our findings reveal that both on-site energies and SOC magnitude significantly influence the orbital occupation dynamics, thereby affecting charge dispersal and carrier mobility. In particular, energy gaps across on-site levels and the halide SOC strength govern the filling of transport channels over time. This leads us to identify the $pp\pi$ channel as a critical bottleneck for charge transport and to provide insights into the differences between electron and hole transport across the two materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Raßhofer, Simon Bauer, Alexander Ziepke, Ivan Maryshev, Erwin Frey</p>
            <p>The dynamics of phase-separated interfaces shape the behavior of both passive and active condensates. While surface tension in equilibrium systems minimizes interface length, non-equilibrium fluxes can destabilize flat or constantly curved interfaces, giving rise to complex interface morphologies. Starting from a minimal model that couples a conserved, phase-separating species to a self-generated chemical field, we identify the conditions under which interfacial instabilities may emerge. Specifically, we show that non-reciprocal chemotactic interactions induce two distinct types of instabilities: a stationary (non-oscillatory) instability that promotes interface deformations, and an oscillatory instability that can give rise to persistent capillary waves propagating along the boundaries of phase-separated domains. To characterize these phenomena, we develop a perturbative framework that predicts the onset, wavelength, and velocity of capillary waves, and quantitatively validate these predictions through numerical simulations. Beyond the linear regime, our simulations reveal that capillary waves undergo a secondary instability, leading to either stationary or dynamically evolving superpositions of different wave modes. Finally, we investigate whether capillary waves can facilitate directed mass transport, either along phase boundaries (conveyor belts) or through self-sustained liquid gears crawling along a solid wall. Taken together, our results establish a general framework for interfacial dynamics in active phase-separating systems and suggest new strategies for controlling mass transport in soft matter and biological condensates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Meier, Asif I. Bhatti, Leo Kestens, Stefaan Cottenier</p>
            <p>Hydrogen uptake into body-centered cubic (bcc) iron as a root cause for subsequent hydrogen embrittlement, is initiated at the surface. In this paper, we quantify how readily H diffuses from the surface into the bulk. We consider a set of low-index, vicinal and general Fe surfaces and treat H-permeation as a two-step process. First, density-functional calculations determine the adsorption energy of an isolated H atom at every crystallographically distinct surface site. Second, for each adsorption site we map the minimum-energy pathway that carries the atom beneath the surface and into the lattice. Across all ten orientations studied, a clear trend emerges: sites that bind hydrogen most weakly (highest adsorption energy) are the starting point of the lowest-barrier diffusion channels into the metal interior. Thus, the least-favorable adsorption pockets act as gateways for efficient subsurface penetration. These insights provide a practical design rule: suppressing or minimizing exposure of such high-energy adsorption motifs - through appropriate surface texturing or orientation control - should make bcc-iron components less susceptible to hydrogen uptake and the associated embrittlement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junwen Yin, Olle Hellman, Samuel Poncé</p>
            <p>Charge carrier mobilities are critical parameters in halide perovskite solar cells, governing their average carrier velocity under an applied electric field and overall efficiency. Recent advances in first-principles calculations of electron-phonon interactions and carrier mobilities have enabled predictive computations for perovskite solar cells. However, the flexible octahedral frameworks and cationic displacements in these materials challenge the harmonic approximation, leading to significant difficulties in accurately calculating transport properties. To address these issues, we combine temperature-dependent effective potentials with the ab initio Boltzmann transport equations to compute carrier mobilities in a representative lead-free perovskite, CsSnBr$_3$. At room temperature, the electron/hole Hall mobilities in CsSnBr$_3$ are 106/256 cm$^2$/Vs when neglecting anharmonic effects and 59/145 cm$^2$/Vs when included. This overestimation of the harmonic approximation arises from the neglect of scattering coming from soft modes. We provide a workflow for performing first-principles carrier mobility calculations in anharmonic systems, advancing the predictive modeling of perovskite solar cells.</p>

This method incorporates the nonperturbative local physics from a reference solution and builds all parquet diagrams while circumventing potentially divergent irreducible vertices. Its unbiased treatment of different fluctuations is crucial for reproducing the strong-coupling pseudogap in the underdoped Hubbard model, consistent with diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations. We reveal a strong-coupling spin-fluctuation mechanism of the pseudogap with decisive vertex corrections that encode the cooperation of direct- and exchange-type scattering between electrons and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.</p>

            <p>In this letter we consider the time dependent Kondo model where a magnetic impurity interacts with the electrons through a time dependent interaction strength $J(t)$. Using the Bethe ansatz framework, an exact solution to the time dependent Schrodinger equation is constructed. We show that when periodic boundary conditions are applied, the consistency of the solution results in a constraint equation which relates the amplitudes corresponding to a certain ordering of the particles in the configuration space. This constraint equation takes the form of a matrix difference equation, and the associated consistency conditions restrict the interaction strength $J(t)$ for the system to be integrable. For a given $J(t)$ satisfying these constraints, the solution to the matrix difference equations provides the exact many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The framework developed in this work is general and provides a method to solve new class of Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strength which are based on quantum Yang-Baxter algebra.</p>

            <p>Auger parameter analysis provides in-depth information about the electronic and chemical bonding properties of TiN and AlN thin films, which are relevant across a wide range of technologies. Meaningful interpretation and analysis of the Auger parameter of these materials have been hindered due to, among other reasons, the absence of reliable references. Here we present a comprehensive study of Auger parameters for TiN and AlN thin films using a dual-source lab-based XPS/HAXPES system equipped with Al Ka and Cr Ka x-ray sources. Due to a large spread of excitation x-ray energy, bulk- and surface-sensitive core-level photoelectrons and Auger transitions are probed. This allows us to study a wide range of Auger and core-level emission lines of TiN and AlN. These measurements can serve as references for further identification of chemical state changes, oxidation state or any deviations in the local chemical environment in these materials. UHV sample transfer was employed to minimise surface contamination. Additionally, we demonstrate how common procedures such as ambient air exposure and Ar+ sputter-etching influence the Auger parameters, highlighting the importance of surface preparation in spectroscopic analysis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Illia Lukin, Andrii Sotnikov, Alexander L. Burin</p>
            <p>Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.</p>

            <p>Titanium carbide and nitride MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic materials that exhibit noteworthy physical and chemical properties. These materials are considered for a variety of technological applications, ranging from energy harvesting to optical and biomedical applications. Given the growing interest in titanium MXenes, there is an expanding demand for computational studies to predict physical properties and behaviors under diverse physical conditions. Complex and large-scale systems necessitate computational methodologies that surpass the constraints imposed by ab initio calculations. In this regard, it is imperative to ascertain the reliability of the computational tools employed to simulate and predict the physical properties of titanium MXenes. In this study, the ability of three known classical molecular dynamics (MD) potentials to provide the structural and elastic properties of titanium carbide and nitride MXenes is evaluated. The MD potentials that were the focus of this study include the Charge-Optimized Many-Body (COMB3), the Reactive Force Field (REAXFF) and the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM). These three potentials possess two or more sets of parameters, herein referred to as force fields, capable of simulating Ti-C and Ti-N systems. The MD results for the lattice parameter and thickness of the MXenes are then compared to those from DFT calculations found in the literature. A total of ten force fields were considered; of these, two REAXFF and two MEAM ones were identified as the most adequate to simulate both the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes. Additionally, the values for the linear compressibility of MXenes are presented for the first time. Consequently, researchers can utilize the obtained results to design novel MD-based computational studies of titanium MXenes, leveraging the established relative validity of the available force fields.</p>

            <h2>Mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of random transverse-field Ising chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Róbert Juhász</p>
            <p>Based on the strong-disorder renormalization group method, a microscopic mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain is proposed, which represents the annealing process as a gradual aggregation of strongly coupled spin clusters. The ferromagnetic ground states of clusters are either preserved or get excited in pairwise fusions of clusters, depending on the effective annealing rate of the fusion, the latter events being responsible for the appearance of defects in the final state. An interesting consequence of the theory is that, although the Griffiths-McCoy phases surrounding the critical point are gapless, these phases are still effectively gapped from the point of view of quantum annealing. Thereby we provide an a posteriori justification of the assumption on the finiteness of gap outside of the critical point tacitly used in earlier works, and also refine the functional form of its vanishing at the critical point. The defect density in the final state is found to decrease with the annealing time $\tau$ asymptotically as $n(\tau)\sim \ln^{-2}\left(\frac{\tau}{\ln^2\tau}\right)$. In addition to this, our approach gives access also to the time-dependent density of defects accumulated during the annealing process at intermediate times.</p>

            <p>We consider unconventional magnets with and without spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity and demonstrate the emergence of spin triplet states due to light drives. In particular, we find that a high-frequency linearly polarized light drive induces a spin-triplet density in $d$-wave altermagnets which does not exist in the static regime and can directly reveal the strength of the altermagnetic field. In this high-frequency regime, we also show that linearly polarized light enables the formation of odd-frequency spin-triplet superconducting correlations possessing $d$-wave and $s$-wave parities, which can be controlled by the light drive and accessed by measuring the spin density. Moreover, for low-frequency linearly and circularly polarized light drives, we obtain that the types of superconducting correlations are broadened due to the presence of Floquet bands, enabling spin-triplet pairs in $d$- and $p$-wave unconventional magnets, which are absent in the undriven phase.</p>

            <p>Spatio-temporal scaling dynamics connected to non-thermal fixed points has been suggested as a universal framework to describe the relaxation of isolated far-from-equilibrium systems. Experimental studies in weakly-interacting cold atom systems have found scaling dynamics connected to specific attractors. In our experiments, we study a quantum gas of strongly interacting $^6$Li$_2$ Feshbach molecules, brought far out of equilibrium by imprinting a white-noise phase profile. The observed relaxation follows the same universal dynamics as for the previously observed formation of the order parameter in a shock-cooled gas of weakly interacting $^{87}$Rb atoms. Our results point to a single universal fixed point with a large basin of attraction governing the relaxation of quasi-1D bosonic systems, independent of their specific initial conditions and microscopic details.</p>

            <p>Understanding the fracture mechanics of soft solids remains a fundamental challenge due to their complex, nonlinear responses under large deformations. While multiaxial loading is key to probing their mechanical behavior, the role of such loading in fracture processes is still poorly understood. Here, we present a combined experimental-computational framework to investigate fracture in soft elastomers under equi-biaxial loading. We report original equi-biaxial quasi-static experiments on five elastomeric materials, revealing a spectrum of material and fracture behavior, from brittle-like to highly deformable response with crack tip strains exceeding 150 %. Motivated by these observations, we develop a hybrid computational testbed that mirrors the experimental setup and enables virtual biaxial tests. Central to this framework are two components: a data-adaptive formulation of hyperelastic energy functions that flexibly captures material behavior, and a post-processing implementation of the Configurational Force Method, providing a computationally efficient estimate of the J-integral at the crack tip. Our data-adaptive framework for hyperelastic energy functions proves versatility to capture with high accuracy the hyperelastic behavior observed in the biaxial experiments. This is important because accurately capturing the constitutive behaviour of soft solids is key for a reliable application of the Configurational Force Method to soft solids. In the limit of crack onset, a critical value of the crack tip configurational force allows for a criterion of fracture toughness. Together, our experimental, theoretical, and computational contributions offer a new paradigm for characterizing and designing soft materials with tailored fracture properties.</p>

            <p>We investigates the effective interactions between anyons emerging from either model or realistic bare electron-electron (e-e) interactions in Laughlin and Moore-Read fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids. Instead of being purely repulsive or attractive, such anyons display rich dynamics with interesting experimental consequences. Two Laughlin anyons prefer to form bound states with short-range e-e interactions, leading to $2e/3$ bunched quasiholes at low temperatures instead of the $e/3$ quasiholes. In non-Abelian Moore-Read FQH phases, two $e/4$ quasiholes can fuse into topologically distinct ''1'' or ''$\psi$'' anyons that are no longer degenerate with realistic two-body e-e interactions. This suggests the possibility to energetically separate and manipulate the two types of anyons by tuning the bare electron-electron interactions. We propose that the recently developed high-resolution STM measurements can be used to probe effective anyon interactions when anyons are clustered together after the tunneling of electrons. The local density of states from various bound states of anyon clusters are simulated for both Abelian and non-Abelian systems with (screened) Coulomb interactions.</p>

The EF process achieved a higher MP removal efficiency than the AO-H2O2 process for all applied current densities. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal after 6 h of treatment at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 reached 75.0% and 91.9% for the AO- H2O2 and EF processes, respectively. The combination of EF and UV light improved the efficiency of the EF process. The PEF process achieved a TOC removal of 84.6% in only 2 h at 5 mA cm-2 and 96.8% after 6 h of treatment. Furthermore, based on identifying oxidation reaction intermediates and short-chain carboxylic acids generated during the treatment, a reaction pathway for methylparaben mineralization by hydroxyl radicals was proposed.</p>

            <p>The speed of information propagation in long-range interacting quantum systems is limited by Lieb-Robinson-type bounds, whose tightness can be established by finding specific quantum state-transfer protocols. Previous works have given quantum state-transfer protocols that saturate the corresponding Lieb-Robinson bounds using time-dependent Hamiltonians. Are speed limits for quantum information propagation different for time-independent Hamiltonians? In a step towards addressing this question, we present and analyze two optimal time-independent state-transfer protocols for free-particle systems, which utilize continuous-time single-particle quantum walks with hopping strength decaying as a power law. We rigorously prove and numerically confirm that our protocols achieve quantum state transfer, with controllable error over an arbitrarily long distance in any spatial dimension, at the speed limits set by the free-particle Lieb-Robinson bounds. This shows that time independence does not limit information flow for long-range free-particle Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>Two-level system defects (TLSs) in dielectrics are believed to be the primary source of decoherence in superconducting circuits. However, the precise origin of these defects, including their atomistic morphology, frequency distributions, and dipole moments, remains relatively unexplored. A significant reason for this lack of understanding is that TLS defects are currently probed with resonators or qubits that require complex multi-stage fabrication processes. These probes are packaged, cooled in a dilution refrigerator, and measured to infer their corresponding coherence times. However, even frequency-tunable probes only gather information about TLS defects within their mode volume and a narrow bandwidth around their resonance frequency. As a result, a detailed understanding of the atomistic origins of TLS defects in isolated materials and interfaces is currently lacking, making it challenging to design the next generation of superconducting devices and dielectric materials from first principles. Here, we introduce a novel approach that enables probing the cryogenic dielectric response of TLS defect ensembles using a broadband 3D waveguide. This technique provides evidence of memory effects in the dynamics of TLS defect ensembles that may enable the extraction of critical information about the origins of the underlying TLS defects and their interactions. Importantly, this novel spectroscopy technique can be used at all stages of fabrication and ultimately inform mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of TLS defects on superconducting circuits. As a result, this technique will help usher in a new understanding of the atomistic origin of TLS defects, which will have profound consequences for quantum information science and the broader materials science community.</p>

            <h2>Non-Clifford gates between stabilizer codes via non-Abelian topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohith Sajith, Zijian Song, Brenden Roberts, Varun Menon, Yabo Li</p>
            <p>We propose protocols to implement non-Clifford logical gates between stabilizer codes by entangling into a non-Abelian topological order as an intermediate step. Generalizing previous approaches, we provide a framework that generates a large class of non-Clifford and non-diagonal logical gates between qudit surface codes by gauging the topological symmetry of symmetry-enriched topological orders. As our main example, we concretely detail a protocol that utilizes the quantum double of $S_3$ to generate a controlled-charge conjugation ($C\mathcal{C}$) gate between a qubit and qutrit surface code. Both the preparation of non-Abelian states and logical state injection between the Abelian and non-Abelian codes are executed via finite-depth quantum circuits with measurement and feedforward. We discuss aspects of the fault-tolerance of our protocol, presenting insights on how to construct a heralded decoder for the quantum double of $S_3.$ We also outline how analogous protocols can be used to obtain logical gates between qudit surface codes by entangling into $\mathcal{D}(G),$ where $G$ is a semidirect product of Abelian groups. This work serves as a step towards classifying the computational power of non-Abelian quantum phases beyond the paradigm of anyon braiding on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal conductivity \k{appa} comparable to that of diamond, yet experimental measurements have plateaued at ~1300W/mK. We report room-temperature \k{appa} exceeding 2000W/mK in c-BAs, on par with single-crystal diamond. This finding is enabled by high-quality single crystals and a newly developed nanosecond, transducer-less time-domain thermoreflectance technique that allows spatial mapping of \k{appa} without metal transducers. Thermal conductivity correlates with crystal quality, as evidenced by stronger photoluminescence and longer photoluminescence lifetimes. However, the observed nanosecond lifetimes remain shorter than expected for an indirect bandgap semiconductor, suggesting room for further crystal quality improvement and higher \k{appa}. These results challenge current theoretical models and highlight c-BAs as a promising material for next-generation electronics.</p>

            <h2>Improving variational counterdiabatic driving with weighted actions and computer algebra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naruo Ohga, Takuya Hatomura</p>
            <p>Variational counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a disciplined and widely used method to robustly control quantum many-body systems by mimicking adiabatic processes with high fidelity and reduced duration. Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it effectively incorporates nonlocal information, and it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable, as it can replace almost all previous uses of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Xuan Wang, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.</p>

            <p>This work demonstrates photon emission gain, i.e., emission of multiple photons per injected electron, through impact excitation in Er-doped silicon light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Conventional methods for exciting Er ions in silicon suffer from low efficiency due to mismatched energy transfer between exciton recombination and Er excitation. Here, we propose a reverse-biased Si PN junction diode where ballistically accelerated electrons induce inelastic collisions with Er ions, enabling tunable excitation via electric field modulation. Theoretical modeling reveals that photon emission gain arises from multiple impact excitations by a single electron traversing the electroluminescence region, with the gain value approximating the ratio of emission region width to electron mean free path, i.e., G = Lex/l. Experimental results show an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 1.84% at 78 K, representing a 20-fold enhancement over room-temperature performance. This work provides a critical foundation for on-chip integration of silicon-based communication-band lasers and quantum light sources.</p>

            <p>For the past 25 years, the Gset benchmark problems have challenged all manner of Ising and Max-Cut solvers. The largest of these problems have remained unsolved by any heuristic algorithm. In this report we provide data showing dramatically better speed and accuracy on these large sparse problems. Our newly discovered heuristic algorithm called Cosm reaches high (99.9% of best) solution quality orders of magnitude faster than the previous best heuristic solver results. Additionally, when afforded enough steps Cosm attains higher cuts than ever previously reported, specifically on instances G72 (cut=7008), G77 (cut=9940), and the 20,000-variable G81 (cut=14060). This report includes solution bitstrings so that the cuts can be independently validated. Remarkably, the new best solutions appear to be optimal.

            <p>We compare the multipartite entangling and disentangling powers of unitary operators by assessing their ability to generate or eliminate genuine multipartite entanglement. Our findings reveal that while diagonal unitary operators can exhibit equal entangling and disentangling powers, certain non-diagonal unitaries demonstrate an imbalance when acting on fully separable states, thereby extending the known disparity from bipartite systems to those with any number of parties. Counterintuitively, we construct classes of unitaries and their adjoints that display unequal entanglement generation capacities, behaving differently when applied to systems with an even number of qubits compared to those with an odd number. Further, we illustrate that this asymmetry can be simulated using physically realizable Hamiltonians: systems with an even number of qubits employ nearest-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, while those with an odd number utilize a combination of Heisenberg and DM interactions. Additionally, we present a circuit composed of random noncommuting unitaries, constructed from alternating layers of two-qubit Haar-random gates, to illustrate the discrepancy in the entangling and disentangling capabilities of unitaries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel J. Korchinski, Dhruva Karkada, Yasaman Bahri, Matthieu Wyart</p>
            <p>Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} - W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix $M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and (iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation (e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties (i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.</p>

            <h2>The Gilbert Damping Factor of Heavy Quark Spin Polarization in the Magnetic Field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyang Li, Anping Huang, Baoyi Chen</p>
            <p>We employ the linear response theory to calculate the polarization rate of heavy quark spin in the presence of a strong magnetic field and the hot QCD matter, both of which are simultaneously generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The hot QCD medium is simplified as a fermionic system consisting of only quarks. The spin of heavy quarks can be polarized as a result of combined contributions from spin-spin interactions between quarks and spin-magnetic field interactions. This spin dynamics is modeled as consisting of a polarization term and a dissipation term, which is described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation and widely studied in condensed matter physics, analogous to the momentum evolution in the Langevin equation. In this study, we calculate the Gilbert damping factor that characterizes the spin polarization rate of heavy quarks, considering a Coulomb potential between two fermions in the medium. The dependence of the heavy quark spin polarization rate on the strength of the magnetic field, the heavy quark mass, temperature, and baryon chemical potential is studied in detail. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of quark spin dynamics in the hot QCD medium and the magnetic field.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present a novel approach to process the DIC measurements of multiple biaxial stretching protocols. In particular, we develop a optimization-based approach, which calculates the smoothed nodal displacements using a moving least-squares algorithm subject to positive strain constraints. As such, physically consistent displacement and strain fields are obtained. Then, we further deploy a data-driven workflow to heterogeneous material modeling from these physically consistent DIC measurements, by estimating a nonlocal constitutive law together with the material microstructure. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it in learning a material model and fiber orientation field from DIC measurements of a porcine tricuspid valve anterior leaflet. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DIC data processing approach can significantly improve the accuracy of modeling biological materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dinesh Kumar, Eralp Demir, Julio Spadotto, Kazuma Kobayashi, Syed Bahauddin Alam, Brian Connolly, Ed Pickering, Paul Wilcox, David Knowles, Mahmoud Mostafavi</p>
            <p>The mechanical properties and long-term structural reliability of crystalline materials are strongly influenced by microstructural features such as grain size, morphology, and crystallographic texture. These characteristics not only determine the initial mechanical behavior but also govern the progression of degradation mechanisms, such as strain localization, fatigue damage, and microcrack initiation under service conditions. Variability in these microstructural attributes, introduced during manufacturing or evolving through in-service degradation, leads to uncertainty in material performance. Therefore, understanding and quantifying microstructure-sensitive plastic deformation is critical for assessing degradation risk in high-value mechanical systems. This study presents a first-of-its-kind machine learning-driven framework that couples high-fidelity crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations with data-driven surrogate modeling to accelerate degradation-aware uncertainty quantification in welded structural alloys. Specifically, the impact of crystallographic texture variability in 316L stainless steel weldments, characterized via high-throughput electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), is examined through CPFE simulations on calibrated representative volume elements (RVEs). A polynomial chaos expansion-based surrogate model is then trained to efficiently emulate the CPFE response using only 200 simulations, reducing computational cost by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional Monte Carlo analysis. The surrogate enables rapid quantification of uncertainty in stress-strain behavior and identifies texture components such as Cube and Goss as key drivers of degradation-relevant plastic response.</p>

            <p>Physics-inspired computing paradigms, such as Ising machines, are emerging as promising hardware alternatives to traditional von Neumann architectures for tackling computationally intensive combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). While quantum, optical, and electronic devices have garnered significant attention for their potential in realizing Ising machines, their translation into practical systems for industry-relevant applications remains challenging, with each approach facing specific limitations in power consumption and speed. To address this challenge, we report the first chip-level spintronic Ising machine using voltage-controlled magnetoresistive random access memory. The core of our design leverages magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) driven by the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy effect to realize the probabilistic update of Ising spins through a new mechanism. It enables a latency below 1 ns and an energy consumption under 40 fJ per spin update, achieving a 1000-times improvement over previous current-driven MTJ-based implementations. We map two real-world COPs in electronic design automation-global routing and layer assignment-onto the Ising model and demonstrate high-quality results with an energy efficiency of 25000 solutions per second per watt. This outperforms state-of-the-art quantum and graphics processing units by six and seven orders of magnitude, respectively. These results establish voltage-controlled spintronics as a compelling route towards next-generation physics-inspired machine intelligence, offering a paradigm for ultra-low-power, high-speed, and scalable computation.</p>

            <p>The simplicity of encoding a qubit in the state of a single electron spin and the potential for their integration into industry-standard microchips continue to drive the field of semiconductor-based quantum computing. However, after decades of progress, validating universal logic in these platforms has advanced little beyond first-principles demonstrations of meeting the DiVincenzo criteria. Case in point, and specifically for silicon-based quantum dots, three-qubit algorithms have been the upper limit to date, despite the availability of devices containing more qubits. In this work, we fully exploit the capacity of a spin-qubit array and implement a six qubit quantum circuit, the largest utilizing semiconductor quantum technology. By programming the quantum processor, we execute quantum circuits across all permutations of three, four, five, and six neighbouring qubits, demonstrating successful programmable multi-qubit operation throughout the array. The results reveal that, despite the high quality of individual units, errors quickly accumulate when combining all of them in a quantum circuit. This work highlights the necessity to minimize idling times through simultaneous operations, boost dephasing times, and consistently improve state preparation and measurement fidelities.</p>

            <p>We investigate the space time fractional nonlinear Schrodinger equation (FNLSE) incorporating the modified Riemann Liouville derivative introduced by Jumari. The equation is characterized by two parameters: the fractional derivative parameter (alpha, which captures the memory effects) and the non linearity parameter a. We present analytical solutions via three complementary approaches: the fractional Riccati method, the Adomian decomposition method, and the scaling method. The FNLSE is formulated in terms of generalized Hamiltonian and momentum operators, allowing a unified framework to explore various solution structures. A continuity equation is derived, and a general class of solutions based on Mittag Leffler (ML) plane waves is proposed, from which generalized momentum and energy eigenvalues are systematically classified. Utilizing a generalized Wick rotation, we establish a connection between the FNLSE and a fractional Fokker Planck equation governing a dual stochastic process, revealing links to Q Gaussian statistics. Through separation of variables, we classify a family of solutions including chiral ML plane waves. Additionally, we construct Riccati type bright and dark solitons and assess their stability using a dynamical distance metric. As alpha changes, i.e. the memory effects are tuned, the bright solitons transform to dark solitons, which is equivalent to focusing defocusing transition. A series solution is developed via the Adomian decomposition technique, applied to both chiral and plane wave cases. Finally, we reduce the dimensionality of the FNLSE using the scaling arguments, leading to self similar solutions, and find pure phase as well as Adomian type solutions. Our results highlight the rich analytical landscape of the FNLSE and provide insights into its underlying physical and mathematical structure.</p>

            <p>Our knowledge of past cultures relies considerably on written material. For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies ("stemmata"), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic "biodiversity" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance ("drift") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation.</p>

            <p>We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is universal. That is, it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term, as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. By considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we also derive the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudomodes for quantum environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Spethmann, Peter Stano, Daniel Loss</p>
            <p>Across most qubit platforms, the readout fidelities do not keep up with the gate fidelities, and new ways to increase the readout fidelities are searched for. For semiconductor spin qubits, a typical qubit-readout signal consists of a finite stretch of a digitized charge-sensor output. Such a signal trace is usually analyzed by compressing it into a single value, either maximum or sum. The binary measurement result follows by comparing the single value to a decision threshold fixed in advance. This threshold method, while simple and fast, omits information that could potentially improve the readout fidelity. Here, we analyze what can be achieved by more sophisticated signal-trace processing using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The HMM is a natural choice, being the optimal statistical processing if the noise is white. It also has a computationally efficient implementation, known as the forward-backward algorithm, making HMM processing practical. However, unlike in many computer-simulation studies, in real experiments the noise is correlated. How this change affects the HMM implementation and reliability is our subject. We find that the HMM using white noise as the system statistical model is surprisingly sensitive to correlations; it only tolerates very small correlation times. We suggest alleviating this deficiency by a signal pre-filtering. The correlations have a similar strongly negative impact on the HMM model calibration (the Baum-Welch algorithm). Besides studying the effects of noise correlations, as a specific application of the HMM we calculate the readout fidelity at elevated temperatures, relevant to recent experimental pursuits of `hot' spin qubits.</p>

The price to pay is that the vacuum of the waveguide in this modeling becomes the Bogoliubov vacuum, and one has to consider a not-so-small local Hilbert space for bosonic degrees of freedom. To manage the large local Hilbert space, we adopt the recently proposed single-site schemes.

            <p>The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.</p>

            <h2>On the asymptotic scaling of the von Neumann entropy in quasifree fermionic right mover/left mover systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Walter H. Aschbacher</p>
            <p>For the general class of quasifree fermionic right mover/left mover systems over the infinitely extended two-sided discrete line introduced in [8] within the algebraic framework of quantum statistical mechanics, we study the von Neumann entropy of a contiguous subsystem of finite length in interaction with its environment. In particular, under the assumption of spatial translation invariance, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the von Neumann entropy for large subsystem lengths and prove that its leading order density is, in general, nonvanishing and displays the signature of a mixture of the independent thermal species underlying the right mover/left mover system. As special cases, the formalism covers so-called nonequilibrium steady states, thermal equilibrium states, and ground states. Moreover, for general Fermi functions, we derive a necessary and sufficient criterion for the von Neumann entropy density to vanish.</p>

            <h2>Tight Generalization of Robertson-Type Uncertainty Relations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gen Kimura, Aina Mayumi, Haruki Yamashita</p>
            <p>We establish the tightest possible Robertson-type preparation uncertainty relation, which explicitly depends on the eigenvalue spectrum of the quantum state. The conventional constant 1/4 is replaced by a state-dependent coefficient with the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the density operator. This coefficient is optimal among all Robertson-type generalizations and does not admit further improvement. Our relation becomes more pronounced as the quantum state becomes more mixed, capturing a trade-off in quantum uncertainty that the conventional Robertson relation fails to detect. In addition, our result provides a strict generalization of the Schroedinger uncertainty relation, showing that the uncertainty trade-off is governed by the sum of the covariance term and a state-dependent improvement over the Robertson bound. As applications, we also refine error-disturbance trade-offs by incorporating spectral information of both the system and the measuring apparatus, thereby generalizing the Arthurs-Goodman and Ozawa inequalities.</p>

            <p>The study of effective potential for the scalar Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics in one-loop is presented in this letter. The planar and non-local Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics is so coupled to a complex scalar field sector in 1+2 dimensions, where we achieve the Lee-Wick pseudo-scalar electrodynamics. The effective action formalism is applied such that the quantum corrections are examined in one loop to the scalar effective potential as function of the classical field, of the Lee-Wick mass, and also of the coupling constants of this model. The instability of the effective potential is investigated due to Lee-Wick mass.</p>

            <h2>Universal scaling of intra-urban climate fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Duran-Sala, Martin Hendrick, Gabriele Manoli</p>
            <p>Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as the urban heat island effect and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population or area). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population counts, and street intersections from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions follow universal scaling functions. By using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we show that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. We further demonstrate that traditional models linking climate variables to the distance from the city center fail to reproduce the observed distributions unless the stochasticity of urban structure is fully considered. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modelling and urban planning.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical framework for analyzing aperiodically ordered photonic time quasicrystals (PTQCs), which are the temporal analogs of spatial photonic quasicrystals. Using a general two-symbol substitutional sequence to model temporal modulations, we extend the trace and anti-trace map formalism used for spatial photonic quasicrystals to the temporal domain. Focusing on the Thue-Morse sequence as a representative example, we examine the band structure and wave-transport properties, discussing their physical origins and highlighting both similarities and key differences with conventional periodic photonic time crystals. Furthermore, we investigate the peculiar features of PTQCs, such as multiscale spectral response and localization effects. Our findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between aperiodic order and wave dynamics in time-varying media, highlighting its potential to enable the development of advanced photonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciaran O Malley, Muhammad Usaid Memon, Krishna Hari, Tara Ryan, Sarah Guerin</p>
            <p>Biomolecular crystals, such as amino acids, peptides, and proteins, have emerged as potential next generation piezoelectric materials due to their low-cost, biocompatibility, eco-friendliness, and reduced permittivity versus ceramics. However, many challenges have limited their acceleration into mainstream sensing applications. Their natural self-assembly from saturated solutions into polycrystalline films reduces their effective piezoelectric output, and results in high variability within individual samples, and across sample batches when scaled-up. Here we validate the sublimation of a variety of amino acids onto conductive substrates as an effective technique for overcoming these challenges. This solvent-free crystallisation technique results in polycrystalline films with uniformly orientated crystals, and a resulting piezoelectric response that exceeds that of single crystals. We report a maximum piezoelectric response of 9.6 pC/N in films of L-Valine, which matches the predicted single crystal response, and a maximum voltage output of 4.6 V. For L-Methionine and L-Valine sublimated films the material properties are consistent at all points on the piezoelectric films and repeatable across any number of films grown under the same conditions.</p>

            <p>Computing the vacuum expectation of fermion number operator on a soliton background is often challenging. A recent proposal in arXiv:2305.1360(6) simplifies this task by considering the soliton in a bounded region and relating the $\eta$ invariant, and thus the fermion number, to a specific heat kernel coefficient and to contributions from the edge states. We test this method in a system of charged fermions living on an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortex background. We show that the resulting $\eta$ invariant is independent of boundary conditions, confirming the validity of the method. Our analysis reveals a nontrivial feature for the fermionic spectrum in the vortex-induced Higgs phase. As a by-product, we also find that for a vortex living on a disk, the edge states carry fractional charge.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C.-C. Joseph Wang, Jean-Pierre Julien, A. V. Balatsky, Jian-Xin Zhu</p>
            <p>Shortly after the discovery of topological band insulators, the topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) have also been theoretically predicted. The latter has ignited revival interest in the properties of Kondo insulators. Currently, the feasibility of topological nature in SmB$_6$ has been intensively analyzed by several complementary probes. Here by starting with a minimal-orbital Anderson lattice model, we explore the local electronic structure in a Kondo insulator. We show that the two strong topological regimes sandwiching the weak topological regime give rise to a single Dirac cone, which is located near the center or corner of the surface Brillouin zone. We further find that, when a single impurity is placed on the surface, low-energy resonance states are induced in the weak scattering limit for the strong TKI regimes and the resonance level moves monotonically across the hybridization gap with the strength of impurity scattering potential; while low energy states can only be induced in the unitary scattering limit for the weak TKI regime, where the resonance level moves universally toward the center of the hybridization gap. These impurity induced low-energy quasiparticles will lead to characteristic signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, which has recently found success in probing into exotic properties in heavy fermion systems.</p>

            <p>Topological superconductivity is expected to spur Majorana zero modes -- exotic states that are also considered a quantum technology asset. Fractional Josephson effect is their manifestation in electronic transport measurements, often under microwave irradiation. A fraction of induced resonances, known as Shapiro steps, should vanish, in a pattern that signifies the presence of Majorana modes. Here we report patterns of Shapiro steps expected in topological Josephson junctions, such as the missing first Shapiro step, or several missing odd-order steps. But our junctions, which are InAs quantum wells with Al contacts, are studied near zero magnetic field, meaning that they are not in the topological regime. We also observe other patterns such as missing even steps and several missing steps in a row, not relevant to topological superconductivity. Potentially responsible for our observations is rounding of not fully developed steps superimposed on non-monotonic resistance versus voltage curves, but several origins may be at play. Our results demonstrate that any single pattern, even striking, cannot uniquely identify topological superconductivity, and a multifactor approach is necessary to unambiguously establish this important phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Periodic plasmonic arrays making possible excitations of surface lattice resonances (SLRs) or quasi-resonant features are of great importance for biosensing and other applications. Fabrication of such arrays over a large area is typically very costly and time-consuming when performed using conventional electron beam lithography and other methods, which reduce application prospects. Here, we propose a technique of double femtosecond pulse (~ 170 fs) laser-assisted structuring of thin (~ 32 nm) Au films deposited on a glass substrate and report a single-step fabrication of homogeneous and highly ordered Au-based Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) over a large area. Our experimental results unveil the key importance of the interpulse delay as the determining factor rendering possible the homogeneity of laser induced structures and confirm that highly ordered, functional LIPSS occur solely upon double pulse irradiation under a specific interpulse delay range. A theoretical investigation complements experimental results providing remarkable insights on the structure formation mechanism. Ellipsometric measurements show that such LIPSS structures can exhibit highly valuable plasmonic features in light reflection. In particular, we observed ultranarrow resonances associated with diffraction-coupled SLRs, which are of paramount importance for biosensing and other applications. The presented data suggest that femtosecond double pulse structuring of thin metal films can serve as a valuable and low-cost tool for a large-scale fabrication of highly ordered functional elements and structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoki Sugimoto, Ryusuke Hamazaki, Masahito Ueda</p>
            <p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which asserts that every eigenstate of a many-body quantum system is indistinguishable from a thermal ensemble, plays a pivotal role in understanding thermalization of isolated quantum systems. Yet, no evidence has been obtained as to whether the ETH holds for all few-body operators in a chaotic system; such few-body operators include key quantities in statistical mechanics, such as the total magnetization, the momentum distributions, and their low-order thermal and quantum fluctuations. Here, we formulate a conjecture that for a generic nonintegrable system the ETH holds for all $m$-body operators with $m < {\alpha}_{\ast} N$ in the thermodynamic limit for some nonzero constant ${\alpha}_{\ast} > 0$. We first prove this statement for systems with Haar-distributed energy eigenstates to analytically motivate our conjecture. We then verify the conjecture for generic spin, Bose, and Fermi systems with local and few-body interactions by large-scale numerical calculations. Our results imply that generic systems satisfy the ETH for all few-body operators, including their thermal and quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Ghosh, Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We investigate the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations such that a three-dimensional Weyl or multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$, which are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other. The effective magnetic field consists of two parts: (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to the direction of the electric field (or temperature gradient) and elucidate how it affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally, we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.</p>

A promising strategy for the achievement of high sensitivity to external fields relies on the exploitation of large ensembles of NV centers, whose fabrication by ion implantation is upper limited by the amount of radiation damage introduced in the diamond lattice. In this works we demonstrate an approach to increase the density of NV centers upon the high-fluence implantation of MeV N2+ ions on a hot target substrate (>550 °C). Our results show that, with respect to room-temperature implantation, the high-temperature process increases the vacancy density threshold required for the irreversible conversion of diamond to a graphitic phase, thus enabling to achieve higher density ensembles. Furthermore, the formation efficiency of color centers was investigated on diamond substrates implanted at varying temperatures with MeV N2+ and Mg+ ions revealing that the formation efficiency of both NV centers and magnesium-vacancy (MgV) centers increases with the implantation temperature.</p>

We show how electric current can manipulate vortex transport in geometrically nontrivial magnetic systems.

We provide a theoretical analysis of the electronic band structure, enabling a semi-quantitative explanation of the spectra. A prominent feature in the electronic spectra is a redistribution of spectral weight from low to high energies in all polarization configurations starting at the Curie temperature T$_C$. In the symmetry-resolved spectra, the suppression of the A$_{1g}$ continuum in the ferromagnetic state arises from the redistribution of electronic states below T$_C$, while a strong enhancement of the A$_{2g}$ continuum is linked to the dynamics of fermions near the Fermi level $E_{\rm F}$ being characterized by spin-momentum locking near Weyl points. The A$_{1g}$ phonon modulates the position of these Weyl points and couples strongly to the related fermions close to $E_{\rm F}$. These results allow a comprehensive understanding of the bulk band structure evolution as a function of temperature in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, offering key insights for further studies of the driving force behind the long-range magnetic order and novel topological states in this compound.</p>

            <p>We consider a free fermion chain with uniform nearest-neighbor hopping and let it evolve from an arbitrary initial state with a fixed macroscopic number of particles. We then prove that, at a sufficiently large and typical time, the measured coarse-grained density distribution is almost uniform with (quantum mechanical) probability extremely close to one. This establishes the emergence of irreversible behavior, i.e., a ballistic diffusion, in a system governed by quantum mechanical unitary time evolution. It is conceptually important that irreversibility from any initial state is proved here without introducing any randomness to the initial state or the Hamiltonian, while the known examples, both classical and quantum, rely on certain randomness or apply to limited classes of initial states. The essential new ingredient in the proof is the large deviation bound for every energy eigenstate, which is reminiscent of the strong ETH (energy eigenstate thermalization hypothesis).</p>

            <p>The interplay between non-trivial topology and strong electron interaction can generate a variety of exotic quantum matter.

The nontrivial topology of these flat Chern bands originates from the effective $sd^2$ hybridization of transition metal atom, which transform the apparent atomic $d$ orbitals on a hexagonal lattice into $(s, p_+, p_-)$ orbitals on a triangular lattice. Interestingly, the quantum geometry of flat Chern bands in these materials are comparable with those in moiré systems exhibiting fractional Chern insulator state. The Hofstadter butterfly of such flat Chern bands are further studied. These natural materials, if realized experimentally, could offer new platforms to explore correlated phenomena driven by flat Chern band with higher Chern number.</p>

            <p>In spiral multiferroics, magnetism induces ferroelectricity, thus holding a promise for novel memory devices where an electric field switches magnetic bits. However, such a switching process, in which magnetic domain walls are moved electrically, is still poorly understood. We find multiferroic domain walls containing arrays of meron (half-skyrmion) strings with a plethora of topological defects, which profoundly affect wall dynamics. Minimum energy walls have alternating meron topological charges and move as relativistic massive particles, with velocity limited by the magnon speed. During domain nucleation, walls with non-alternating meron charges appear. Such defects result in a peculiar non-local dynamics where all the spins in the system rotate, and the wall mobility is suppressed. Meron strings possess 0D hedgehog defects, analogous to Bloch points, that pin the wall to the lattice. This fascinating interplay of magnetoelectric switching with a variety of topological defects and non-local spin dynamics opens a new playground for the electric manipulation of spins.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kwangmin Lee, Ryan C. Hurley</p>
            <p>Recent studies have established correlations between non-affine motion and macroscopic stress fluctuations in sheared granular media. However, a comprehensive examination of the relationship between non-affine motion, macroscopic stress fluctuations, and inter-particle forces remains lacking. We investigated this interplay in simulations of 2D granular media during stick-slip events under plane shear. We found that, during most large slip events, particles with the greatest non-affine motion, as quantified by D2min, initially coalesce into one or two dominant connected clusters. These clusters coincide with the region exhibiting the greatest instantaneous reduction in inter-particle forces, indicating a significant correlation between inter-particle force fluctuations and particle rearrangements. Furthermore, the magnitude of the greatest non-affine motion within these clusters correlates strongly with the magnitude of macroscopic stress fluctuations during slip events. This correlation increased when the non-affine motion of particles in a neighborhood around the point of greatest non-affine motion was included in the analysis, suggesting that plastic events are best understood as regional rather than point-like occurrences. Our results held for various inter-particle friction coefficients. Our findings suggest that elastoplastic models should consider plastic events as regional rather than point-like and highlight the importance of studying the propagation of particle rearrangements.</p>

            <p>Higher-order topological insulators are an intriguing new family of topological states that host lower-dimensional boundary states. Concurrently, quasiperiodic systems have garnered significant interest due to their complex localization and topological properties. In this work we study the impact of chiral symmetry preserving quasiperiodic modulations on the paradigmatic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, which hosts topological insulating phases with zero-energy sublattice-polarized modes. We find that the topological properties are not only robust to the quasiperiodic modulation, but can even be enriched. In particular, we unveil the first instance of a quasiperiodic induced second-order topological insulating phase. Furthermore, in contrast with disorder, we find that quasiperiodic modulations can induce multiple reentrant topological transitions, showing an intricate sequence of localization properties. Our results open a promising avenue for exploring the rich interplay between higher-order topology and quasiperiodicity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Blaber, Daniel Bruns, Jörg Rottler</p>
            <p>Dissipation in amorphous solids at low frequencies is commonly attributed to activated transitions of isolated two-level systems (TLS) that come in resonance with elastic or electric fields. Materials with low mechanical or dielectric loss are urgently needed for applications in gravitational wave detection, high precision sensors, and quantum computing. Using atomistic modeling, we explore the energy landscape of amorphous silicon and titanium dioxide, and find that the pairs of energy minima that constitute single TLS form a sparsely connected network with complex topologies. Motivated by this observation, we develop an analytically tractable theory for mechanical loss of the full network from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. We demonstrate that the connectivity of the network introduces new mechanisms that can both reduce low frequency dissipation through additional low energy relaxation pathways, and increase dissipation through a broad distribution of energy minima. As a result, the connected network model predicts mechanical loss with distinct frequency profiles compared to the isolated TLS model. This not only calls into question the validity of the TLS model, but also gives us many new avenues and properties to analyze for the targeted design of low mechanical loss materials.</p>

            <p>The idea to extract information on magnetically different phases from magnetic measurements is very attractive and many efforts have been made in this area. One of the most popular direction is to use the Preisach model formalism to analyze the 2D Preisach distribution function (PDF) obtained either from first order reversal curves (FORC) or minor loops. Here we present an alternative a much simpler procedure -- the analysis of the derivative of the saturation magnetization loop, the differential susceptibility curve. It follows the Lorentzian shape with very high accuracy for ferromagnetic polycrystalline materials. This allows decomposing any differential susceptibility curve of a complex multi-phase material into individual components representing different magnetic phases by Lorenzian peaks -- in the same way as it is done in X-ray diffraction analysis of materials. We show that the minor differential susceptibility curves also have the Lorenzian shape that can facilitate calculation of the Preisach distribution function from the experimental curves and reduce noise in the resulting PDF.</p>

            <p>Identification of crystallographic slip in metals and alloys is crucial to understand and improve their mechanical behavior. Recently, a novel slip system identification framework, termed SSLIP (for Slip Systems based Local Identification of Plasticity), was introduced to leap from conventional trace-based identification to automated, point-by-point identification, exploiting the full deformation kinematics. Using sub-micron-scale Digital Image Correlation (DIC) deformation fields aligned to Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) data, SSLIP matches the measured in-plane displacement gradient tensor to the kinematics of the optimal combination of multiple slip system activities, at each DIC datapoint. SSLIP was demonstrated to be successful on virtual and experimental case studies of FCC and BCC metals. However, for more challenging HCP crystal structures, the complete identification of all slip systems was found to be more challenging, posing limitations on automation and flexibility. To extend the capabilities of SSLIP, we propose an extended framework, hereinafter referred to as the +SSLIP method, which includes (i) a preselection of slip systems using a Radon transform, (ii) robustness to measured rigid body rotation by simultaneous identification of the local rotation field, (iii) identification of the two best matching slip systems for each data point, and (iv) a procedure to determine groups of slip systems with in-plane displacement gradient tensors that cannot be discriminated. This procedure yields the full (HCP) slip system activity maps for every slip system in each grain. The resulting objective identification method does not rely on the Schmid factor to select which slip system is active at each point. We show how slip systems from multiple slip families are successfully identified on virtual and real experiments on a Zn polycrystalline coating.</p>

            <h2>Multiscale Excitations in the Diluted Two-dimensional S = 1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liuyun Dao, Hui Shao, Anders W. Sandvik</p>
            <p>We study the excitation spectrum of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the randomly diluted square lattice by analytic continuation of QMC data. At dilution fractions $p=1/16$ and $p=1/8$, the dynamic structure factor $S({\bf q},\omega)$ exhibits a damped magnon peak with anomalous dispersion near ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$, a non-dispersive low-energy localization peak, and a second peak between these two features. A magnon with anomalous dispersion, close to our result, was predicted in spin wave and $T$-matrix theory [A. Chernyshev et al., PRB {\bf 65}, 104407 (2002)], above the localization energy. However, no intermediate mode was predicted. Analyzing spectral functions in real space for individual vacancy realizations by energy tomography, we find that these excitations are concentrated on a small subset of the spins adjacent to vacancies. We argue that the low-energy excitations are those of a sparse random network of effective moments at a fraction of the vacancies. There is a shift in magnon spectral weight distribution, from the spins away from vacancies at high energy to those adjacent to vacancies at lower energy. We also analyze the Anderson quantum rotor excitation at $\omega \propto N^{-1}$ (with $N=L^2$ the system size), which in the clean system is visible in $S({\bf q},\omega)$ only at ${\bf q}=(\pi,\pi)$ but spreads through the Brillouin zone when $p>0$. Weight close to ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$ is explained by local sublattice imbalance within a dimer-monomer model but there is also structure arising from correlated singlet fluctuations, which we demonstrate by enhancing said fluctuations with four-spin couplings. All spectral features found here should be observable by elastic neutron scattering experiments on layered quantum antiferromagnets doped with nonmagnetic impurities.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium chemical short-range order in metallic alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmudul Islam, Killian Sheriff, Yifan Cao, Rodrigo Freitas</p>
            <p>Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a ''new knob'' to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.</p>

            <p>While the physics of disordered packing in non-growing systems is well understood, unexplored phenomena can emerge when packing takes place in growing domains. We study the arrangements of pigment cells (chromatophores) on squid skin as a biological example of a packed system on an expanding surface. We find that relative density fluctuations in cell numbers grow with spatial scale. We term this behavior ``hyperdisordered'', in contrast with hyperuniform behavior in which relative fluctuations tend to zero at large scale. We find that hyperdisordered scaling, akin to that of a critical system, is quantitatively reproduced by a model in which hard disks are randomly inserted in a homogeneously growing surface. In addition, we find that chromatophores increase in size during animal development, but maintain a stationary size distribution. The physical mechanisms described in our work may apply to a broad class of growing dense systems.</p>

            <p>The efficient detection of the magnetism in 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators is crucial for the advancement of 2D AFM spintronics and remains a challenging problem. In this letter, we introduce the magnon nonlinear Hall current, a second-order Hall response of collective spin excitations in ordered magnets, as a novel probe for 2D layered AFM insulators. We theoretically demonstrate that the nonlinear Hall effect is intrinsically coupled to the underlying spin configuration. In particular, it exhibits a pronounced layer dependence in layered antiferromagnets, enabling direct characterization of the nature and strength of interlayer magnetic coupling in multilayer AFM insulators. Furthermore, we show that a a slight external field perturbation can induce and manipulate the magnon nonlinear Hall response. Our work establishes a novel approach for exploring 2D antiferromagnetism and holds great promise for AFM spintronic applications</p>

            <h2>Dissipation enables robust extensive scaling of multipartite correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Massimiliano Esposito</p>
            <p>We investigate the multipartite mutual information between $N$ discrete-state stochastic units interacting in a network that is invariant under unit permutations. We show that when the system relaxes to fixed point attractors, multipartite correlations in the stationary state either do not scale extensively with $N$, or the extensive scaling is not robust to arbitrarily small perturbations of the system dynamics. In particular, robust extensive scaling cannot occur in thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, mutual information scales extensively when the system relaxes to time-dependent attractors (e.g., limit cycles), which can occur only far from equilibrium. This demonstrates the essential role of dissipation in the generation and maintenance of multipartite correlations. We illustrate our theory with the nonequilibrium Potts model.</p>

            <h2>Universal Linear Response of the Mean First-Passage Time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommer D. Keidar, Shlomi Reuveni</p>
            <p>First-passage processes are pervasive across numerous scientific fields, yet a general framework for understanding their response to external perturbations remains elusive. While the fluctuation-dissipation theorem offers a complete linear response theory for systems in steady-state, it fails to apply to transient first-passage processes. We address this challenge by focusing on rare, rather than weak, perturbations. Surprisingly, we discover that the linear response of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to such perturbations is universal. It depends solely on the first two moments of the unperturbed first-passage time and the mean completion time following perturbation activation, without any assumptions about the underlying system's dynamics. To demonstrate the utility of our findings, we analyze the MFPT response of drift-diffusion processes in two scenarios: (i) stochastic resetting with information feedback, and (ii) an abrupt transition from a linear to a logarithmic potential. In both cases, our approach bypasses the need for explicit determination of the perturbed dynamics, unraveling a highly non-trivial response landscape with minimal effort. Finally, we show how our framework enables a new type of experiment-inferring molecular-level fluctuations from bulk measurements, a feat previously believed to be impossible. Overall, the newly discovered universality reported herein offers a powerful tool for predicting the impact of perturbations on kinetic processes, and for inferring underlying fluctuations from response measurements.</p>

            <p>We apply various unsupervised machine learning methods for phase classification to investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model in two dimensions. Using only particle occupation snapshots from Monte Carlo simulations as input, each technique, including a straightforward classification based on principal component analysis (PCA), successfully identifies the phase boundary between ordered and disordered phases, independent of the type of phase transition. Remarkably, these techniques also distinguish between the weakly localized and Anderson-localized regimes within the disordered phase, accurately identifying their crossover, which is a challenging task for standard methods. Among the machine learning approaches used, PCA based analysis outperforms more complex methods, such as neural network predictors and autoencoders. These results underscore the effectiveness of simple unsupervised techniques in examining phase transitions and electron localization in complex correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Symmetry breaking in a layered superconductor with Ising spin-orbit coupling has offered an opportunity to realize unconventional superconductivity. To be more specific, orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, exhibiting layer-dependent finite-momentum pairing, may emerge in transition metal dichalcogenides materials (TMDC) in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Orbital FFLO state can be more robust against the magnetic field than the conventional superconducting state with zero-momentum pairing. This feature renders its potential in field-resilient superconducting functionality. Although, orbital FFLO state has been reported in NbSe2 and MoS2, it is not yet clear if orbital FFLO state can be extended to other TMDC superconductor. Here, we report the observation of orbital FFLO state in 2H-NbS2 flakes and its dependence on the thickness of flake. We conclude that the relatively weak interlayer coupling is instrumental in stabilizing orbital FFLO state at higher temperature with respect to the critical temperature and lower magnetic field with respect to paramagnetic limit in NbS2 in comparison to its NbSe2 counterpart.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guy Gabrieli, Yair Shokef, Izhar Neder</p>
            <p>We derive an Ito-Langevin stochastic process that captures the time-dependent deviation from Poisson behavior of the noise detected from a general heterogeneous sub-critical neutron system. Using the probability generating function for the actual physical process, we deduce the super-Poisson deviation of the covariance matrix of counts at the detector due to neutron multiplication upon fission. This leads to a general form that coincides with the second moment of an Ito process. This comparison facilitates the formulation of a corresponding effective Langevin equation, which potentially enables simulations that significantly reduce the computational resources required compared to direct simulation of the system's actual noise. This method could assist in designing sub-critical noise experiments for licensing new research reactors, for improving cross-section libraries and for non-destructive assays of spent fuel.</p>

            <p>When a turbulent Bose-Einstein condensate is driven out-of-equilibrium at a scale much smaller than the system size, nonlinear wave interactions transfer particles towards large scales in an inverse cascade process. In this work, we study numerically wave turbulence in a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in forced and dissipated inverse cascade settings. We observe that when the forcing rate increases, thereby increasing the particle flux, the turbulence spectrum gradually transitions from the weak-wave Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade to a critical balance state characterized by a range of scales with balanced linear and nonlinear dynamic timescales. Further forcing increases lead to a coherent condensate component superimposed with Bogoliubov-type acoustic turbulence. We then use our predictions and numerical data to formulate a new out-of-equilibrium equation of state for the 3D inverse cascade.</p>

            <p>Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</p>

            <p>In this work we propose a simple phenomenological model for magnetization curves of stressed samples. The effect of stress is introduced by scaling the arctangent function argument (magnetic field) proportionally to stress. The magnetization curve is modelled by one or two arctangent functions. Despite of its simplicity, the model gives a very good agreement with experimental curves, reproducing all stress-induced features usually observed on the magnetization curves including the common crossover point and constricted hysteresis loops. The popular effective field concept in this model is just a consequence of a simple scaling of the magnetic field. We show that the differential susceptibility is inversely proportional to the applied stress for all magnetization values. We propose to analyze the field and differential susceptibility as a function of magnetization in contrast to convenient M(H) loops.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport theory for unconventional magnets: Interplay of altermagnetism and p-wave magnetism with superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Kokkeler, Ilya Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret</p>
            <p>We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hana Schiff, Paul McClarty, Jeffrey G. Rau, Judit Romhanyi</p>
            <p>Altermagnets exhibit spontaneously spin-split electronic bands in the zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC) limit arising from the presence of collinear compensated magnetic order. The distinctive magneto-crystalline symmetries of altermagnets ensure that these spin splittings have a characteristic anisotropy in crystal momentum space. These systems have attracted a great deal of interest due to their potential for applications in spintronics. In this paper, we provide a general Landau theory that encompasses all three-dimensional altermagnets where the magnetic order does not enlarge the unit cell. We identify all crystal structures that admit altermagnetism and then reduce these to a relatively small set of distinct possible Landau theories governing such systems. In the zero SOC limit, we determine the possible local multipolar orders that are tied to the spin splitting of the band structure. We make precise the connection between altermagnetism as defined at zero SOC ("ideal" altermagnets) and the effects of weak SOC. In particular, we examine which response functions allowed by symmetry when SOC is present are guaranteed by the spin-orbit free theory, and spell out the distinctive properties of altermagnets in comparison with conventional collinear antiferromagnets. Finally, we show how these ideas can be applied by considering a number of altermagnetic candidate materials.</p>

            <p>The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) based on density functional theory (DFT) provides a powerful mechanism for computing and probing the microscopic features of elastic tensor-related properties.

For the first time, we have mapped the heterogeneity in elastic constants and shear modulus and associated relaxation fields at each lattice site by computing the force response internal strain tensor ($\Lambda$) and displacement response internal strain tensors ($\Gamma$). Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy pressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all refractory binaries. The computed mechanical properties data for the refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.</p>

            <p>We study transport in spin chains employing the Thouless approach based on the level sensitivity to the boundary conditions, $R$. Although spin transport in the integrable easy-axis XXZ model is diffusive, corresponding $R$ is much closer to ballistic chains than to chaotic diffusive systems. In the case of the grand canonical ensemble, this observation can be rigorously justified, while in the case of the canonical ensemble it can be demonstrated by numerical calculations. Integrability breaking perturbation (IBP) strongly reduces $R$ which reveals a pronounced minimum at the crossover from anomalous diffusive to normal dissipative transport. This minimum coincides with the onset of the universality of the random matrix theory. Results for various IBP suggest a discontinuous jump of the spin conductivity in the thermodynamic limit, and moreover that its value is proportional to the strength of the IBP.</p>

            <p>Periodically driven systems have a longstanding reputation for establishing rich topological phenomena beyond their static counterpart. In this work, we propose and investigate a periodically driven extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with three sites per unit cell, obtained by replacing the Pauli matrices with their $3\times 3$ counterparts. The system is found to support a number of edge modes over a range of parameter windows, some of which have no static counterparts. Among these edge modes, of particular interest are those which are pinned at a specific quasienergy value. Such quasienergy-fixed edge modes arise due to the interplay between topology and chiral symmetry, which are typically not expected in a three-band static model due to the presence of a bulk band at the only chiral-symmetric energy value, i.e., zero. In our time-periodic setting, another chiral-symmetric quasienergy value exists at half the driving frequency, which is not occupied by a bulk band and could then host chiral-symmetry-protected edge modes ($\pi$ modes). Finally, we verify the robustness of all edge modes against spatial disorder and briefly discuss the prospect of realizing our system in experiments.</p>

Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works universally for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.</p>

In these theories, the flat bands display a sizable increase of the bandwidth, suggesting the renormalization of the magic angle. Additionally, the corresponding wavefunctions flow towards the limit of perfect particle-hole symmetry and sublattice polarization (the 'chiral' limit). We further represent the flat bands in the 'vortex Chern' basis and discuss the implications on the dynamics, regarding the 'flat' and 'chiral' symmetries of MATBG, as manifested in the symmetry-broken states at neutrality.</p>

            <p>The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$-plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$-plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</p>

            <p>Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.</p>

            <p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines and those enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-masses for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of data analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</p>

            <h2>Valley Gapless Semiconductor: Models and Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kok Wai Lee, Pei-Hao Fu, Jun-Feng Liu, Ching Hua Lee, Yee Sin Ang</p>
            <p>The emerging field of valleytronics harnesses the valley degree of freedom of electrons, akin to how electronic and spintronic devices utilize the charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons respectively. The engineering of valleytronic devices typically relies on the coupling between valley and other degrees of freedom such as spin, giving rise to valley-spintronics where an external magnetic field manipulates the information stored in valleys. Here, the valley gapless semiconductor is proposed as a potential electrically controlled valleytronic platform because the valley degree of freedom is coupled to the carrier type, i.e., electrons and holes. The valley degree of freedom can be electrically controlled by tuning the carrier type via the device gate voltage. We demonstrate the proposal for realizing a valley gapless semiconductor in the honeycomb lattice with the Haldane and modified Haldane models. The system's valley-carrier coupling is further studied for its transport properties in an all-electrically controlled valley filter device setting. Our work highlights the significance of the valley gapless semiconductor for valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a novel systematic construction of gapped domain walls (GDWs) within the Levin-Wen (LW) model. By gluing two LW models along their open sides in a compatible way, we achieve a complete GDW classification by subsets of bulk input data, which encompass the classifications in terms of bimodule categories. A generalized bimodule structure is introduced to capture domain-wall excitations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that folding along any GDW yields a gapped boundary (GB) described by a Frobenius algebra of the input UFC for the folded model, thus bridging our GDW classification and the GB classification in \cite{hu2018boundary}.</p>

            <h2>Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Sahbani, Swetamber Das, Jason R. Green</p>
            <p>Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a ``maximally mixed'' classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.</p>

            <h2>Memorization and Generalization in Generative Diffusion under the Manifold Hypothesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatrice Achilli, Luca Ambrogioni, Carlo Lucibello, Marc Mézard, Enrico Ventura</p>
            <p>We study the memorization and generalization capabilities of Diffusion Models (DMs) when data lies on a structured latent manifold. Specifically, we consider a set of $P$ data points in $N$ dimensions confined to a latent subspace of dimension $D = \alpha_D N$, following the Hidden Manifold Model (HMM). We analyze the reverse diffusion process using the empirical score function as a proxy, and characterize it in the high-dimensional limit $P = \exp(\alpha N)$, $N \gg 1$, by exploiting a connection with the Random Energy Model (REM). We show that a characteristic time $t_o$ marks the emergence of traps in the time-dependent potential, which however do not affect typical trajectories. The size of their basins of attraction is computed at all times. We derive the collapse time $t_c < t_o$, at which trajectories fall into the basin of a training point, signaling memorization. An explicit formula for $t_c$ as a function of $P$ and $\alpha_D$ shows that the curse of dimensionality is avoided for structured data ($\alpha_D \ll 1$), even with nonlinear manifolds. We also prove that collapse corresponds to the condensation transition in the REM. Generalization is quantified via the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the exact distribution and the reverse one at time $t$. We find a distinct time $t_g < t_c < t_o$ minimizing this divergence. Surprisingly, the best generalization occurs inside the memorization phase. We conclude that generalization in DMs improves with data structure, as $t_g \to 0$ faster than $t_c$ when $\alpha_D \to 0$.</p>

            <h2>Finite-rate quench in disordered Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Nan Du, Zhao Liu</p>
            <p>We study the quantum quench of a finite rate across topological quantum transitions in two-dimensional Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators. We choose the representative Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model to investigate the behavior of excitation density generated by the quench and the impact of disorder on it. For the Haldane model, as long as the spectral gap is not closed by disorder, we find the excitation density at the end of the quench obeys the power-law decay with decreasing quench rate, and the power is consistent with the prediction of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By contrast, the Kibble-Zurek scaling of excitation density is absent in the Kane-Mele model once disorder is switched on, which we attribute to the emergence of a disorder-induced gapless region. In particular, the anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior of excitation density, namely, larger excitation density at slower quench, is observed at suitable model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that particle's onsite occupation can be used as a local measurable quantity to probe the breakdown of adiabatic evolution. The difference of onsite occupation between the time-evolved state and instantaneous ground state at the end of the quench can successfully capture the key features of excitation density for both the Haldane and Kane-Mele models under periodic and more realistic open boundary conditions, thus facilitating the experimental characterization of the quench dynamics in these models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Lacerda-Santos, Xavier Waintal</p>
            <p>In quantum nanoelectronics devices, the electrostatic energy is the largest energy scale at play and, to a large extend, it determines the charge distribution inside the devices. Here, we introduce the Pure Electrostatic Self consistent Approximation (PESCA) that provides a minimum model that describes how to include a semiconductor in an electrostatic calculation to properly account for both screening and partial depletion due to e.g. field effect. We show how PESCA may be used to reconstruct the charge distribution from the measurement of pinch-off phase diagrams in the gate voltages space. PESCA can also be extended to account for magnetic field and calculate the edge reconstruction in the quantum Hall regime. The validity of PESCA is controlled by a small parameter $\kappa = C_g/C_q$, the ratio of the geometrical capacitance to the quantum capacitance, which is, in many common situations, of the order of 1%, making PESCA a quantitative technique for the calculation of the charge distribution inside devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elizaveta Demyanenko, Davide Straziota, Carlo Baldassi, Carlo Lucibello</p>
            <p>We consider random instances of non-convex perceptron problems in the high-dimensional limit of a large number of examples $M$ and weights $N$, with finite load $\alpha = M/N$. We develop a formalism based on replica theory to predict the fundamental limits of efficiently sampling the solution space using generative diffusion algorithms, conjectured to be saturated when the score function is provided by Approximate Message Passing. For the spherical perceptron with negative margin $\kappa$, we find that the uniform distribution over solutions can be efficiently sampled in most of the Replica Symmetric region of the $\alpha-\kappa$ plane. In contrast, for binary weights, sampling from the uniform distribution remains intractable. A theoretical analysis of this obstruction leads us to identify a potential $U(s) = -\log(s)$, under which the corresponding tilted distribution becomes efficiently samplable via diffusion. Moreover, we show numerically that an annealing procedure over the shape of this potential yields a fast and robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling the solution space of the binary perceptron.</p>

            <p>Effects of the three-dimensional (3D) interplanar coupling on centrosymmetric skyrmion crystal (SkX) formation is investigated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations on the frustrated isotropic Heisenberg model on a stacked-triangular lattice in both cases of the ferromagnetic (F) and the antiferromagnetic (AF) nearest-neighbor interplanar coupling $J_{1c}$. The SkX phase is stabilized at finite fields and at finite temperatures for both F and AF $J_{1c}$, although it is destabilized by modestly weak AF $J_{1c}$. The magnetic phase diagram of the 3D short-range model is more or less similar to those of the 2D short-range model and of the 2D long-range RKKY model. We find that an intriguing phenomenon of replica-symmetry breaking, popular in glass physics and recently identified in the SkX phase of the 3D long-range RKKY model [K. Mitsumoto and H. Kawamura, Phys. Rev.

            <p>The study of the long-time dynamics of quantum systems can be a real challenge, especially in systems like ultracold gases, where the required timescales may be longer than the lifetime of the system itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to access the long-time dynamics of a strongly repulsive atomic gas mixture in shorter times. The shortcut-to-dynamics protocol that we propose does not modify the fate of the observables, but effectively jumps ahead in time without changing the system's inherent evolution.

            <p>Long considered the ''poor cousins'' of spin-1/2 systems, magnets built of spin-1 moments have recently come to fore as a rich source of novel phases of matter. Here we explore the phases which arise in a spin-1 magnet on the pyrochlore lattice, once biquadratic interactions are taken into account. Using a combination of variational and Monte Carlo techniques, built around the exact treatment of spin-1 at the level of a single site, we uncover seven distinct spin liquid phases. Dynamical calculations for one of these spin liquids are shown to be in good agreement with inelastic neutron scattering on the spin-1 pyrochlore $\mathrm{NaCaNi}_2\mathrm{F}_7$. These results suggest that the range of spin liquid phases found in spin-1 pyrochlores may be even richer than in materials with (pseudo-)spin-1/2 moments.</p>

            <p>A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</p>

Given the knowledge of these Lanczos coefficients, the method is very cheap. Usually accuracy increases with more Lanczos coefficients taken into account, however, we numerically find and analytically argue that the convergence is rather quick, if the Lanczos coefficients exhibit a smoothly increasing structure. For pertinent examples we compare with data from dynamical typicality computations for large but finite systems and find good agreement if few Lanczos coefficients are taken into account. From the method it is evident that in these cases the correlation functions are well described by a low number of damped oscillations.</p>

            <p>U(1) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase is studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations that have finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl Bergson Hallberg, Erik Wegner Hodt, Jacob Linder</p>
            <p>When a charge current is injected into an altermagnet along a suitable crystallographic direction, a transverse spin current can be generated. This so-called spin-splitter effect does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, and is thus distinct from the spin Hall effect. The spin-splitter effect was predicted by \textit{ab initio} calculations and has been experimentally confirmed. To utilize the spin-splitter effect for practical purposes in spintronic devices, it is important to understand (i) how the system parameters affect the transverse spin current, such as filling fraction, altermagnetic strength, interface parameters, spin-orbit interactions, and impurities and (ii) determine the properties of any associated spin accumulation, which is the measurable quantity. Here, we determine the answer to these questions and provide a real-space visualization of the spin flow and spin accumulation due to the spin-splitter effect. We utilize the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function method on a 2D square lattice to this end. We find that the presence of edges induces oscillations in the spin accumulation and strongly modify the signal for small samples. At half-filling, the spin accumulation acquires an anomalous pattern and the spin-splitter effect vanishes. We prove analytically that this follows from a combined particle-hole and spin-reversal symmetry of the model used for the altermagnetic state. Increasing the altermagnetic strength leads to a larger spin accumulation, as expected. However, when adding Rashba spin-orbit interaction, providing an additional spin Hall signal, we find that the spin accumulation is not simply the sum of the spin Hall and spin-splitter contribution. Finally, we show that the spin-splitter effect is robust towards moderate impurity scattering with a potential of the same order as the hopping parameter, which facilitates its observation in real materials.</p>

            <p>Activity and renewability are distinctive features of living matter, and constitute a new class of materials that we term renewable active matter. A striking example is the cell cytoskeleton, where myosin filaments bind to the actin meshwork, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual stress/strain dependent turnover, thus acting as both force generators and sensors. As a consequence of nonreciprocity, arising from the independence of action and response, such living matter exhibits unusual mechanical properties like, segregation without attraction, fragility and force chains. Here we show that the interplay between activity and turnover gives rise to mechanical excitability in the form of travelling waves and pulses, and spatiotemporal chaos. We provide a systematic study of the nucleation, movement and shape of the travelling pulse, and present a boundary layer analysis to establish the existence of homoclinic orbits. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical analysis of the governing partial differential equations. This study has implications for the observed mechanical excitability in a variety of cellular contexts such as in isolated adherent cells and confluent cells within tissues.</p>

Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by preserved rotational $SO(2)$ symmetry, broken time-reversal symmetry, nontrivial vortex-line excitations, and topological gapless edge surface states. We construct the associated field theory in a curved spatial geometry and analyze the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state, demonstrating its topological nature. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the scaling of the chemical potential of the CVLL ground state as a function of boson density for interacting bosons in a cylindrical moat-band geometry and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, the physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets (AMs) constitute a novel class of spin-compensated materials in which opposite-spin sublattices are connected by a crystal rotation, causing their electronic iso-energy surfaces to be spin-split. While cubic and tetragonal crystal symmetries tend to produce AMs in which the splitting of electronic iso-energy surfaces has $d$-wave symmetry, hexagonal AMs, such as CrSb and MnTe, are $g$-wave AMs. Here we investigate the purely magnetic modes and spin-textures of $g$-wave AMs and show that they are drastically different for easy-axial (CrSb) and easy-planar (MnTe) materials. We show that in CrSb the splitting of the chiral magnon branches possesses $g$-wave symmetry, with each branch carrying a fixed momentum-independent magnetic moment. The altermagnetic splitting is not affected by the easy-axial anisotropy and is the same as that in the nonrelativistic limit. The magnon splitting of MnTe, however, does not strictly possess $g$-wave symmetry due to its easy-planar anisotropy. Instead, the magnetic moment of each branch becomes momentum-dependent, with a distribution that is of $g$-wave symmetry. To generalize the concept of the altermagnetic splitting beyond the nonrelativistic limit, we introduce alternative, directly observable splitting parameter which comprises both the magnon eigenenergy and its magnetic moment and possesses the $g$-wave symmetry in both easy-axial and easy-planar cases. The associated altermagnetic domain walls in easy-axial CrSb possess a net magnetization with an amplitude that depends on their orientation.</p>

            <p>Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials, especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride (BiH$_2$), successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase $P2_1/m$-BiH$_2$ exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) of 70 K among MH$_2$-type hydride apart from H$_2$S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for $P2_1/m$- and $C2/m$-BiH$_2$ indicate that the upper critical fields $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$ = 12--16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar $T_c$. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH$_2$, about $1.1 \times 10^6$ m/s, which allows to classify BiH$_2$ as a 'soft' molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current-voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum $J_c(0) = 10$ kA/mm$^2$), which indicates the presence of two $s$-wave superconducting gaps in BiH$_2$ at 172--176 GPa: $\Delta_L(0) = 6.9 \pm 1.2$ meV and $\Delta_S(0) \sim 1.5$ meV.</p>

            <h2>Triplet Excitons Reconcile Charge Generation and Recombination in Low-Offset Organic Solar Cells: Efficiency Limits from a 5-State Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan L. Langentepe-Kong, Manasi Pranav, Safa Shoaee, Dieter Neher</p>
            <p>The power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells has recently improved beyond 20%. The active layers of these devices comprise of at least two organic semiconductors, forming a type II heterojunction. Hereby, the device performance is determined by the kinetic interplay of various species, including localized excitons, charge transfer states as well as charge-separated states. However, a model which describes all relevant photovoltaic measures has yet to be developed. Herein, we present a comprehensive 5-state rate model which includes both singlet and triplet charge transfer states and takes into account the formation, re-splitting and decay of the local triplet state, parametric in the respective energy offset. We show that this model not only describes key device properties such as charge generation efficiency, photoluminescence, electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor simultaneously but also elucidate how these vary across material combinations based on the D:A interfacial energy offset alone. We find that the electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor depend strongly on the triplet properties and that the triplet decay becomes the dominant charge recombination pathway for systems with moderate offset, in full agreement to previous experimental results. Validation against literature data demonstrates the model's ability to predict the device efficiency accurately. Subsequently, we identify material combinations with singlet exciton to charge transfer state energetic offset of roughly 150meV as particularly promising. Our model explains further why recent certified efficiency records for binary blends remain at ca. 20% if no further means to improve photon and charge carrier harvesting are taken.</p>

            <h2>Sliding Friction of Hard Sliders on Rubber: Theory and Experiment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Xu, B.N.J. Persson</p>
            <p>We present a study of sliding friction for rigid triangular steel sliders on soft rubber substrates under both lubricated and dry conditions. For rubber surfaces lubricated with a thin film of silicone oil, the measured sliding friction at room temperature agrees well with theoretical predictions obtained from a viscoelastic model originally developed for rolling friction. On the lubricated surface, the sliding friction is primarily due to bulk viscoelastic energy dissipation in the rubber. The model, which includes strain-dependent softening of the rubber modulus, accurately predicts the experimental friction curves. At lower temperatures ($T = -20^\circ {\rm C}$ and $-40^\circ {\rm C}$), the measured friction exceeds the theoretical prediction. We attribute this increase to penetration of the lubricant film by surface asperities, leading to a larger adhesive contribution. For dry surfaces, the adhesive contribution becomes dominant. By subtracting the viscoelastic component inferred from the lubricated case, we estimate the interfacial frictional shear stress. This shear stress increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the sliding speed, consistent with stress-augmented thermal activation mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Majorana vortex phases in time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators and topologically trivial insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun-Jiang Luo</p>
            <p>Majorana vortex phases have been extensively studied in topological materials with conventional superconducting pairing. Inspired by recent experimental progress in realizing time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators (THOTIs) and inducing superconducting proximity effects, we investigate Majorana vortex phases in these systems. We construct THOTIs as two copies of a topological insulator (TI) with time-reversal symmetry-preserving mass terms that anisotropically gap the surface states. We find that these mass terms have a negligible impact on the vortex phase transitions of double TIs when treated as perturbations, and no additional topological phase transitions are induced. Consequently, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) emerge when the chemical potential lies between the critical chemical potentials $\mu_c^{(1)}$ and $\mu_c^{(2)}$ of the two TI vortex phase transitions. We demonstrate this behavior across multiple THOTI models, including rotational symmetry-protected THOTI, inversion symmetry-protected THOTI, rotational and inversion symmetries-protected THOTI bismuth, and extrinsic THOTI. Remarkably, MVEMs persist even when all surfaces are gapped with the same sign, rendering the system topologically trivial in both first- and second-order classifications. Our findings establish that MVEMs can be realized in time-reversal invariant systems with fully gapped surfaces, encompassing both topologically nontrivial and trivial insulators, thus significantly broadening the solid state material platforms for hosting Majorana vortex phases.</p>

            <h2>Strong Topological Trivialization of Multi-Species Spherical Spin Glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brice Huang, Mark Sellke</p>
            <p>We study the landscapes of multi-species spherical spin glasses. Our results determine the phase boundary for annealed trivialization of the number of critical points, and establish its equivalence with a quenched strong topological trivialization property. Namely in the "trivial" regime, the number of critical points is constant, all are well-conditioned, and all approximate critical points are close to a true critical point. As a consequence, we deduce that Langevin dynamics at sufficiently low temperature has logarithmic mixing time. Our approach begins with the Kac--Rice formula. We characterize the annealed trivialization phase by explicitly solving a suitable multi-dimensional variational problem, obtained by simplifying certain asymptotic determinant formulas from (Ben Arous--Bourgade--McKenna 2023, McKenna 2024). To obtain more precise quenched results, we develop general purpose techniques to avoid sub-exponential correction factors and show non-existence of approximate critical points. Many of the results are new even in the 1-species case.</p>

            <h2>The Fate of Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilles Parez, William Witczak-Krempa</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</p>

            <h2>Protein-DNA Co-condensation is Prewetting to a Collapsed Polymer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mason N. Rouches, Benjamin B. Machta</p>
            <p>The three-dimensional organization of chromatin is thought to play an important role in controlling gene expression. Specificity in expression is achieved through the interaction of transcription factors and other nuclear proteins with particular sequences of DNA. At unphysiological concentrations many of these nuclear proteins can phase-separate in the absence of DNA, and it has been hypothesized that, in vivo, the thermodynamic forces driving these phases help determine chromosomal organization. However it is unclear how DNA, itself a long polymer subject to configurational transitions, interacts with three-dimensional protein phases. Here we show that a long compressible polymer can be coupled to interacting protein mixtures, leading to a generalized prewetting transition where polymer collapse is coincident with a locally stabilized liquid droplet. We use lattice Monte-Carlo simulations and a mean-field theory to show that these phases can be stable even in regimes where both polymer collapse and coexisting liquid phases are unstable in isolation, and that these new transitions can be either abrupt or continuous. For polymers with internal linear structure we further show that changes in the concentration of bulk components can lead to changes in three-dimensional polymer structure. In the nucleus there are many distinct proteins that interact with many different regions of chromatin, potentially giving rise to many different Prewet phases. The simple systems we consider here highlight chromatin's role as a lower-dimensional surface whose interactions with proteins are required for these novel phases.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Fluctuation Relations in UNO</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Sidajaya, Jovan Hsuen Khai Low, Clive Cenxin Aw, Valerio Scarani</p>
            <p>In the last two decades, fluctuation theorems have been proved formally and demonstrated experimentally for several variables (such as entropy production, work, or flux) and different noises causing the fluctuations (of either thermal or other origin; Markovian or non-Markovian). Here we report the observation of a detailed fluctuation relation in a statistical process outside thermodynamics and physics: the card game UNO. As the fluctuating variable, we consider the number of steps $W$ needed for one player's deck to change from $x$ to $y$ number of cards. The other players and the remaining cards play the role of a finite non-Markovian bath. Numerical simulations of runs of the game show that $W$ obeys a fluctuation relation analogous to Crooks' theorem. While the observed behavior shares some common features with infinite random walks, it also exhibits deviations that are clear signatures of non-Markovianity and the finiteness of the bath: Notably, the parameter corresponding to temperature depends strongly on the transition $x\rightarrow y$. Our paper contributes to extending the scope of fluctuation theorems beyond their usual thermodynamic setting.</p>

            <h2>Effective field theories of dissipative fluids with one-form symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreya Vardhan, Sašo Grozdanov, Samuel Leutheusser, Hong Liu</p>
            <p>A system with a one-form global symmetry at finite temperature can be viewed as a dissipative fluid of string-like objects. In this work, we classify and construct the most general effective field theories for hydrodynamics of such string fluids, in a probe limit where the one-form charge density is decoupled from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that at leading order in the derivative expansion, there are two distinct types of diffusive transport in a string fluid depending on the discrete spacetime symmetries present in it. One particular application of interest is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effective field theories describe the diffusion of magnetic field lines. Due to the distinction between the effective field theories for different discrete symmetries, we show that the MHD of a fluid with charge conjugation symmetry is qualitatively different from that of a neutron star, which we previously discussed in arXiv:2207.01636. The explicit effective actions that we write down can be used to obtain the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ up to cubic order in momenta for each of the different discrete symmetry choices. As another application of this formalism, we show that when the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken, the effective action reduces to the Maxwell theory. This confirms the interpretation of the photon as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a one-form symmetry.</p>

            <p>We investigate the optimization of quantum control from a differential geometric perspective. In our approach, optimal control minimizes the cost associated with evolving a quantum state, with the cost quantified by the length of the trajectory on a relevant Riemannian manifold. We demonstrate the optimization protocol in systems with SU(2) and SU(1,1) dynamical symmetries, which encompass a broad range of physical systems. In these systems, the time evolution can be represented by trajectories on a three-dimensional manifold. Given the initial and final states, the minimum-cost quantum control corresponds to a geodesic on the manifold. When the trajectory between the initial and final states is specified, the minimum-cost control corresponds to a geodesic within a submanifold embedded in the three-dimensional space. This framework provides a geometric method for optimizing shortcuts to adiabatic driving.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ohad Vilk, Mauro Mobilia, Michael Assaf</p>
            <p>There is mounting evidence that species interactions often involve long-term memory, with highly-varying waiting times between successive events and long-range temporal correlations. Accounting for memory undermines the common Markovian assumption, and dramatically impacts key ingredients of population dynamics including birth, foraging, predation, and competition processes. Here, we study a critical aspect of population dynamics, namely non-Markovian multi-species competition. This is done in the realm of the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors (zRPS) model that is broadly used in the life sciences to metaphorically describe cyclic competition between three interacting species. We develop a general non-Markovian formalism for multi-species dynamics, allowing us to determine the regions of the parameter space where each species dominates. In particular, when the dynamics are Markovian, the waiting times are exponentially distributed and the fate of the zRPS model in large well-mixed populations is encoded in a remarkably simple condition, often referred to as the ``law of the weakest'' (LOW), stating that the species with the lowest growth rate is the most likely to prevail. We show that the survival behavior and LOW of the zRPS model are critically affected by non-exponential waiting times, and especially, by their coefficient of variation. Our findings provide key insight into the influence of long waiting times on non-Markovian evolutionary processes.</p>

Focusing on the ensemble-averaged field, we derive an exact expression for the average Green's function in the presence of finite temporal disorder, and extend the analysis to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to spatial disorder, causality prevents recurrent scattering, allowing us to achieve a non-perturbative solution. We introduce an effective medium description providing a simple analysis of the propagation regimes. Our findings offer new insights into wave dynamics in temporally disordered media, with potential applications in time-varying metamaterials, dynamic sensing, and imaging in turbulent or chaotic environments.</p>

MolMiner supports conditional generation of molecules over twelve properties, enabling flexible control across physicochemical and structural targets.

A probabilistic conditioning mechanism allows users to specify any subset of target properties while sampling the rest. MolMiner achieves calibrated conditional generation across most properties and offers competitive unconditional performance. We also propose improved benchmarking methods for both unconditional and conditional generation, including distributional comparisons via Wasserstein distance and calibration plots for property control. To our knowledge, this is the first model to unify dynamic geometry, symmetry handling, order-agnostic fragment-based generation, and high-dimensional multi-property conditioning.</p>

            <p>We explore the interplay between Berry curvature and topological properties in single-flavor color superconductors, where quarks form spin-one Cooper pairs. By deriving a new relation, we connect the topological nodal structure of the gap function in momentum space to the (nonabelian) Berry flux associated with paired quarks. This generalizes the early work by Li and Haldane [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 067003 (2018)] to systems with additional internal quantum numbers, such as color. In the ultrarelativistic limit, we uncover rich topological structures driven by the interplay of spin, chirality, and color. Specifically, we identify chirality-induced topological nodes in the transverse (opposite chirality pairing) polar and A phases. In contrast, the color-spin-locking phase lacks these nodes due to a nontrivial color Berry flux, which in turn induces gapless excitations with total Berry monopole charges of $\pm 3/2-$differing from conventional Weyl fermions. Our findings can be potentially extended to other fermionic systems carrying additional internal degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Used extensively in sensing applications, the application of solution-state electrochemiluminescent devices (ECLDs) in lighting and displays has been constrained by their low luminance and short operational lifetime. Here, we report a record improvement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) and demonstrate its use in a calligraphic display. We use the double-decker arrangement assumed by the electron donor and acceptor segments of the molecule TpAT-tFFO to realize thermally activated delayed fluorescence from an electrogenerated charge-transfer (CT) excimer state and a subsequent energy transfer to the rubrene emitter TBRb. ECLDs based on this strategy achieve an unprecedented luminance of >6,200 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime is more than 10-fold longer than all previous ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between excimer and emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF; spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with energy gaps < 0.4 eV operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. Our findings highlight the potential of ECiHF for improving ECLDs and pave the way to commercial applications of this form of fluid light.</p>

            <p>A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.</p>

To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_\kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_\kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities.

            <p>Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) are increasingly used in various applications, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, and dark matter detection. However, one important characteristic of these amplifiers, gain compression, has not received much attention. As a result, there is a lack of comprehensive experimental exploration of this phenomenon in the existing literature. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of gain compression in a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on a four-wave mixing process. We have implemented a novel setup to monitor the complex transmission of both the pump and signal tones, which allows us to simultaneously track pump depletion and signal amplification as functions of signal power and frequency across the entire bandwidth of the device. Our findings indicate that, while pump depletion occurs during gain compression, it is not the only mechanism involved in the saturation of a TWPA. Power-induced phase-matching processes also take place within the device. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing TWPAs for applications that require high total input power, such as multiplexed qubit readout or broadband photon emission.</p>

We conjecture that the ground state is degenerate and independent states are distinguished by eigenvalues of the third component of total spin operator. Each of these states can be described as a sum of paths, similar to the Motzkin paths. Moreover, there exist two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at these states. We conjecture also that these operators generate a $C$-type Lie algebra, with rank equal to the number of sites. The symmetry algebra of the Hamiltonian is actually wider, and extended, besides the cyclic shift operator, by a central element contained in the third component of total spin operator.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander L. Burin</p>
            <p>Structural defects in one-dimensional heat conductors couple longitudinal (stretching) and transverse (bending) vibrations. This coupling results in the scattering of longitudinal phonons to transverse phonons and backwards. We show that the decay rate of longitudinal phonons due to this scattering scales with their frequencies as $\omega^{3/2}$ within the long wavelength limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), which is more efficient scattering compared to the traditionally considered Rayleigh scattering within the longitudinal band ($\omega^2$). This scattering results in temperature independent thermal conductivity depending on the size as $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ for sufficiently long materials. This predicted length dependence is observed in nanowires, though the temperature dependence is seen there possibly because of deviations from pure one-dimensional behavior. The significant effect of interaction of longitudinal phonons with transverse phonons is consistent with the earlier observations of a substantial suppression of thermal energy transport by kinks, obviously leading to such interaction, though anharmonic interaction can also be significant.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-equilibrium time evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) following an inhomogeneous quench in a critical one-dimensional free fermion system. Using conformal field theory, we derive an exact expression for the SREE and analyze its behavior. We find that, at leading order in the long-time limit, the SREE grows logarithmically as $\log t$. While the equipartition of entanglement holds at leading order, we identify subleading corrections that break it. Our numerical simulations corroborate the analytical predictions with excellent agreement.</p>

            <h2>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Ramos-Fernandez, Ross S. Walker, Matthew J. Silk, Denis Boyer, Sandra E. Smith-Aguilar</p>
            <p>Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</p>

            <h2>Expedited thermalization dynamics in incommensurate systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingdi Xu, Zijun Wei, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan</p>
            <p>We study the thermalization dynamics of a quantum system embedded in an incommensurate potential and coupled to a Markovian thermal reservoir. The dephasing induced by the bath drives the system toward an infinite-temperature steady state, erasing all initial information-including signatures of localization. We find that initially localized states can relax to the homogeneous steady state faster than delocalized states. Moreover, low-temperature initial states thermalize to infinite temperature more rapidly than high-temperature states -- a phenomenon reminiscent of the Mpemba effect, in which hotter liquids freeze faster than colder ones. The slowest relaxation mode in the Liouvillian spectrum plays a critical role in the expedited thermalization for localized or cold initial states. Our results reveal that the combination of disordered structure and environmental dissipation may lead to non-trivial thermalization behavior, which advances both the conceptual framework of the Mpemba effect and the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium processes in dissipative disordered systems.</p>

            <h2>Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mario U. Gaimann, Miriam Klopotek</p>
            <p>Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Farm Size Matters: A Spatially Explicit Ecological-Economic Framework for Biodiversity and Pest Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elia Moretti, Michel Loreau, Michael Benzaquen</p>
            <p>The intensification of European agriculture, characterized by increasing farm sizes, landscape simplification and reliance on synthetic pesticides, remains a key driver of biodiversity decline. While many studies have investigated this phenomenon, they often focus on isolated elements, resulting in a lack of holistic understanding and leaving policymakers and farmers with unclear priorities. This study addresses this gap by developing a spatially explicit ecological economic model designed to dissect the complex interplay between landscape structure and pesticide application, and their combined effects on natural enemy populations and farmers' economic returns. In particular, the model investigates how these relationships are modulated by farm size (a crucial aspect frequently overlooked in prior research). By calibrating on the European agricultural sector, we explore the ecological and economic consequences of various policy scenarios. We show that the effectiveness of ecological restoration strategies is strongly contingent upon farm size. Small to medium-sized farms can experience economic benefits from reduced pesticide use when coupled with hedgerow restoration, owing to enhanced natural pest control. In contrast, large farms encounter challenges in achieving comparable economic gains due to inherent landscape characteristics. This highlights the need to account for farm size in agri-environmental policies in order to promote biodiversity conservation and agricultural sustainability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maunel Calixto, Alberto Mayorgas, Julio Guerrero</p>
            <p>Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.</p>

            <p>Magic-angle twisted multilayer graphene stands out as a highly tunable class of moiré materials that exhibit strong electronic correlations and robust superconductivity. However, understanding the relations between the low-temperature superconducting phase and the preceding correlated phases established at higher temperatures remains a challenge. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to track the formation sequence of correlated phases established by the interplay of dynamic correlations, intervalley coherence, and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG). We discover the existence of two well-resolved gaps pinned at the Fermi level within the superconducting doping range. While the outer gap, previously associated with pseudogap phase, persists at high temperatures and magnetic fields, the newly revealed inner gap is more fragile in line with superconductivity MATTG transport experiments. Andreev reflection spectroscopy taken at the same location confirms a clear trend that closely follows the doping behaviour of the inner gap, and not the outer one. Moreover, spectroscopy taken at nanoscale domain boundaries further corroborates the contrasting behavior of the two gaps, with the inner gap remaining resilient to structural variations, as expected from the finite superconducting coherence length. By comparing our findings with recent topological heavy-fermion models, we identify that the outer gap originates from the splitting of the Abrikosov-Suhl-Kondo resonance due to the breaking of the valley symmetry arising from correlation-driven effects. Our results suggest an intricate but tractable hierarchy of correlated phases in twisted multilayer graphene.</p>

            <p>We present a graphene photodetector coupled to a layer of aggregated organic semiconductor. A graphene phototransistor is covered with a thin film of merocyanine molecules. The aggregation of the molecular layer can be controlled by the deposition parameters and post-deposition annealing to obtain films ranging from amorphous to a highly aggregated state. The molecular layer has a uniaxial structure with excitonic transitions whose transition dipole moments are well defined. The presence of the molecular layer results in an enormous increase in the response of the phototransistor. We further demonstrate that the signal-enhancement is due to p-photodoping of the graphene. The spectroscopic photoresponse suggests that the photodoping via monomers and molecular aggregates takes place differently. Our photodetector is a platform to study the influence of molecular aggregation and order on charge transport processes between aggregated organic semiconductors and two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>Predicting accurate band gaps and optical properties of lower-dimensional materials, including two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials and their heterostructures, remains a challenge within density functional theory (DFT) due to their unique screening compared to their bulk counterparts. Additionally, accurate treatment of the dielectric response is crucial for developing and applying screened-exchange dielectric-dependent range-separated hybrid functionals (SE-DD-RSH) for vdW materials. In this work, we introduce a SE-DD-RSH functional to the 2D vdW materials like MoS2, WS2, hBN, black phosphorus (BP), and \b{eta}-InSe. By accounting for in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric responses, our method achieves accuracy comparable to advanced many-body techniques like G0 W0 and BSE@G0 W0 at a lower computational cost. We demonstrate improved band gap predictions and optical absorption spectra for both bulk and layered structures, including some heterostructures like MoS2/WS2 . This approach offers a practical and precise tool for exploring electronic and optical phenomena in 2D materials, paving the way for efficient computational studies of layered systems.</p>

            <p>Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. This work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground-state properties of materials using IR-active phonons.</p>

            <p>Floquet engineering has been recently recognized as an important tool for manipulating the coherent magnon-photon interaction in cavity electromagnonics systems at microwave frequencies. In spite of the novel hybrid magnonic functionalities that have been demonstrated, the effect of the Floquet drive has been relatively weak due to the limited driving efficiency, limiting its broader application. This work shows that by utilizing LC resonances, the Floquet drive in our cavity electromagnonic device can be drastically enhanced, giving rise to drastically boosted interaction between hybrid modes with fundamentally different spectral characteristics compared with previous demonstrations. In addition, the Floquet drives can also be obtained from GHz signals on such a system, allowing the demonstration of more advanced signal operations. Our novel resonance-enhanced Floquet cavity electromagnonics points to a new direction to fully unleash the potential of Floquet hybrid magnonics.</p>

            <p>The ground-state electronic spin of a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond can be used for room-temperature experiments showing coherent qubit functionality. At room temperature, photoluminescence-based qubit readout has a low single-shot fidelity; however, the populations of the qubit's two basis states can be inferred using multi-shot readout. In this work, we calculate the dependence of the error of a multi-shot inference method on various parameters of the readout process. This multi-shot readout error scales as $\Delta/\sqrt{N}$, with $N$ being the number of shots, suggesting to use the coefficient $\Delta$ as a simple multi-shot readout error benchmark. Our calculation takes into account background photons, photon loss, and initialization error. Our model enables the identification of the readout error budget, i.e., the role various imperfections play in setting the readout error. Our results enable experimentalists and engineers to focus their efforts on those hardware improvements that yield the highest performance gain for multi-shot readout.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in moire engineering provide new pathways for manipulating lattice distortions and electronic properties in low-dimensional materials. Here, we demonstrate that twisted stacking can induce dipolar vortices in metallic SrRuO3 membranes, despite the presence of free charges that would normally screen depolarizing fields and dipole-dipole interactions. These polarization vortices are correlated with moire-periodic flexoelectricity induced by shear strain gradients, and exhibit a pronounced dependence on the twist angle. In addition, multiferroic behavior emerges below the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of the films, whereby polarization and ferromagnetism coexist and compete, showing opposite twist-angle dependencies of their respective magnitudes. Density functional theory calculations provide insights into the microscopic origin of these observations. Our findings extend the scope of polarization topology design beyond dielectric materials and into metals.</p>

            <p>The altermagnet exhibits the nonrelativistic spin splitting that enables all-electrical generation of spin-polarized currents beyond the spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report on a study on the anisotropic spin-polarized conductivity in collinear altermagnets. Based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we first study this effect using the general group-theoretical analysis and identify the spin point groups sustaining the finite spin polarization defined in terms of spin-polarized conductivity. We show that the spin polarization vanishes along any direction for the $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets while the spin polarization is significantly anisotropic for the $d$-wave altermagnet. We further derive the analytical expressions for the anisotropic spin polarization in the $d$-wave altermagnets. Then, we exemplify those phenomena in several representative altermagnets based on the density functional theory calculations. Our work enriches the altermagnetic spintronics and paves the practical way to produce large spin polarization in collinear altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Phonon lasers, as their photon counterparts, rely on the physics of stimulated emission. Arguably, because light does not require a material substrate to propagate, while sound does, the impact of the two technologies has however been highly contrasting, with "sasers" (for sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) mostly remaining as an academic curiosity. This might be changing due to the possibility to use coherent sound generation for on-chip processing of information at ultra-high frequencies, and in the quantum realm, in integrated photonic and optomechanical devices. Inspired by the concept of unipolar lasers based on the quantum engineering of states in semiconductor heterostructures, we propose and implement a quantum cascade phonon laser (QCPL). A condensate of exciton-photon quasiparticles (polaritons) is optically induced in a microstructured semiconductor device to jump down a ladder of engineered levels. This down-cascade is accompanied by the efficient stimulated emission of phonons of $\sim 20$, $\sim 60$, and $\sim 100$~GHz, which are designed to strongly interact with the polaritons on the same chip. The proposed concept opens the path for the design of integrated high-frequency optomechanical devices, as for example for non-reciprocal photon transport and multi-wavelength Brillouin lasers.</p>

            <p>Perovskite microwires are promising candidates for integrated photonic systems due to their strong nonlinear optical response and inherent waveguiding capabilities. In this study, we focus on the directional emission properties of exciton-polariton condensates formed within perovskite microwires, with emphasis on emission collected from the microwire end. We constructed a multi-angle optical detection setup that allows us to identify the exciton-polariton condensation threshold and track the evolution of the condensate for different excitation position along and across the microwire. We observe spectrally narrow exciton-polariton condensate emission from the microwire end even when the condensate is generated tens of micrometers away, which demonstrates the ability of the exciton-polariton condensate to propagate over long distances within the microwire. Furthermore, we find that the presence of structural defects near the condensate location can significantly enhance the emission from the microwire end due to aligning the condensate's momentum with the waveguide direction, thereby facilitating more efficient propagation.</p>

The low-energy excitations comprise Majorana fermions propagating along the junction, coupled to the magnons in the ferromagnet. Based on mean-field and renormalization group arguments, we predict Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions in this system, both in the case of a magnetic easy-plane and weak easy-axis anisotropy. In the latter case, this is based on an emergent effective easy-plane, spanned by the easy-axis and the component of the magnetization which couples to the Majoranas. We conclude by presenting a conjecture for the full phase diagram of the model. It covers BKT transitions as well as exotic multicritical and supersymmetric points known from related models of interacting real fermions and bosons.</p>

            <p>Electrons can form an ordered solid crystal phase ascribed to the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy. Tuning these energy scales can drive a phase transition from electron solid to liquid, i.e. melting of Wigner crystal. Generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) pinned to moire superlattices have been reported by optical and scanning-probe-based methods. Using transport measurements to investigate GWCs is vital to a complete characterization, however, still poses a significant challenge due to difficulties in making reliable electrical contacts. Here, we report the electrical transport detection of GWCs at fractional fillings nu = 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 8/9, 10/9, and 4/3 in twisted bilayer MoSe2. We further observe that these GWCs undergo continuous quantum melting transitions to liquid phases by tuning doping density, magnetic and displacement fields, manifested by quantum critical scaling behaviors. Our findings establish twisted bilayer MoSe2 as a novel system to study strongly correlated states of matter and their quantum phase transitions.</p>

In one case, we derive a linear Fokker-Planck equation within a finite region, revealing a new form of both the position- and time-dependent diffusion coefficient and the corresponding continuity equation. It is noteworthy that, in both cases, the conventional result is obtained when $q$ tends to zero. Furthermore, we derive the deformed diffusion-decay equation in a finite region, also determining the position- and time-dependent decay coefficient.

            <p>We introduce a new route to Hilbert space fragmentation in high dimensions leveraging the group-word formalism. We show that taking strongly fragmented models in one dimension and "lifting" to higher dimensions using subsystem symmetries can yield strongly fragmented dynamics in higher dimensions, with subdimensional (e.g., lineonic) excitations. This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior. Meanwhile, lifting one-dimensional strongly fragmented models to higher dimensions using higher-form symmetries yields models with topologically robust weak fragmentation. In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also "mix and match" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube. We speculate that this approach could also yield a new route to non-Abelian fractons. These constructions unify a number of phenomena that have been discussed in the literature, as well as furnishing models with novel properties.</p>

            <p>It is well known that disorder can induce low-energy Andreev bound states in a sign-changing, but fully gapped, superconductor at $\pi-$junctions. Generically, these excitations are localized. Starting from a superconductor with a sign-changing and nodeless order parameter in the clean limit, here we demonstrate a mechanism for increasing the localization length associated with the low-energy Andreev bound states at a fixed disorder strength. We find that the Fubini-Study metric associated with the electronic Bloch wavefunctions controls the localization length and the hybridization between bound states localized at distinct $\pi-$junctions. We present results for the inverse participation ratio, superfluid stiffness, site-resolved and disorder-averaged spectral functions as a function of increasing Fubini-Study metric, which indicate an increased tendency towards delocalization. The low-energy properties resemble those of a dirty nodal superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov excitations. We place these results in the context of recent experiments in moire graphene superconductors.</p>

More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is pushing the limits of digital computing to such an extent that, if current trends were to continue, global energy consumption from computation alone would eclipse all other forms of energy within the next two decades. One promising approach to reduce energy consumption and to increase computational speed is in-memory analog computing. However, analog computing necessitates a fundamental rethinking of computation at the material level, where information is stored as continuously variable physical observables. This shift introduces challenges related to the precision, dynamic range, and reliability of analog devices - issues that have hindered the development of existing memory technology for use in analog computers. Here, we address these issues in the context of memory which stores information as resistance. Our approach utilizes an electrochemical cell to tune the bulk oxygen-vacancy concentration within a metal oxide film. Through leveraging the gate contact as both a heater and source of electrochemical currents, kinetic barriers are overcome to enable a dynamic range of nine decades of analog tunable resistance, more than 3,000 available states, and programming with voltages less than 2 V. Furthermore, we demonstrate deterministic write operations with high precision, current-voltage linearity across six decades, and programming speeds as fast as 15 ns. These characteristics pave the way toward low-power analog computers with potential to improve AI efficiency by orders of magnitude.</p>

            <p>We employ time-resolved optical reflectivity to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of the charge-transfer gap (CTG) in a parent cuprate compound Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (CCOC). We observe a persistent photoinduced red shift of the CTG that lasts up to 1000 ps. The red shift during the slow decay after 10 ps can be well modeled by the localized picture, whereas its maximum value at ~0.9 ps involves additional contribution from the renormalization of the Hubbard U due to screening effect from delocalized electrons. Furthermore, coupling between the mid-gap absorption and a slow acoustic phonon launches coherent oscillations below the CTG, observed as a ~20 GHz modulation with a dispersion independent of the pump fluence. These results demonstrate the tunning of the CTG by light, unveil complex interplay between multiple degrees of freedom, and contribute to a deeper understanding of superconductivity and correlated materials.</p>

            <h2>Pure nematic transition inside the superconducting dome of iron chalcogenide superconductor FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$</h2>

            <p>Nematicity and magnetism are prevalent orders in high transition temperature (Tc) superconductors, coexisting in the parent compound of most material families. Quantum fluctuations of nematicity or spin orders are both plausible candidates for mediating unconventional Cooper pairing. Identifying the sole effect of a nematic quantum critical point (QCP) on the emergence of superconducting dome without interference of spin fluctuations is therefore highly desirable. The iron chalcogenide superconductor FeSe exhibits pure nematicity without any magnetic ordering. A nematic quantum phase transition can be induced by Te substitution but experimental study of such transition is so far limited to its normal state. By performing local susceptometry on composition-spread FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ films ($0 < x < 1$) using scanning Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (sSQUID) microscopy, we investigate the superfluid density ($\rho_s$) across the pure nematic transition in extremely fine steps of ${\Delta}x$ = 0.0008. The temperature dependence of $\rho_s$ changes from the form of anisotropic pairing on the nematic side to an isotropic one across the critical doping $x_c$. The power-law dependence of gap anisotropy on $|x - x_c|$ provides evidence for nematic quantum criticality under the superconducting dome. The low-temperature $\rho_s$ scales linearly with Tc in the nematic phase $x < x_c$, whereas the gap amplitude, maximized at $x_c$, determines the Tc for $x>x_c$. Our results establish a pure nematic QCP in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$, separating two superconducting orders with distinct pairing boosted by nematic quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Pressure evolution of coplanar antiferromagnetism in heavy-fermion Ce$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$</h2>

            <p>Ce$_{2}$$M$Al$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ ($M=$ Co, Ir, Ni or Pd) are heavy-fermion materials and host a variety of ground states ranging from magnetism to non-Fermi liquid behavior. The Co, Ir, and Ni members of the series undergo magnetic ordering with decreasing transition temperatures. In contrast, the Pd compound does not magnetically order down to 0.4 K and shows non-Fermi liquid behavior, suggesting proximity to a magnetic quantum critical point. Among the series, Ce$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ orders antiferromagnetically below $T_N=1.9$ K along with heavy-fermion behavior below 15 K. We report the magnetic structure of the antiferromagnetic phase in Ce$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ and the evolution of the magnetic transition under external pressure. Rietveld refinement of the neutron diffraction data suggests a coplanar antiferromagnetic structure with a wave vector $k = (1,1,1)$ and an ordered moment of $0.383 \pm 0.018 \> \mu_B$ in the antiferromagnetic phase. Electrical resistivity and AC calorimetry measurements under hydrostatic pressure reveal a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition toward zero temperature around $p=1.1$ GPa. However, there is no evidence of non-Fermi liquid behavior associated with the suppression of magnetism by pressure, unlike the effect of transition-metal substitution.</p>

            <h2>High-pressure high-temperature solution growth, structural, and superconducting properties of Fe-substituted MgB2 single crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N.D. Zhigadlo, R. Puzniak</p>
            <p>Clarifying the impact of Fe doping on the structural and superconducting properties of MgB2 is crucial, considering that iron is commonly used as a sheath material for the fabrication of metal-clad MgB2 wires and tapes. To date the effects of Fe doping have only been investigated in polycrystalline samples, but the obtained results are controversial. Here, we report the successful growth of Mg1-xFexB2 single crystals in a quaternary Mg-Fe-B-N system using the cubic anvil high-pressure and high-temperature technique. The reaction took place in a closed boron nitride crucible at a pressure of 3 GPa and a temperature of 1960 °C. The grown crystals exhibit plate-like shapes with sizes up to 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.1 mm3. The variation of the critical temperature Tc of Mg1-xFexB2 crystals with Fe content was found to be different from that observed in polycrystalline samples. For a small Fe doping, up to x < 0.03, the behaviour of Tc(x) is similar to that for the crystals with Al and C substitutions, which suggests that Fe is in non-magnetic state. In this doping range, measurements of the temperature-dependent magnetization performed in high magnetic fields exclude spin states other than S = 0 for the Fe ions. However, for x > 0.03, certain crystals start to show a dramatic decrease in Tc, suggesting that Fe might be in a magnetic state. The M-H dependence for these crystals shows significant increase of magnetization with increasing field in low magnetic field, pointing to a weak ferromagnetism. Overall, the availability of Fe substituted MgB2 single crystals exhibiting such peculiar behaviour offers a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of disorder alone on one hand and the influence of magnetic substituent on the superconducting characteristics on the other.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Liu, Shashi B. Mishra, Jae-Mo Lihm, Samuel Poncé, Elena R. Margine</p>
            <p>Topological Weyl semimetals represent a novel class of quantum materials that exhibit remarkable properties arising from their unique electronic structure. In this work, we employ state-of-the-art ab initio methods to investigate the role of the electron-phonon interactions on the charge transport properties of TaAs. Our calculations of the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity with the iterative Boltzmann transport equation show excellent agreement with experimental measurements above 100 K. Extending the analysis to doped systems, we demonstrate that even small shifts in the Fermi level can lead to substantial changes in conductivity, driven by the complex topology of the Fermi surface. In particular, modifications in Fermi surface nesting emerge as a key factor influencing scattering processes and carrier lifetimes. These findings offer critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport in TaAs and highlight the sensitivity of Weyl semimetals to doping and carrier dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Fast and high-fidelity transfer of edge states via dynamical control of topological phases and effects of dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuuki Kanda, Yusuke Fujisawa, Kousuke Yakubo, Norio Kawakami, Hideaki Obuse</p>
            <p>Topological edge states are robust against symmetry-preserving perturbations and noise, making them promising for quantum information and computation, particularly in topological quantum computation through braiding operations of Majorana quasiparticles. Realizing these applications requires fast and high-fidelity dynamic control of edge states. In this work, we theoretically propose a high-fidelity method for transferring one-dimensional topological edge states by dynamically moving a domain wall between regions of different topological numbers. This method fundamentally relies on Lorentz invariance and relativistic effects, as moving the domain wall at a constant speed results in the problem into the uniform linear motion of a particle obeying a Dirac equation. We demonstrate effectiveness of our method in transferring edge states with high fidelity using a one-dimensional quantum walk with two internal states, which is feasible with current experimental technology. We also investigate how bit and phase-flip dissipation from environment affects transfer efficiency. Remarkably, these dissipation have minimal effects on efficiency at slow and fast transfer limits, respectively, which can be explained by relativistic effects to the edge states.</p>

            <p>Electrons can form an ordered solid crystal phase ascribed to the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy. Tuning these energy scales can drive a phase transition from electron solid to liquid, i.e. melting of Wigner crystal. Generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) pinned to moire superlattices have been reported by optical and scanning-probe-based methods. Using transport measurements to investigate GWCs is vital to a complete characterization, however, still poses a significant challenge due to difficulties in making reliable electrical contacts. Here, we report the electrical transport detection of GWCs at fractional fillings nu = 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 8/9, 10/9, and 4/3 in twisted bilayer MoSe2. We further observe that these GWCs undergo continuous quantum melting transitions to liquid phases by tuning doping density, magnetic and displacement fields, manifested by quantum critical scaling behaviors. Our findings establish twisted bilayer MoSe2 as a novel system to study strongly correlated states of matter and their quantum phase transitions.</p>

The reversible 2H$\leftrightarrow$1T$^\prime$ transition offers a tunable design space for balancing conductivity and structural stability. These findings position hybrid MoS$_2$ architectures as promising platforms for next-generation Li-S batteries with improved energy density, cycling stability, and rate capability.</p>

            <p>Reaching pressures in the 100 GPa range enables the synthesis of hydrogen-rich compounds, with nontraditional H stoichiometries and H sublattices, called superhydrides. Record-breaking superconductivity temperature in some superhydrides have attracted great interest. A crucial next step is to stabilize superhydrides outside of high-pressure environments, leading to a search beyond binary hydrides to ternary hydrides. Here, we report the synthesis of Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ at pressures starting at 60 GPa by compressing an hydrogenated Y-Fe compound, embedded in hydrogen in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction allowed us to resolve the Y$_3$Fe$_4$ lattice skeleton, and a constrained ab initio structural search was used to position the hydrogen atoms. FeH$_8$ cubic molecular units form building blocks which are connected edge-to-edge by sharing two hydrogen atoms, creating a framework that hosts Y cations. Remarkably, Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ maintains its structure through decompression, making it the first superhydride recovered metastable under ambient conditions.</p>

            <h2>Interfacial Effects Determine Nonequilibrium Phase Behaviors in Chemically Driven Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongick Cho, William M. Jacobs</p>
            <p>Coupling between chemical fuel consumption and phase separation can lead to condensation at a nonequilibrium steady state, resulting in phase behaviors that are not described by equilibrium thermodynamics. Theoretical models of such "chemically driven fluids" typically invoke near-equilibrium approximations at small length scales. However, because dissipation occurs due to both molecular-scale chemical reactions and mesoscale diffusive transport, it has remained unclear which properties of phase-separated reaction-diffusion systems can be assumed to be at an effective equilibrium. Here we use microscopic simulations to show that mesoscopic fluxes are dependent on nonequilibrium fluctuations at phase-separated interfaces. We further develop a first-principles theory to predict nonequilibrium coexistence curves, localization of mesoscopic fluxes near phase-separated interfaces, and droplet size-scaling relations in good agreement with simulations. Our findings highlight the central role of interfacial properties in governing nonequilibrium condensation and have broad implications for droplet nucleation, coarsening, and size control in chemically driven fluids.</p>

            <p>We employ first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of biphenylene supported on various metal substrates. The substrates considered are the (111) surfaces of Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Al, and the Cu$_3$Au alloy. Our results reveal how the interaction between biphenylene and the substrate governs its stability, degree of corrugation, electronic hybridization, and interfacial charge transfer. In particular, we observe a clear trend where weakly interacting metals preserve the intrinsic features of biphenylene, while more reactive substrates lead to significant structural and electronic modifications. We further evaluate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of these systems, showing that certain metal supports, especially Pd, Pt, Ag, and Cu, can enhance the catalytic performance of biphenylene. Notably, Ag and Cu combine good catalytic activity with lower cost and chemical stability, offering a promising balance for practical applications. These findings provide insights into the design of biphenylene-metal interfaces, supporting their use in next-generation electronic and catalytic devices.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) stands as one of the foremost utilized oxidizing agents in modern times. The established method for its production involves the intricate and costly anthraquinone process. However, a promising alternative pathway is the electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production, accomplished through the oxygen reduction reaction via a 2-electron pathway. This method not only simplifies the production process but also upholds environmental sustainability, especially when compared to the conventional anthraquinone method. In this review paper, recent works from the literature focusing on the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction promoted by carbon electrocatalysts are summarized. The practical applications of these materials in the treatment of effluents contaminated with different pollutants (drugs, dyes, pesticides, and herbicides) are presented. Water treatment aiming to address these issues can be achieved through advanced oxidation electrochemical processes such as electro-Fenton, solar-electro-Fenton, and photo-electro-Fenton. These processes are discussed in detail in this work and the possible radicals that degrade the pollutants in each case are highlighted. The review broadens its scope to encompass contemporary computational simulations focused on the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction, employing different models to describe carbon-based electrocatalysts. Finally, perspectives and future challenges in the area of carbon-based electrocatalysts for H2O2 electrogeneration are discussed. This review paper presents a forward-oriented viewpoint of present innovations and pragmatic implementations, delineating forthcoming challenges and prospects of this ever-evolving field.</p>

            <p>We studied a Lorentz-violating inspired Ginzburg-Landau model for superconductivity where we considered a CPT-odd contribution given by $(k_{AF})^{\mu}$, also known as the Carroll-Field-Jackiw term. In the static limit of the equations, we could find a pair of modified Ginzburg-Landau equations. Furthermore, these equations were reduced to the London equation for the magnetic field when assumed that the characteristic length of the order parameter is much smaller than the characteristic length of the magnetic field, i.e. the London penetration length. Our numerical solutions showed a simple Meissner state when this new term is small compared to $\lambda_L$ and a phase transition into phases with strong in-plane currents and anomalous vortices for large contributions. This model becomes useful in exemplifying the changes in the phenomenology of superconductors when the setup of the system shows an important breakdown of Lorentz invariance. Based on these results, we discuss how such models might be the hallmark of unusual superconducting states where there is a direction where the system shows stratification, as in anapole superconductors UTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>The bulk-boundary correspondence plays a crucial role in topological quantum systems, however,this principle is broken in non-Hermitian systems. The breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence indicates that the global phase diagrams under open boundary conditions are significantly different from those under periodic boundary conditions. In this paper, we investigate how the bulk-boundary correspondence breaks down by gradually tearing the system. We find that by tuning the strength of gain and loss domain wall, in the thermodynamic limit, the global phase diagrams of the topological system become the hybrids of those under periodic and open boundary conditions. Moreover, during the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence, several phase transitions occur. This situation is quite different from earlier work, where the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence in the thermodynamic limit occurred suddenly due to infinitesimal boundary hopping amplitudes. To support our conclusions, we provide both analytical and numerical calculations. These results help researchers better understand non-Hermitian topological systems.</p>

While GPU-based solvers currently exist, we propose a significantly more efficient machine-learning-based Fourier neural operator approach to find the solution to the GPE coupled with exciton rate equations, trained on both numerical and experimental datasets. The proposed method predicts solutions almost three orders of magnitude faster than CUDA-based solvers in numerical studies, maintaining the high degree of accuracy. Our method not only accelerates simulations but also opens the door to faster, more scalable designs for all-optical chips and devices, offering profound implications for quantum computing, neuromorphic systems, and beyond.</p>

            <p>Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components. However, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Experimental realization of strong coupling in a hybrid system remains a long-standing challenge, especially when it has multiple components and the components are of different nature. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a novel {\it polaromechanical} hybrid system, where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. The corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting is observed. A high polaromechanical cooperativity of $9.4\times10^3$ is achieved by significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via exploiting coherent perfect absorption. The quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable if placing the system at cryogenic temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.</p>

            <p>Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-on-slit (NPoS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPoS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.</p>

Given the value of the Hall conductivity, we constrain the global symmetry of the low-energy theory and its anomaly. Specifically, the one-form global symmetry and its anomaly are presented as the organizing principle of these systems. This information is powerful enough to lead to a unique minimal topological order (or a small number of minimal topological orders). Almost all of the known experimentally discovered topological orders are these minimal theories. Since this work is interdisciplinary, we made a special effort to relate to people with different backgrounds by providing translations between different perspectives.</p>

            <p>We review the basic concepts of quantum fluids of light and the different techniques that have been developed to exploit driving and dissipation to stabilize and manipulate interesting many-body states. In the weakly interacting regime, this approach has allowed to study, among other, superfluid light, non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation, photonic analogs of Hall effects, and is opening the way towards the realization of a new family of analog models of gravity. In the strongly interacting regime, the recent observations of Mott insulators and baby Laughlin fluids of light open promising avenues towards the study of novel strongly correlated many-body states.</p>

            <h2>Procedure of tuning up a three-site artificial Kitaev chain based on transmon measurements</h2>

            <p>Artificial Kitaev chains (AKCs), formed of quantum dot-superconductor linear arrays, provide a promising platform for hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs) and implementing topological quantum computing. The main challenges along this research direction would include the tuning up of AKCs for hosting MBSs and the readout of the parity of the chains. In this work, we present a step-by-step procedure for tuning up a three-site AKC to its sweet spots based on the spectra of a transmon circuit which is integrated with the chain for the purpose of reading out the parity of the chain. The signatures of the transmon's plasma modes in each step, particular those related to the appearance of MBSs in the chain, will be given. We find that the sweet spots in a three-site AKC can be classified into three types based on the relative strengths of elastic cotunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR): ECT-dominated sweet spots, genuine sweet spots and CAR-dominated sweet spots. We show that the ECT-dominated and CAR-dominated sweet spots can be more conveniently accessed and utilized in transmon-based measurements.</p>

            <p>We study the behavior of the 2D repulsive Hubbard model on a square lattice at half filling, under strong driving with ac electric fields, by employing a time-dependent Gaussian variational approach. Within the same theoretical framework, we analytically obtain the conventional Keldysh crossover between multiphoton and tunneling photoexcitation mechanisms, as well as two new regimes beyond the Keldysh paradigm. We discuss how dynamical renormalization of the Mott-Hubbard gap feeds back into the photoexcitation process, modulating the carrier generation rate in real time. The momentum distribution of quasiparticle excitations immediately after the drive is calculated, and shown to contain valuable information about the generation mechanism. Finally, we discuss experimental probing of the pump-induced nonequilibrium electronic state.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals materials have become a promising building block for future electronics and photonics. The two-dimensional magnet CrSBr came into the spotlight of solid state research due to its intriguing combination of antiferromagnetic order, strong light-matter coupling and unusual quasi-1D electronic bandstructure. This study reports the electrical excitation of excitons in CrSBr layers from cryogenic temperatures up to room temperature. By exploiting the energy transfer via tunneling electrons in a graphene tunnel junction strongly bound excitons are excited in proximate CrSBr layers. This facilitates electrically-excited emission from CrSBr crystals ranging in thickness from a bilayer up to 250 nm, in which the strong linear polarization of the electroluminescence confirms the excitonic origin. For thicker layers, clear evidence for the electrically excited emission from self-hybridized exciton polaritons is observed, highlighting the strong coupling between optical excitations and confined photon modes in CrSBr. These results pave the way for future applications in spintronic and optical readout of magnetic properties.</p>

            <h2>Fractionalized Superconductivity Mediated by Majorana Fermions in the Kitaev-Kondo Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Bunney, Urban F. P. Seifert, Stephan Rachel, Matthias Vojta</p>
            <p>Superconductivity usually emerges from a metallic normal state which follows the Fermi-liquid paradigm. If, in contrast, the normal state is a fractionalized non-Fermi liquid, then pairing may either eliminate fractionalization via a Higgs-type mechanism leading to a conventional superconducting state, or pairing can occur in the presence of fractionalization. Here we discuss a simple model for the latter case: Using a combination of perturbation theory and functional renormalization group, we show that the Kitaev--Kondo lattice model displays a fractionalized superconducting phase at weak Kondo coupling. This phase is characterized by Cooper pairing of conventional electronic quasiparticles, coexisting with a spin-liquid background and topological order. Depending on the sign of the Kitaev coupling, we find the pairing to be either of chiral $d$-wave or $p$-wave type for extended doping regions around the van-Hove filling. We discuss applications and extensions.</p>

            <p>We present a protocol to implement a spin-1 chain in Rydberg systems using three Rydberg states close to a Förster resonance. In addition to dipole-dipole interactions, strong van der Waals interactions naturally appear due to the presence of the Förster resonance and give rise to a highly tunable Hamiltonian. The resulting phase diagram is studied using the infinite density-matrix renormalization group and reveals a highly robust Haldane phase -- a prime example of a symmetry protected topological phase. We find experimentally accessible parameters to probe the Haldane phase in current Rydberg systems, and demonstrate an efficient adiabatic preparation scheme. This paves the way to probe the remarkable properties of spin fractionalization in the Haldane phase.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulation of the microscopic to macroscopic crossover using superconducting quantum impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Burshtein, Moshe Goldstein</p>
            <p>Despite being a pillar of quantum mechanics, little attention has been paid to the onset of Fermi's golden rule as a discrete microscopic bath of modes approaches the macroscopic thermodynamic limit and forms a continuum. Motivated by recent experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics, we tackle this question through the lens of single-photon decay in a finite transmission line coupled to a qubit ("quantum impurity"). We consider a single-photon state, coupled via the nonlinear impurity to several baths formed by multi-photon states with different number of photons, which are inherently discrete due to the finite size of the line. We focus on the late-time dynamics of the single-photon, and uncover the conditions under which the photon's decoherence rate approaches the decay rate predicted by Fermi's golden rule. We show that it is necessary to keep a small but finite escape rate (unrelated to the impurity) for each single-photon mode to obtain a finite long-time decay rate. We analyze the contribution of the baths formed by many-body states with different number of photons, and illustrate how the decay rate induced by some bath of $n$ photon states is enhanced by the presence of other baths of $m \neq n$ photon states, highlighting the contribution of cascade photon decay processes. Our formalism could be used to analyze recent experiments in superconducting circuits.</p>

            <h2>Synchronous manipulation of nuclear spins via boron vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fattah Sakuldee, Mehdi Abdi</p>
            <p>We develop a method for entangling operations on nuclear spins surrounding a negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-center) point defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). To this end, we propose to employ the electron spin of a VB-center as a control qubit. We show that in the presence of a background magnetic field and by applying control pulses, one can collectively manipulate the state of the nuclei with $\hat{U}_z$ and $\hat{U}_x$ rotations. These rotations can serve for implementing the synchronous three-qubit $X$, $Z$, and the Hadamard gates. Through our numerical analyses considering realistic system parameters and the decoherence effects, we demonstrate that these gates can be executed with high fidelities. Furthermore, as an example for the application of our toolbox, we utilize these collective gates to prepare the highly entangled GHZ states among the three nuclear spins with a fidelity of $0.99$. By including the electron decoherence effects, we find that the relative deviations of the gate fidelities from the noisy terms are negligibly small, proving the noise-resilience of our protocols. Our work can serve as the foundation for exploiting the nuclear spins in hBN in future quantum technological applications.</p>

            <h2>Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Campos Venuti, Jovan Odavić, Alioscia Hamma</p>
            <p>We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.</p>

            <p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are extensively employed for processing sequential data such as time series. Reservoir computing (RC) has drawn attention as an RNN framework due to its fixed network that does not require training, making it an attractive for hardware based machine learning. We establish an explicit correspondence between the well-established mathematical RC implementations of Echo State Networks and Band-pass Networks with Leaky Integrator nodes on the one hand and a physical circuit containing iontronic simple volatile memristors on the other. These aqueous iontronic devices employ ion transport through water as signal carriers, and feature a voltage-dependent (memory) conductance. The activation function and the dynamics of the Leaky Integrator nodes naturally materialise as the (dynamic) conductance properties of iontronic memristors, while a simple fixed local current-to-voltage update rule at the memristor terminals facilitates the relevant matrix coupling between nodes. We process various time series, including pressure data from simulated airways during breathing that can be directly fed into the network due to the intrinsic responsiveness of iontronic devices to applied pressures. This is done while using established physical equations of motion of iontronic memristors for the internal dynamics of the circuit.</p>

In this study, we develop a novel approach that integrates first-principles calculations with genetic algorithms to accelerate the discovery of liquid crystal polymers with low visible absorption and high refractive index. By iterating within a predefined space of molecular building blocks, our approach rapidly identifies reactive mesogens that meet target specifications. Additionally, it provides valuable insights into the relationships between molecular structure and properties. This strategy not only accelerates material screening but also uncovers key molecular design principles, offering a systematic and scalable alternative to traditional trial-and-error methods.</p>

            <h2>Quasiparticles and optical conductivity in the mixed state of Weyl superconductors with unconventional pairing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihai Liu, Luyang Wang</p>
            <p>Previous investigations have revealed that the Weyl superconductor (WeylSC) and the two-dimensional (2D) nodal superconductor, realized through a topological insulator-superconductor heterostructure, can exhibit a Dirac-like Landau level (LL) structure that scales with $\sqrt{n}$ in the presence of a vortex lattice, where $n$ is the index of the LLs. Here, we investigate the excitation spectrum in the mixed state of WeylSCs with unconventional pairing and find that, unlike in the spin-singlet case, QP bands for the spin-triplet pairing show surprising dispersion, except for the chiral symmetry-protected, dispersionless zeroth Landau level (ZLL). Different pairing symmetries in WeylSCs also result in distinct magneto-optical responses, manifested as characterized magneto-optical conductivity curves. We also reveal that, compared to the topologically protected, charge-neutral, localized Majorana zero mode (MZM), the chiral symmetry-protected ZLL is non-charge-neutral and delocalized. Both of these zero modes may be observed in the vortex of a superconductor heterostructure.</p>

Operating in this regime, we demonstrate single-photon counting at mid-infrared (11.3 microns) and visible wavelengths (675 nanometres) and temperatures up to 25 K. This detector offers new prospects for broadband, high-temperature quantum technologies with CMOS compatibility and seamless integration into photonic integrated circuits (PICs).

            <p>Spin states are pivotal in modulating the electrocatalytic activity of transition-metal (TM)-based compounds, yet quantitatively evaluating the activity-spin state correlation remains a formidable challenge. Here, we propose an 'activity index n' as a descriptor, to assess the activity of the spin states for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). n descriptor integrates three key electronic parameters: the proportion (P), broadening range (R) and center cc of active spin state, which collectively account for the electronic structure modulation induced by both the intrinsic active site and its local coordination environment. Using 1T-phase ZrSe2-anchored TM atoms (TM=Sc to Ni) as prototypes, we reveal that the correlation between Gibbs free energy and the n value follows a linear relation, namely, the vGH reduces as the n decreases. Notably, ZrSe2-Mn exhibits the optimal n value (-0.56), corresponding the best HER activity with a vGH of 0.04 eV closer to the thermoneutral ideal value (0 eV) than even Pt (vGH = -0.09 eV). This relationship suggests that n is the effective descriptor of active spin state for HER of TM-based catalysts. Our study brings fundamental insights into the HER activity-spin state correlation, offering new strategies for HER catalyst design.</p>

            <p>Monolayer V2O3, a two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator with intrinsic ferromagnetic order and a nontrivial band gap, offers a promising platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the impact of substrate selection on its electronic and topological properties. By modeling heterostructures with van der Waals (vdW) substrates, we demonstrate that non-magnetic substrates such as h-BN preserve the QAH phase with a Chern number C = 1, maintaining gapless chiral edge states. In contrast, ferromagnetic substrates induce extra electrons, destroying the topological order by shifting the Fermi level. These findings establish substrate engineering as a pivotal strategy for experimental realization of dissipationless edge transport in V2O3-based vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications as low-power topological electronics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the interplay between Zeeman splitting and TE-TM-induced spin-flip tunneling in coupled exciton-polariton condensates systems and its impact on the spin-Meissner effect. We demonstrate that although a single condensate exhibits the effect of full paramagnetic screening via spin-anisotropic interactions, the inter-site spin-flip tunneling can dramatically alter this behavior. The geometry of the system is shown to play a crucial role. In particular, in a dyad, the chemical potential reveals quadratic scaling with the magnetic field. In a triangle, the competition between Zeeman and TE-TM splittings produces a rich phase diagram that features asymmetric polarization states corresponding to both positive and negative magnetic susceptibility. In a square configuration, the symmetry of the network can restore the spin-Meissner effect, so that the condensate emission frequency becomes magnetic field independent in an extended parameter range. These findings not only shed light on the fundamental physics of polariton lattices but also suggest promising avenues for engineering robust spin-controlled photonic devices and polaritonic simulators.</p>

Such highly-controllable quantum emitters are promising candidates for future applications in quantum information technologies. We monitor the charge dynamics by resonant optical excitation and identify quantum stochastic resonance with the help of full counting statistics of tunneling events in terms of the Fano factor and extend the statistical evaluation to factorial cumulants to gain a deeper understanding of this far-reaching phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Fermionic and bosonic localized states induced by geometric frustration in the kagome lattice provide a distinctive research platform for investigating emergent exotic quantum phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Here, we report the discovery of coexisting electronic and phononic flat bands induced by geometric frustration in a novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba). The electronic flat band is located around the Fermi level and possesses a nontrivial topological invariant with Z2=1. Additionaly, we identify multiple van Hove singularities (vHS) arise from the kagome Pd d orbitals with distinct dispersion and sublattice features, including conventional, higher-order vHS and p-type, m-type vHS. Specifically, our investigation of the vibrational modes of the phononic flat band reveals that its formation originates from destructive interference between adjacent kagome lattice sites with antiphase vibrational modes. A spring-mass model of phonons is established to probe the physical mechanism of the phononic flat bands. Furthermore, the calculations of electron-phonon coupling in the XPd5 reveal superconducting ground states with critical temperatures (Tc) of 4.25 K, 2.75 K, and 3.35 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively. This work provides a promising platform to explore the Fermion-boson many-body interplay and superconducting states, while simultaneously establishing a novel analytical framework to elucidate the origin of phononic flat bands in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Using first principles techniques, we show that infrared optical response can be used to discriminate between the topological and the trivial phases of two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI). We showcase germanene and jacutingaite, of recent experimental realization, as prototypical systems where the infrared spectrum is discontinuous across the transition, due to sudden and large discretized jumps of the value of Born effective charges (up to 2). For these materials, the topological transition can be induced via the application of an external electrostatic potential in the field-effect setup. Our results are rationalized in the framework of a low-energy Kane-Mele model and are robust with respect to dynamical effects which come into play when the energy gap of the material is of the same order of the infrared active phonon frequency. In the small gap QSHI germanene, due to dynamical effects, the in-plane phonon resonance in the optical conductivity shows a Fano profile with remarkable differences in the intensity and the shape between the two phases. Instead, the large gap QSHI jacutingaite presents several IR-active phonon modes whose spectral intensities drastically change between the two phases.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as promising materials for spintronic applications due to their unique magnetic properties and tunability. Controlling ferromagnetism via external stimuli is critical for both fundamental research and device integration. In particular, modulation of magnetic anisotropy and exchange interactions through strain offers a viable pathway for functional control. Owing to their weak interlayer coupling, vdW ferromagnets exhibit pronounced sensitivity to strain, enabling effective tuning of their magnetic states. In this study, we investigate electric-field-induced magnetoelectric coupling in the above-room-temperature vdW ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ integrated on a ferroelectric PMN-PT substrate. We demonstrate that application of an electric field leads to a substantial reduction in coercive force along with dynamic reconfiguration of the magnetic domain structure. These effects are attributed to electric-field-induced modulation of the vdW interlayer gap and enhancement of the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction. Our findings reveal a strong interplay between electric fields and magnetism in vdW systems, offering a viable route toward the development of low-power, multifunctional magnetic devices. This work establishes a foundation for the electric-field control of magnetic properties in vdW ferromagnets and highlights their potential in next-generation spintronic technologies.</p>

The high-quality crystal growth and magnetism manipulation are the most essential processes. Here we develop a modified chemical vapor transport method using a feedback-regulated strategy, which provides the closed-loop control of growth temperature within +/- 0.1 degree Celsius. Single crystals of MnBi2Te4, MnBi4Te7, and MnBi6Te10 are obtained under different temperature intervals respectively, and show variable tunability on magnetism by finely tuning the growth temperatures. Specifically, the cold-end temperatures not only vary the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4, but also induce magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10. In MnBi2Te4 with optimized magnetism, quantized transport with Chern insulator state is also realized at the low field of 3.7 T. Our results provide a systematic picture for the crystal growth and the rich magnetic tunability of MBT family, providing richer platforms for the related researches combining magnetism and topological physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo Gliozzi, Federico Balducci, Taylor L. Hughes, Giuseppe De Tomasi</p>
            <p>We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for a localization transition in disordered, non-reciprocal systems to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges cluster at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which charges localize at random positions. In the dynamics of entanglement, this coincides with an area to volume law transition. For systems without boundaries, the skin effect becomes a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If dipoles or higher multipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable to arbitrary disorder. Counterintuitively, the system is therefore always delocalized under periodic boundary conditions, regardless of disorder strength.</p>

            <h2>A Strong-Coupling-Limit Study on the Pairing Mechanism in the Pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Heng Ji, Chen Lu, Zhi-Yan Shao, Zhiming Pan, Fan Yang, Congjun Wu</p>
            <p>Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity near $80$ K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p>

            <h2>Analytic solution for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large-amplitude oscillatory fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Ilg</p>
            <p>Nonlinear responses of physical systems to strong perturbations are notoriously difficult to tackle analytically. Here, we present analytic results for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large amplitude oscillatory magnetic fields based on a particular model for the magnetization dynamics. A number of characteristic features of the in-phase and out-of-phase higher-harmonic response are found and analyzed. In particular we find that the magnitude of higher harmonic contributions Rn depends on the field amplitude and frequency only via a single scaling variable that combines the two quantities. The decrease of |Rn|with increasing order nof harmonics is a key quantity monitored in biomedical applications such as magnetic particle spectroscopy and magnetic particle imaging. Except for the first few harmonics, we find that this decrease is exponential with a rate that depends on the scaling variable only. For not too high frequencies and not loo large amplitudes, we find that these exact results for one particular model of magnetization dynamics hold approximately also for other, more frequently used models. Our results therefore offer not only deeper insight into strongly nonlinear responses of magnetic nanoparticles, especially for higher harmonics that are very difficult to determine numerically, but also suggest analyzing data in terms of a scaling variable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Tsantilas, Trithep Devakul, Julian May-Mann</p>
            <p>We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of "double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moiré twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two identical copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly-correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly-correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly-correlated edge also has a gap to single-electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly-correlated edge.</p>

            <p>The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</p>

            <p>Introducing symmetry breaking in materials enables the emergence of functionalities. This can be microscopically and macroscopically driven by applying external stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field, temperature, and chemical modification. For instance, non-zero net dipole moments are formed in a material with the presence of local charged defects or their clusters, which can alter the crystal structure, charge states, and electrostatic potential across the material. Here, we demonstrate a conceptual approach to defects-mediated symmetry breaking that allows for built-in polarization in a centrosymmetric oxide, $\mathrm{Gd}_x\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{2-\delta}$ (CGO) films, via creating a macroscopic charge asymmetry. Our results show that switchable and enduring polarization in CGO films is governed by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies. This leads to notable and persistent pyroelectric effects with coefficient of approximately 180 $\mu\mathrm{C}\cdot\mathrm{m}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Our findings highlight the potential to develop high-performance, sustainable, environmentally friendly polar film materials by manipulating ionic defects from their centrosymmetric ground states. This approach provides new opportunities to expand polar materials in current and future energy and electronic applications.</p>

            <p>We have recently developed a breakthrough methodology for rapidly computing entropy in both solids and liquids by integrating a multiscale entropy approach (known as zentropy theory) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This approach enables entropy estimation from a single MD trajectory by analyzing the probabilities of local structural configurations and atomic distributions, effectively addressing the long-standing challenge of capturing configurational entropy. Here, we demonstrate the power of this method by predicting entropies, enthalpies, and melting points for 25 binary and ternary chlorite- and fluoride-based molten salts using ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations. The strong agreement between our predictions and experimental data underscores the potential of this approach to transform computational thermodynamics, offering accurate, efficient, and direct predictions of thermodynamic properties across both solid and liquid phases.</p>

            <h2>Delayed Active Swimmer in a Velocity Landscape</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viktor Holubec, Alexander Fischer, Giovanni Volpe, Frank Cichos</p>
            <p>Self-propelled active particles exhibit delayed responses to environmental changes, modulating their propulsion speed through intrinsic sensing and feedback mechanisms. This adaptive behavior fundamentally determines their dynamics and self-organization in active matter systems, with implications for biological microswimmers and engineered microrobots. Here, we investigate active Brownian particles whose propulsion speed is governed by spatially varying activity landscapes, incorporating a temporal delay between environmental sensing and speed adaptation. Through analytical solutions derived for both short-time and long-time delay regimes, we demonstrate that steady-state density and polarization profiles exhibit maxima at characteristic delays. Significantly, we observe that the polarization profile undergoes sign reversal when the swimming distance during the delay time exceeds the characteristic diffusion length, providing a novel mechanism for controlling particle transport without external fields. Our theoretical predictions, validated through experimental observations and numerical simulations, establish time delay as a crucial control parameter for particle transport and organization in active matter systems. These findings provide insights into how biological microorganisms might use response delays to gain navigation advantages and suggest design principles for synthetic microswimmers with programmable responses to heterogeneous environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Maghami, Merten Stender, Antonio Papangelo</p>
            <p>Understanding and predicting the adhesive properties of viscoelastic Hertzian contacts is crucial for diverse engineering applications, including robotics, biomechanics, and advanced material design. The maximum adherence force of a Hertzian indenter unloaded from a viscoelastic substrate has been studied with analytical and numerical models. Analytical models are valid within their assumptions, numerical methods offer precision but can be computationally expensive, necessitating alternative solutions. This study introduces a novel physics-augmented machine learning (PA-ML) framework as a hybrid approach, bridging the gap between analytical models and data-driven solutions, which is capable of rapidly predicting the pull-off force in an Hertzian profile unloaded from a broad band viscoelastic material, with varying Tabor parameter, preload and retraction rate. Compared to previous models, the PA-ML approach provides fast yet accurate predictions in a wide range of conditions, properly predicting the effective surface energy and the work-to-pull-off. The integration of the analytical model provides critical guidance to the PA-ML framework, supporting physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that physics augmentation enhances predictive accuracy, reducing mean squared error (MSE) while increasing model efficiency and interpretability. We provide data-driven and PA-ML models for real-time predictions of the adherence force in soft materials like silicons and elastomers opening to the possibility to integrate PA-ML into materials and interface design. The models are openly available on Zenodo and GitHub.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jhionathan de Lima, Cristiano F. Woellner</p>
            <p>Biphenylene nanotubes (BPNNTs) represent a novel class of carbon-based nanomaterials, constructed by rolling a biphenylene network (BPN) monolayer into a one-dimensional tubular structure. In this study, the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs are investigated using reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. At room temperature, the lattice thermal conductivity of armchair and zigzag BPNNTs is found to be approximately 100 W/m.K and 90 W/m.K, respectively. These values are at least one order of magnitude lower than those of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). This significant reduction is attributed to the unique atomic arrangement of BPNNTs, which promotes enhanced phonon scattering and significantly lower phonon group velocity. Furthermore, the effects of nanotube length, diameter, and temperature on thermal transport are systematically analyzed. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the geometry- and temperature-dependent thermal behavior, a comprehensive analysis of phonon dispersion relations, vibrational density of states, and phonon group velocities is conducted. This study offers valuable insight into the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs, with implications for thermal management and energy-related applications.</p>

            <p>The origin of electron-boson interactions is a key to understanding the mechanism of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates. While interactions with phonons and magnetic fluctuations are widely considered to mediate electron pairing in cuprates, the role of charge fluctuations, which is one of the fundamental degrees of freedom, remains unclear. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and angle-resolved inverse photoemission spectroscopy (AR-IPES) to investigate the electronic structure of the occupied and unoccupied states, respectively, in the electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. We found emergent spectral features in both the occupied (ARPES) and unoccupied states (AR-IPES), which are likely induced by charge fluctuations. The present study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the relationship between quantum charge fluctuations and superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Cholesterol is known to modulate the structure and function of biological membranes. In this study, we use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate phospholipid/cholesterol bilayer membranes modeled with two types of diblock copolymers. These copolymer-based bilayers serve as biomimetic platforms with applications in areas such as drug delivery. Our simulations identify a minimum free energy configuration characterized by phospholipid tails tilted relative to the membrane normal. The model quantitatively captures the well-known area condensation effect as cholesterol concentration increases, along with membrane thickening and reduced tilt angle. Thermodynamically, we observe a linear dependence between cholesterol's chemical potential and its concentration within the 37-50% range, consistent with experimental results. Additionally, we analyze the effects of block copolymer length and headgroup interactions on bilayer structure. Interactions between phospholipid headgroups and the solvent emerge as the most influential. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding cholesterol's regulatory role in membrane structure and mechanics.</p>

            <p>Trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ has been recently found to exhibit superconductivity in its high-pressure phase, similar to the previously discovered bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but with a notably lower transition temperature. To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</p>

We will focus on the process of four-wave mixing under the assumption of an undepleted pump. However, the approach taken is quite general, such that a different parametric process or the process under different assumptions is easily derived. First the classical theory of the coupled-mode equations as presented by O'Brien et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{113}:157001$] is shortly reviewed. Then a derivation of the full quantum theory is given using mesoscopic quantisation techniques in terms of discrete mode operators. This results in a Hamiltonian that describes the process of parametric amplification. We show that the coupled-mode equations can be derived from this Hamiltonian in the classical limit and elaborate on the validity of the theory.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</p>

            <p>By using the Krylov subspace technique to generate the spin coherent states in kicked top model, a prototype model for studying quantum chaos, the accessible system size for studying the Husimi functions of eigenstates can be much larger than that reported in the literature and our previous study Phys.

In the fully chaotic kicked top, we find that the mean Wehrl entropy localization measure approaches the prediction given by the Circular Unitary Ensemble. In the mixed-type case, we identify mixed eigenstates by the overlap of the Husimi function with regular and chaotic regions in classical compact phase space. Numerically, we show that the fraction of mixed eigenstates scales as $j^{-\zeta}$, a power-law decay as the system size $j$ increases, across nearly two orders of magnitude. This provides supporting evidence for the principle of uniform semiclassical condensation of Husimi functions and the Berry-Robnik picture in the semiclassical limit.</p>

            <p>Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) are generative models capable to learn data with a rich underlying structure. We study the teacher-student setting where a student RBM learns structured data generated by a teacher RBM. The amount of structure in the data is controlled by adjusting the number of hidden units of the teacher and the correlations in the rows of the weights, a.k.a. patterns. In the absence of correlations, we validate the conjecture that the performance is independent of the number of teacher patters and hidden units of the student RBMs, and we argue that the teacher-student setting can be used as a toy model for studying the lottery ticket hypothesis. Beyond this regime, we find that the critical amount of data required to learn the teacher patterns decreases with both their number and correlations. In both regimes, we find that, even with a relatively large dataset, it becomes impossible to learn the teacher patterns if the inference temperature used for regularization is kept too low. In our framework, the student can learn teacher patterns one-to-one or many-to-one, generalizing previous findings about the teacher-student setting with two hidden units to any arbitrary finite number of hidden units.</p>

            <p>We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</p>

            <p>We analyse the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.</p>

            <p>We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</p>

The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at subnanometer gap distances of the junction formed by an Ag tip and an Ag(111) surface, where a picocavity-enhanced field plays a crucial role. A significant redshift of the H-H stretch frequency is observed as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretch frequency is unaffected. Density functional theory, path-integral molecular dynamics, and quantum anharmonic vibrational energy calculations suggest that this unexpected isotope effect is explained by a different molecular density between H2 and D2 on the surface.</p>

            <h2>On symmetry-resolved generalized entropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Yan, Sara Murciano, Pasquale Calabrese, Robert Konik</p>
            <p>Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</p>

            <h2>Lattice random walks and quantum A-period conjecture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Gan</p>
            <p>We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua Yan</p>
            <p>The distribution of the consecutive level-spacing ratio is now widely used as a tool to distinguish integrable from chaotic quantum spectra, mostly due to its avoiding of the numerical spectral unfolding. Similar to the use of the Rosenzweig-Porter approach to obtain the Berry-Robnik distribution of level-spacings in mixed-type systems, in this work we extend this approach to derive analytically the distribution of spacing ratios, for random matrices comprised of independent integrable blocks and chaotic blocks. We have numerically confirmed this analytical result using random matrix theory in paradigmatic models such as the quantum kicked rotor and the Hénon-Heiles system.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of a voter model with an evolving number of opinion states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeehye Choi, Byungjoon Min, Tobias Galla</p>
            <p>In traditional voter models, opinion dynamics are driven by interactions between individuals, where an individual adopts the opinion of a randomly chosen neighbor. However, these models often fail to capture the emergence of entirely new opinions, which can arise spontaneously in real-world scenarios. Our study introduces a novel element to the classic voter model: the concept of innovation, where individuals have a certain probability of generating new opinions independently of their neighbors' states. This innovation process allows for a more realistic representation of social dynamics, where new opinions can emerge and old ones may fade over time. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we find that the balance between innovation and extinction shapes the number of opinions in the steady state. Specifically, for low innovation rates, the system tends toward near-consensus, while higher innovation rates lead to greater opinion diversity. We also show that network structure influences opinion dynamics, with greater degree heterogeneity reducing the number of opinions in the system.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Phase diagrams and transitions for Chern topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ralph M. Kaufmann, Mohamad Mousa, Birgit Wehefritz-Kaufmann</p>
            <p>Topological invariants such as Chern classes are by now a standard way to classify topological phases. Introducing and varying parameters in such systems leads to phase diagrams, where the Chern classes may jump when crossing a critical locus. These systems appear naturally when considering slicing of higher dimensional systems or when considering systems with parameters. As the Chern classes are topological invariants, they can only change if the "topology breaks down". We give a precise mathematical formulation of this phenomenon and show that synthetically any phase diagram of Chern topological phases can be designed and realized by a physical system, using covering, aka. winding maps. Here we provide explicit families realizing arbitrary Chern jumps. The critical locus of these maps is described by the classical rose curves. These realize the lower bound on the number of Dirac points necessary obtained from viewing them as local charges. We treat several concrete models and show that they have the predicted generic behavior. In particular, we focus on different types of lattices and tight-binding models, and show that effective winding maps, and thus higher Chern numbers, can be achieved using k-th nearest neighbors. We give explicit formulas for a family of 2D lattices using imaginary quadratic field extensions and their norms. Our study includes the square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices.</p>

            <h2>$N$-ality symmetry and SPT phases in (1+1)d</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Maeda, Tsubasa Oishi</p>
            <p>Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.</p>

            <h2>Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in a quantum fractal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Biplab Pal</p>
            <p>Fractal geometries exhibit complex structures with scale invariance self-similar pattern over various length scales. An artificially designed quantum fractal geometry embedded in a uniform magnetic flux has been explored in this study. It has been found that due to quantum mechanical effect, such quantum fractal display an exotic electronic property which is reflected in its transport characteristics. Owing to this uniform magnetic flux piercing through each closed-loop building block of the fractal structure, an electron traversing through such a fractal geometry will pick up a nontrivial Aharonov-Bohm phase factor, which will influence its transport through the system. It is shown that, one can completely block the transmission of an electron in this fractal geometry by setting the value of the uniform magnetic flux to half flux quantum. This phenomenon of Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in this quantum fractal geometry has been supported by the computation of the energy spectrum, two-terminal transport and persistent current in its various generations. This result is very robust against disorder and could be useful in designing efficient quantum algorithms using a quantum fractal network.</p>

            <h2>The role of confined water in the emergence of electrostatic strong coupling as revealed by nanoseparated charged lipid layers</h2>

            <p>This study investigates the interplay between Strong Coupling (SC) attraction and hydration repulsion in nanoconfined water between like-charged phospholipid layers. It challenges the assumption that SC attraction requires multivalent counterions by showing that hydration water can enhance electrostatic interactions. We combine reflectivities with numerical simulations to analyze supported phospholipid layers under different relative humidity and surface charge densities. X-ray fluorescence demonstrates that we can control the valence of the associated counterions. Experimental measurement of the water thickness, combined with precise determination of charged surface positions by numerical simulations, enable us to compare our experiments with a theoretical model. It shows that charge-screening by hydration water induces SC attraction, even at moderate surface charge densities with monovalent counterions. Furthermore, hydration repulsion is stronger for DPPS compared to DPPC. These findings offer insights into the forces that control interactions between phospholipid layers and have important implications for biological and colloidal systems.</p>

            <p>The activation free energy of electron transfer (ET) reactions is governed by a crucial parameter: the reorganization energy. In heterogeneous ET at electrified solid-liquid interfaces, it is presumed that only factors in the electrolyte phase are responsible for determining the reorganization energy. Here, we demonstrate the contribution of the electronic density of states (DOS) of the electrode to the reorganization energy. Using van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional crystals, we tune the DOS of graphene and measure its impact on outer-sphere ET. We find the ensuing variation in ET rate arises from modulation in a reorganization energy associated with image potential localization in the electrode, which is dependent on the DOS. This work establishes a fundamental role of the electrode electronic structure in interfacial charge transfer.</p>

We explore the energy landscape, quantized levels, and switching dynamics relevant for qubit state manipulation. Additionally, we present models for phase, flux, and charge qubit designs, emphasizing their operational principles and readout mechanisms.

            <p>Photon magnon hybrid systems present a promising platform for the development of next generation devices in quantum information processing and quantum sensing technologies. In this study, we investigate the control of photon magnon coupling (PMC) strength through systematic variation of the saturation magnetization in a planar hexagonal ring resonator (HRR) integrated with a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film configuration. Using full wave numerical simulations in CST Microwave Studio, we demonstrate that tuning the Ms of the YIG film from 1750 Oe to 900 Oe enables systematic control over the coupling strength across the 127 to 51 MHz range at room temperature. To explain the observed PMC dynamics, we develop a semiclassical analytical model based on electromagnetic theory that accurately reproduces the observed coupling behavior, revealing the key role of spin density in mediating the light matter interaction. The model is further extended to include the effects of variable magnon damping across different Ms values, enabling broader frequency control. These findings establish Ms as a key tuning parameter for tailoring PMC, with direct implications for the design of tunable hybrid systems for reconfigurable quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride, successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase P21m BiH2 exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 70 K among MH2type hydrides apart from H2S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for P21m and C2m BiH2 indicate that the upper critical fields miu0Hc2(0) is 12 to 16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar Tc. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH2, about 1.1 106 m s, which allows to classify BiH2 as a soft molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum Jc(0) is 10 kA mm2), which indicates the presence of two s wave superconducting gaps in BiH2 at 172 to 176 GPa: deltaL(0) is 6.9 1.2 meV and deltaS(0) is 1.5 meV.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have demonstrated ambient pressure superconductivity in compressively strained La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films, yet the phase diagram of heterovalent doping$-$critical for advancing the field$-$remains unexplored. Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</p>

Here we develop a spin-dependent scattering matrix approach to describe spin and charge transport in a multiterminal system in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our framework generalizes the Büttiker formalism by offering explicit real-space expressions for spin and charge current densities, along with the corresponding linear response function. It simultaneously captures the effects of quantum confinement, the orbital response to external magnetic fields, and the intrinsic (geometric) properties of the electronic bands, offering a comprehensive description of the spin-charge interconversion mechanisms at play in a Hall bar, in agreement with experiments.</p>

            <p>The discovery of high-density liquid (HDL) and low-density liquid (LDL) water has been a major success of molecular simulations, yet extending this analysis to interfacial water is challenging due to conventional order parameters assuming local homogeneity. This limitation previously prevented resolving the composition of the surface layer of the liquid/vapour interface. Here, we apply a recently introduced topological order parameter [R. Foffi and F. Sciortino, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 378-386 (2022)] to analyze the composition of the water/vapor interface across a broad temperature range. Our results reveal that LDL-like water dominates the outermost region at all temperatures, while HDL-like water accumulates beneath it, presenting a clear layering roughly below the temperature of maximum density. This structured stratification, previously inaccessible, highlights the power of the topological order parameter in resolving interfacial molecular heterogeneity and provides new insights into the structural properties of water at interfaces.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism, a newly discovered magnetic order, combines zero net magnetization with non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic bands. Its ability to utilize the advantages of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets is highly promising for spintronic applications. Currently, the merge of altermagnetism and weak ferromagnetism in a single material excites significant interest as it provides additional control mechanisms over material properties. However, the role of dimensionality in this interplay is yet to be explored. Here, we study magnetism and electron transport in epitaxial films of the candidate altermagnet GdAlGe ranging from bulklike to a single monolayer. The films exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and negative magnetoresistance. In contrast to altermagnetic GdAlSi, the candidate altermagnet GdAlGe demonstrates an admixture of the ferromagnetic state which contribution increases as the system approaches the 2D limit. The coexistence of the magnetic states induces technologically important intrinsic exchange bias. The present work underpins future studies and applications of nanoscale altermagnets.</p>

            <p>We study a strongly anisotropic self-organized critical system coupled to an isotropic random fluid environment. The former is described by a continuous (coarse-grained) model due to Hwa and Kardar. The latter is modeled by the Navier--Stokes equation with a random stirring force of a rather general form that includes, in particular, the overall shaking of the system and a non-local part with power-law spectrum $\sim k^{4-d-y}$ that describes, in the limiting case $y \to 4$, a turbulent fluid. The full problem of the two coupled stochastic equations is represented as a field theoretic model which is shown to be multiplicatively renormalizable and logarithmic at $d=4$. Due to the interplay between isotropic and anisotropic interactions, the corresponding renormalization group (RG) equations reveal a rich pattern of possible infrared (large scales, long times) regimes of asymptotic behaviour of various Green's functions. The attractors of the RG equations in the five-dimensional space of coupling parameters include a two-dimensional surface of Gaussian (free) fixed points, a single fixed point that corresponds to the plain advection by the turbulent fluid (the Hwa--Kardar self-interaction is irrelevant) and a one-dimensional curve of fixed points that corresponds to the case where the Hwa--Kardar nonlinearity and the uniform stirring are simultaneously relevant. The character of attractiveness is determined by the exponent $y$ and the dimension of space $d$; the most interesting case $d=3$ and $y \to 4$ is described by the single fixed point. The corresponding critical dimensions of the frequency and the basic fields are found exactly.</p>

            <p>Exceptional point (EP) and topological phase transition (TPT) in non-Hermitian systems have recently garnered significant attention owing to their fundamental importance and potential applications in sensing and topological devices. Beyond the EP induced by non-reciprocal hopping, we show that random disorder can also drive the valence and conduction bands across EPs, even twice in the non-Hermitian regime. Remarkably, a TPT can occur concurrently with an EP as disorder strength increases. These disorder-driven EPs and concurrent TPTs are well captured by effective medium theory. The analysis reveals that their emergence results from the interplay between disorder-induced energy level renormalization and non-reciprocal hopping-induced inter-level coupling, which fundamentally restructures the spectral properties of the system. The phase diagram in the parameter space of non-reciprocal hopping and disorder strength identifies robust EP lines. Interestingly, two EP lines can emerge from the TPT point in the Hermitian limit. As non-reciprocal hopping increases, these lines split, with one aligning the TPT, leading to distinct disorder-induced EPs. Our results uncover a robust, disorder-driven mechanism for generating EPs and concurrent TPTs, offering a new direction for exploring non-Hermitian topological matter.</p>

The real-space geometry can be used to tune into topological phases occupying an expanded phase space compared to crystals, or into a disorder-driven topological Anderson insulator. The quantum metric can also be tuned continuously, opening new routes towards tunable single- and many-body physics in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.</p>

            <p>Diffusion in heterogeneous energy and diffusivity landscapes is widespread in biological systems. However, solving the Langevin equation in such environments introduces ambiguity due to the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, which depends on the underlying physics and can take values in the range $0<\alpha<1$. The typical interpretations are Itô ($\alpha=0$), Stratonovich ($\alpha=1/2$), and Hänggi-Klimontovich ($\alpha=1$). Here, we analyse the motion of a particle in an harmonic potential -- modelled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process -- with diffusivity that varies in space. Our focus is on two-phase systems with a discontinuity in environmental properties at $x=0$. We derive the probability density of the particle position for the process, and consider two paradigmatic situations. In the first one, the damping coefficient remains constant, and fluctuation-dissipation relations are not satisfied. In the second one, these relations are enforced, leading to a position-dependent damping coefficient. In both cases, we provide solutions as a function of the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, with particular attention to the Itô, Stratonovich, and Hänggi-Klimontovich interpretations, revealing fundamentally different behaviours, in particular with respect to an interface located at the potential minimum.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Haag, Marius Weber, Kai Leckron, Libor Šmejkal, Jairo Sinova, Hans Christian Schneider</p>
            <p>In planar altermagnets, optical excitation by linearly polarized ultrashort pulses can induce spin polarizations in the electronic excited states in a controlled fashion, even though the material is magnetically compensated. Here, we theoretically analyze the response of the prototypical bulk g-wave altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe to polarized ultrashort pulses. By calculating the excited electron distributions based on ab-initio band structure data, we show how this excited electronic spin response in $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits different symmetries which are determined by the nodal planes intrinsic to the bulk g-wave altermagnet. We present a simple procedure to obtain the symmetry of the electronic spin response from the two-dimensional cuts through the three-dimensional band structure.</p>

            <h2>Variational quantum simulation of a nonadditive relaxation dynamics in a qubit coupled to a finite-temperature bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Q. Galvão, Clebson Cruz, Antonio Cesar do Prado Rosa Junior, Marcelo A. Moret</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present an application of the variational quantum simulation (VQS) framework to capture finite-temperature open-system dynamics on near-term quantum hardware. By embedding the generalized amplitude-damping channel into the VQS algorithm, we modeled the energy exchange with a thermal bath through its Lindblad representation and thereby simulated realistic dissipative effects. To explore a wide range of activation behaviors, we introduce a nonadditive relaxation-time model using a generalized form of the Arrhenius law, based on the phenomenological parameter q. We compare our method on a driven qubit subject to both static and composite time-dependent fields, comparing population evolution and trace distance errors against exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that (i) VQS accurately maps the effective nonunitary generator under generalized amplitude damping, (ii) smoother drive envelopes induced by nonaddtive parameters suppress high frequency components and yield lower simulation errors, and (iii) the variational manifold exhibits dynamical selectivity, maintaining mapping fidelity even as the exact solution's sensitivity to q increases.

These superconducting devices underpin essential developments across quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communication and open pathways to innovative applications in nonreciprocal electronics. These developments are enabled by recent breakthroughs in nanofabrication and characterization methodologies, substantially enhancing device performance and scalability. The resulting innovations reshape our understanding of quantum systems and enable practical applications. This perspective explores the foundational role of Josephson junctions research in propelling quantum technologies forward. We underscore the critical importance of synergistic progress in material science, device characterization, and nanofabrication to catalyze the next wave of breakthroughs and accelerate the transition from fundamental discoveries to industrial-scale quantum utilities. Drawing parallels with the transformative impact of transistor-based integrated circuits during the Information Age, we envision Josephson junction-based circuits as central to driving a similar revolution in the emerging Quantum Age.</p>

            <h2>Implicit bias produces neural scaling laws in learning curves, from perceptrons to deep networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco D'Amico, Dario Bocchi, Matteo Negri</p>
            <p>Scaling laws in deep learning - empirical power-law relationships linking model performance to resource growth - have emerged as simple yet striking regularities across architectures, datasets, and tasks. These laws are particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training or on the optimal training time given the model size. In this work, we uncover a richer picture by analyzing the entire training dynamics through the lens of spectral complexity norms. We identify two novel dynamical scaling laws that govern how performance evolves during training. These laws together recover the well-known test error scaling at convergence, offering a mechanistic explanation of generalization emergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide analytical support using a solvable model: a single-layer perceptron trained with binary cross-entropy. In this setting, we show that the growth of spectral complexity driven by the implicit bias mirrors the generalization behavior observed at fixed norm, allowing us to connect the performance dynamics to classical learning rules in the perceptron.</p>

            <p>In this work, using two distinct semiclassical approaches, namely the mean-field Ehrenfest (MFE) method and the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH), we investigate the spectral function of a single charge interacting with phonons on a lattice. This quantity is relevant for the description of angle-resolved photoemission experiments. Focusing on the one-dimensional Holstein model, we compare the performance of these approaches across a range of coupling strengths and lattice sizes, exposing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. We demonstrate that these approaches can be efficiently applied with reasonable accuracy to ab initio polaron models. Our work provides a route to the calculation of spectral properties in realistic electron-phonon-coupled systems in a computationally inexpensive manner with encouraging accuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Xin Wu, Jin-Fu Chen, H. T. Quan</p>
            <p>Hysteresis and metastable states are typical features associated with ergodicity breaking in the first-order phase transition. We explore the scaling relations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in finite-time first-order phase transitions. Using the Curie-Weiss model as an example, for large systems we find the excess work scales as $v^{2/3}$ when the magnetic field is quenched at a finite rate $v$ across the phase transition. We further reveal a crossover in the scaling of the excess work from $v^{2/3}$ to $v$ when downsizing the system. Our study elucidates the interplay between the finite-time dynamics and the finite-size effect, which leads to different scaling behaviors of the excess work with or without ergodicity breaking.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vito Marino, Alberto Scazzola, Federico Becca, Massimo Capone, Luca F. Tocchio</p>
            <p>We study a three-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model relevant for iron-based superconductors using variational wave functions explicitly including spatial correlations and electron pairing. We span the nonmagnetic sector from filling $n=4$, which is representative of undoped iron-based superconductors, to $n=3$, where a Mott insulating state with each orbital at half filling is found. In the strong-coupling regime, when the electron density is increased, we find a spontaneous differentiation between the occupation of $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, leading to an orbital-selective state with a nematic character that becomes stronger at increasing density. One of these orbitals stays half-filled for all densities while the other one hosts (together with the $d_{xy}$ orbital) the excess of electron density. Most importantly, in this regime long-range pairing correlations appear in the orbital with the largest occupation. Our results highlight a strong link between orbital-selective correlations, nematicity, and superconductivity, which requires the presence of a significant Hund's coupling.</p>

            <p>Understanding the chemical state of individual ions in solutions is crucial for advancing knowledge of complex chemical systems. However, analyzing systems at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a significant challenge. We present a strategy that leverages the optical emission properties of point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as sensitive ion detectors. The interaction of optically active h-BN defects with ions in solution leads to distinct spectral shifts, enabling precise visualization and analyzing of individual ions. Using Li+ ions in organic electrolytes as a model, we observed spectral shifts exceeding 10 nm upon ion addition. Application of an external electric field further enhanced these shifts to over 40 nm, enabling real-time monitoring of electrical field induced local perturbations of Li+ ions. Following this approach, we showed that each individual single point defect can be used to spectroscopically distinguish ions of varying charges (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+) based on their local electric fields, each producing a distinct spectral shift. This platform allows direct visualization of ions and their chemical states in liquid environments, providing insights into subtle interfacial changes at the single-ion level, with measurable spectral shifts detectable at millisecond temporal resolution and at concentrations down to the millimolar range. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids that include battery technology and environmental science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun-Jiang Luo, Jia-Zheng Li, Meng Xiao, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>The abundance of bulk and boundary topologies in higher-order topological phases offer remarkable tunability and diversity to boundary states but also pose a challenge to their unified topological characterization. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to characterize time-reversal invariant topological superconductors hosting Majorana Kramers pairs (MKP) of corner states by using a series of spin Bott indices, which capture both bulk and boundary states topology. The developed invariants can characterize MKP in arbitrarily shaped systems and all distinct spatial distribution patterns of MKP. As an illustrative example, we apply our theory to analyze the Kane-Mele model with sublattice-dependent superconducting pairing potentials. In this representative model, both intrinsic and extrinsic higher-order topological superconductors can be realized and various patterns of MKP can be engineered through edge cleavage. Despite their high sensitivity to boundary terminations, MKP can be faithfully characterized by the proposed topological this http URL further demonstrate the characterization of higher-order topological superconductors in the BDI symmetry class using Bott indices without resolving the spin degree of freedom.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladislav Popkov, Xin Zhang, Carlo Presilla, Tomaz Prosen</p>
            <p>We find that the density operator of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of XXZ spin chain with strong ``sink and source" boundary dissipation, can be described in terms of quasiparticles, with renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. The spectrum of the NESS is then fully accounted for by Bethe ansatz equations for an associated coherent system. The dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, which strongly modifies the NESS spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model. In particular, this leads to a dissipation-assisted entropy reduction, due to the suppression -- in the NESS spectrum -- of plain wave-type Bethe states in favor of Bethe states localized at the boundaries.</p>

            <p>We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of \textit{Fermi surface nesting}, we show that superconductivity can emerge near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the $p+ip$, $h+ih$, and the nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in {a narrow stripe shape of superconducting region}, consistent with experimental findings. We point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation with a dominant $p+ip$ pairing. The possibility of realizing intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in other rhombohedral graphene systems is also discussed.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic resetting prevails over sharp restart for broad target distributions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin R. Evans, Somrita Ray</p>
            <p>Resetting has been shown to reduce the completion time for a stochastic process, such as the first passage time for a diffusive searcher to find a target. The time between two consecutive resetting events is drawn from a waiting time distribution $\psi(t)$, which defines the resetting protocol. Previously, it has been shown that deterministic resetting process with a constant time period, referred to as sharp restart, can minimize the mean first passage time to a fixed target. Here we consider the more realistic problem of a target positioned at a random distance $R$ from the resetting site, selected from a given target distribution $P_T(R)$. We introduce the notion of a conjugate target distribution to a given waiting time distribution. The conjugate target distribution, $P_T^*(R)$, is that $P_T(R)$ for which $\psi(t)$ extremizes the mean time to locate the target. In the case of diffusion we derive an explicit expression for $P^*_T(R)$ conjugate to a given $\psi(t)$ which holds in arbitrary spatial dimension. Our results show that stochastic resetting prevails over sharp restart for target distributions with exponential or heavier tails.</p>

            <p>We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same distance from jamming density, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</p>

            <p>The fate of the Fermi surface in bulk electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ remains elusive, as does the origin and extension of its pseudogap phase. Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. We find that the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, and thus beyond the sharp increase in Hall carrier density to $\simeq 1+x$ recently observed above $x^{*}=0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1593 (2024)]. This suggests that doped iridates host a unique phase of matter in which a large Hall density coexists with an anisotropic pseudogap, breaking up the Fermi surface into disconnected arcs. The temperature boundary of the pseudogap is $T^{*}\simeq 200$ K for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates and to the energy scale of short range antiferromagnetic correlations in cuprates and iridates.</p>

Upon suddenly increasing the effective atomic mass, the BEC as a whole behaves as a classical rigid body with its center-of-mass receiving random momentum kicks by a Langevin force arising from atom loss and interactions with the surrounding thermal cloud. Physically, this amounts to selective heating of the BEC center-of-mass degree of freedom by a sudden quench, while with regard to the relative coordinates, the BEC is stablized by repulsive atomic interactions, and its internal dynamics is suppressed by forced evaporative cooling induced by atom loss. A phenomenological theory is developed that well explains the experimental data quantitatively.</p>

            <h2>Heat Transport in Ionic Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cillian Cockrell, Aleksandra Dragović</p>
            <p>Heat transfer in liquids is a very challenging problem as it combines the competing effect of high frequency oscillations, which dominate liquid heat capacity, and diffusive motion, which enables transport macroscopic flow. This issue is compounded by the relatively junior state of dynamical theories of liquid thermodynamics. Nevertheless, molten salts are playing an increasingly important role in industrial and energy applications and there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms behind their irreversible transport processes. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the heat transport of three different molten salts: LiCl, KCl, and the eutectic point of their mixture. While all simulations consider the properties of the liquid within the frame of its centre of mass, we calculate different susceptibilities which implicitly include and explicitly exclude the heat carried by partial mass currents within this frame. We find that, while the heat advected by partial mass currents in the mixture increases with increasing temperature, the heat transferred by collective vibrational motion (phonons) decreases with increasing temperature. This causes a maximum in the heat conductance with temperature in the mixtures only - in pure salts each contribution decreases monotonically with temperature. We attribute this anomaly to the extra freedom afforded to ionic motion in mixtures - in pure salts the motion of cations and anions is bound due to conservation of linear momentum. In mixtures, a coherent but diffusive collective motion is enabled by the release of Li ions from this condition by the introduction of a third species. We tentatively ascribe this coherent collective motion to the ``diffusive" phonons that have been used to explain a similar anomaly in the thermal conductivity of solids.</p>

            <p>Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave gap is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeema field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</p>

            <p>Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a single-celled parasite and natural microswimmer, is responsible for fatal sleeping sickness in infected mammals, including humans. Understanding how T. brucei interacts with fluid environments and navigates through confining spaces is crucial not only for medical and clinical applications but also for a fundamental understanding of how life organizes in a confined microscopic world. Using a hybrid multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD)--molecular dynamics (MD) approach, we present our investigations on the locomotion of an in silico T. brucei in three types of fluid environments: bulk fluid, straight cylindrical microchannels, and microchannels with constrictions. We observe that the helical swimming trajectory of the in silico T. brucei becomes rectified in straight cylindrical channels compared to bulk fluid. The swimming speed for different channel widths is governed by the diameter of the helical trajectory. The speed first slightly increases as the channel narrows and then decreases when the helix diameter is compressed. An optimal swimming speed is achieved, when the channel width is approximately twice the bulk helix diameter. It results from an interplay of the trypanosome's hydrodynamic interactions with the cylindrical channel walls and the high deformability of the parasite. In microchannels with constrictions, the motions of the anterior and posterior ends, the end-to-end distance, and the log-rolling motion of the cell body are characterized and show salient differences compared to the straight-channel case. Depending on the constriction length and width, we observe characteristic slip, stuck, and stuck-slip motions of the model T. brucei within the constriction. Our findings may provide some mechanical insights into how T. brucei moves through blood vessels and tissues, and across the blood-brain barrier.</p>

This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.</p>

            <p>Ferroelectric polarization switching in electrically controlled van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) causes atomic migration, compromising device stability and fatigue resistance. Here we propose a fully magnetically controlled vdW-MFTJ based on a \(\mathrm{CrBr_3/MnPSe_3/CrBr_3}\) vertical heterostructure, which achieves ferroelectric polarization reversal without relying on atomic migration driven by inversion symmetry breaking. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Simulations of Three-dimensional Nematic Guidance of Microswimmers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyang Mou, Yuan Li, Zhihong You, Rui Zhang</p>
            <p>It has been shown that an anisotropic liquid crystalline (LC) environment can be used to guide the self-propulsion dynamics of dispersed microswimmers, such as bacteria. This type of composite system is named "living nematic" (LN). In the dilute limit, bacteria are found to mainly follow the local director field. Beyond the dilute limit, however, they exhibit novel dynamical behaviors, from swirling around a spiral +1 defect pattern to forming undulating waves, and to active turbulence. Our current knowledge of how these different behaviors emerge at different population densities remains limited. Here we develop a hybrid method to simulate the dynamics of microswimmers dispersed in a nematic LC. Specifically, we model the microswimmers using active Brownian dynamics method, which is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of nematic LCs to describe the evolution of the flow field and the LC structure. Our method is validated by comparing to existing quasi-two-dimensional (2D) experiments, including undulated swirling around a spiral pattern and stabilized undulated jets on a periodic C-pattern. We further extend our method to three-dimensional (3D) systems by examining loop-defect dynamics. We find that the morphodynamics and destiny of a loop defect not only depend on the activity (self-propulsion velocity), effective size, and the initial distribution of the swimmers, but also rely on its winding profile. Specifically, +1/2 wedge and radial twist winding can dictate the dynamics of loop defects. By varying the characteristic reversal time, we predict that microswimmers not necessarily accumulate in splay regions. Taken together, our hybrid method provides a faithful tool to explain and guide the experiments of LNs in both 2D and 3D, sheds light on the interplay between microswimmer distribution and defect dynamics, and unravels the design principles of using LCs to control active matter.</p>

            <h2>Orientation-dependent transport in junctions formed by $d$-wave altermagnets and $d$-wave superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjun Zhao, Yuri Fukaya, Pablo Burset, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu</p>
            <p>We investigate de Gennes-Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. Even though these states are associated to long junctions, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet in a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction forms de Gennes-Saint-James states in a short junction due to an enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors. As a result, the zero-bias conductance peak vanishes and pronounced resonance spikes emerge in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the $d_{xy}$-altermagnet only features de Gennes-Saint-James states in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I(\varphi)$ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi$ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.</p>

            <h2>Dimer problem on a spherical surface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Tononi, D. S. Petrov, M. Lewenstein</p>
            <p>We solve the problem of a dimer moving on a spherical surface and find that its binding energy and wave function are sensitive to the total angular momentum. The dimer gets squeezed in the direction orthogonal to the center-of-mass motion and can qualitatively change its geometry from two-dimensional to one-dimensional. These results suggest that combining the curved geometry with finite angular momentum may give rise to qualitatively new many-body phenomena in ultracold shell-shaped gases.</p>

            <h2>High-pressure floating zone crystal growth of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. J. Gomez Alvarado, Y. Pang, P. A. Barrera, D. Rout, C. Robison, Z. Porter, H. Z. Porter, E. A. Lawrence, E. N. Bassey, S. D. Wilson</p>
            <p>Here we demonstrate the floating zone crystal growth of the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Historically, the growth of iridates from a ternary melt has been precluded by the extreme vapor pressure of the metal oxide species and the difficulty of maintaining the correct oxidation state of Ir at high temperatures. Here, we show that the application of a high-pressure oxygen growth environment stabilizes the Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ phase, leading to the first demonstration of cm$^{3}$-scale crystals. In contrast to the conventional SrCl$_2$ flux growth method, where poor control over disorder leads to strong sample dependence, the high-pressure floating zone growth enables active control over the homogeneity of the melt. Crystals grown via this technique possess qualitatively similar properties to those grown via flux, with a relatively sharp onset of antiferromagnetic order observed in temperature-dependent magnetization. Further, we demonstrate that by tuning the mixing rate of the melt, we are able to grow natively hole-doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-y}$O$_4$, which exhibits a strongly modified magnetic and electronic response.</p>

            <h2>Ancilla theory of twisted bilayer graphene I: topological Mott localization and pseudogap metal in twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Yu Zhao, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>The recent experimental studies of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) raise a fundamental question: how do we understand Mott localization in a topological band? In this work, we offer a new perspective of Mott physics, which can be generalized to TBG directly in momentum space. In our theory, the Mott gap is understood as from an exciton-like hybridization $\Phi(\mathbf k) c^\dagger(\mathbf k)\psi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical electron $c$ and an ancilla fermion $\psi$. In the conventional Mott insulator of trivial band, the hybridization is $s$-wave with $\Phi(\mathbf k)=\frac{U}{2}$, where $U$ is the on-site Hubbard interaction. On the other hand, the band topology in TBG enforces a topological Mott hybridization with $\Phi(\mathbf k)\sim k_x \pm i k_y$ in a small region around $\mathbf{k}=0$. We dub this new Mott state as topological Mott localization because of the $p\pm ip$ order parameter analogous to the topological superconductor. At $\nu=0$, we find a topological Mott semimetal with a low energy effective theory resembling that of the untwisted bilayer graphene. For $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we show transitions from correlated insulators to Mott semimetals at smaller $U$. In the most intriguing density region $\nu=-2-x$, we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Interestingly, the quasiparticle is primarily formed by ancilla fermion, which we interpret as a composite fermion formed by a hole bound to a particle-hole pair. Our theory offers a unified language to describe the Mott localization in both trivial and topological bands in momentum space, and we anticipate applications in other moiré systems with topological Wannier obstruction, such as the twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayer.</p>

            <h2>Magnon damping and mode softening in quantum double-exchange ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Moreo, E. Dagotto, G. Alvarez, T. Tohyama, M. Mierzejewski, J. Herbrych</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic excitations and electronic properties of fully quantum double-exchange ferromagnets, i.e., systems where ferromagnetic ordering emerges from the competition between spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom, but without the canonical approximation of using classical localized spins. Specifically, we investigate spin excitations within the Kondo lattice-like model, as well as a two-orbital Hubbard Hamiltonian in proximity to the orbital-selective Mott phase. Computational analysis of the magnon dispersion, damping, and spectral weight within these models reveals unexpected phenomena, such as magnon mode softening and the anomalous decoherence of magnetic excitations as observed in earlier experimental efforts, but explained here without the use of the phononic degrees of freedom. We show that these effects are intrinsically linked to incoherent spectral features near the Fermi level, which arise due to the quantum nature of the local (on-site) triplets. This incoherent spectrum leads to a Stoner-like continuum on which spin excitations scatter, governing magnon lifetime and strongly influencing the dynamical spin structure factor. Our study explores the transition from coherent to incoherent magnon spectra by varying the electron density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the localized spin mitigates decoherence by suppressing the incoherent spectral contributions near the Fermi level. We also discuss the effective $J_1$-$J_2$ spin Hamiltonian, which can accurately describe the large doping region characterized by the magnon-mode softening. Finally, we show that this behavior is also present in multiorbital models with partially filled orbitals, namely, in systems without localized spin moments, provided that the model is in a strong coupling regime.</p>

            <h2>Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor artificial graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gökhan Öztarhan, Paweł Potasz, A. D. Güçlü</p>
            <p>We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the generalized Hubbard model. We analyze models of armchair hexagonal geometries nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling. This form of itinerant magnetism predicted rigorously for Hubbard model remained unascertained in large scale realistic systems. We demonstrate that Coulomb scattering terms play a crucial role in stabilizing Nagaoka ferromagnetism, enabling the observation of the phase transition for system parameters near $U/t \approx 60$.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Instabilities with Quantum Geometry in Flat Band Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Xin Zhang, Wen O. Wang, Leon Balents, Lucile Savary</p>
            <p>The absence of a well-defined Fermi surface in flat-band systems challenges the conventional understanding of instabilities toward Landau order based on nesting. We investigate the existence of an intrinsic nesting structure encoded in the band geometry (i.e. the wavefunctions of the flat band(s)), which leads to a maximal susceptibility at the mean-field level and thus determines the instability towards ordered phases. More generally, we show that for a given band structure and observable, we can define two vector fields: one which corresponds to the Bloch vector of the projection operator onto the manifold of flat bands, and another which is "dressed" by the observable. The overlap between the two vector fields, possibly shifted by a momentum vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$, fully determines the mean field susceptibility of the corresponding order parameter. When the overlap is maximized, so is the susceptibility, and this geometrically corresponds to "perfect nesting" of the band structure. In that case, we show that the correlation length of this order parameter, even for $\boldsymbol{Q}\neq \boldsymbol{0}$, is entirely characterized by a generalized quantum metric in an intuitive manner, and is therefore lower-bounded in topologically non-trivial bands. As an example, we demonstrate hidden nesting for staggered antiferromagnetic spin order in an exactly flat-band model, which is notably different from the general intuition that flat bands are closely associated with ferromagnetism. We check the actual emergence of this long-range order using the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like state (pairing with non-zero center of mass momentum) can arise in flat bands upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, even if Zeeman splitting is absent.</p>
