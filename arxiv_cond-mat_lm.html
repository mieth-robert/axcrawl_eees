            <h2>Atomic-Scale Quantum Control of Single Spin Defects in a Two-Dimensional Semiconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kwan Ho Au-Yeung, Wantong Huang, Johanna Matusche, Paul Greule, Jonas Arnold, Lovis Hardeweg, Máté Stark, Luise Renz, Affan Safeer, Daniel Jansen, Thomas Michely, Jeison Fischer, Wolfgang Wernsdorfer, Christoph Sürgers, Hannu-Pekka Komsa, Johannes Schwenk, Wouter Jolie, Philip Willke</p>
            <p>Individual spin defects in solids are promising building blocks for quantum technologies, but their deterministic creation, individual addressability, and operation near surfaces remain major challenges. Two-dimensional materials provide an attractive alternative, as their single-layer thickness enables direct atomic-scale access to defect states. Here, we demonstrate single-spin control of solid-state defects in a two-dimensional semiconductor by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. We create and manipulate individual sulfur vacancies and carbon substitution defects in monolayer molybdenum disulfide and characterize their spin dynamics, including coherent control, at the single-defect level. Using atomic manipulation, we further engineer and probe spin-spin interactions between defect pairs. Our results demonstrate deterministic creation, addressability, coherent manipulation, and controlled coupling of individual spin defects within a single experimental platform. This establishes atomically engineered spin defects in two-dimensional semiconductors as a versatile class of controllable solid-state quantum systems and opens a route towards tailored quantum sensing experiments.</p>

            <h2>Resonant Zener Interferometry in van der Waals Heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nisarga Paul, Gil Refael</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the presence of quantum interference effects in van der Waals heterostructures subject to in-plane electric fields. The in-plane field $F$ accelerates carriers through a hybridized band edge, and interlayer Zener tunneling occurs by distinct pathways, resulting in a solid-state quantum interferometer with imprints in transport observables. For parabolic-band bilayers, we identify two characteristic signatures which are observable in lateral conductance: Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg oscillations in the band-overlap regime periodic in $1/F$ at small fields, resembling electric-field induced quantum oscillations, and a pronounced resonance at $F\propto T_0^{3/2}$ set by the interlayer tunneling $T_0$. These features provide a directly accessible probe of coherent interferometric dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures, and could be harnessed for more precise engineering and characterization.</p>

            <h2>Controlled symmetry breaking of the Fermi surface in ultracold polar molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shrestha Biswas, Sebastian Eppelt, Weikun Tian, Wei Zhang, Fulin Deng, Christine Frank, Tao Shi, Immanuel Bloch, Xin-Yu Luo</p>
            <p>Long-range anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions between ultracold polar molecules are predicted to drive exotic quantum phases, yet direct many-body signatures of these interactions in degenerate Fermi gases have remained elusive. Here, we report the observation of an interaction-induced controlled deformation of the Fermi surface, providing a clear many-body signature in a deeply degenerate Fermi gas of $^{23}\text{Na}^{40}\text{K}$ molecules. Using double microwave (MW) shielding, we prepare $8 \times 10^3$ molecules at $0.23(1)$ times the Fermi temperature, achieving a three-fold suppression of inelastic losses compared to single MW shielding while preserving strong elastic dipolar scattering. We observe Fermi surface deformations of up to $7\,\%$, more than two times larger than those observed in magnetic atoms, despite operating at two orders of magnitude lower densities. Crucially, we demonstrate continuous tuning of the interaction potential from axial U(1) to biaxial C$_{2}$ symmetry, directly imprinting this geometry onto the Fermi surface. We find excellent agreement between our experimental results and parameter-free Hartree-Fock theory. These results establish MW-shielded polar molecules as a highly tunable platform for exploring strongly correlated dipolar Fermi matter and offer a promising path towards topological superfluidity.</p>

            <h2>Many-Body effects beyond excitons in second-harmonic generation of monolayer MoS$_{2}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peio Garcia-Goiricelaya, Julen Ibañez-Azpiroz</p>
            <p>We present a quantitative study of many-body effects including the three-particle level on second-harmonic generation in monolayer MoS$_{2}$. Our approach combines many-body perturbation theory with time-dependent current-density-functional theory within an \textit{ab initio} framework in the optical limit. Inclusion of two-particle excitonic effects \textit{via} a dynamical long-range linear exchange-correlation kernel reproduces the qualitative features of the second-harmonic response, but underestimates the experimentally reported magnitudes by nearly a factor of two. By incorporating three-particle (trionic) correlations through a static long-range quadratic exchange-correlation kernel, we achieve significantly improved quantitative agreement with experiment. These findings highlight the role of many-body interactions beyond the excitonic level in accurately describing second-order optical responses in two-dimensional semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-geometry-driven Mott transitions and magnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jixun K. Ding, Martin Claassen</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry quantifies how the single-particle Bloch wavefunction changes in phase and amplitude across the Brillouin Zone. In multi-orbital systems where bands have strongly mixed orbital composition, quantum geometry plays a vital role in determining the ground state and low-energy properties of interacting electronic systems. In this work, we show that Mott metal-insulator transitions, as well as transitions between different magnetic orders within the Mott insulating phase, can be driven by the quantum geometry of the underlying Bloch band, thereby providing a mechanism complementary to conventional bandwidth-tuned Mott transitions. By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We show that both transitions may be heuristically understood via non-local Coulomb scattering in a basis of exponentially localized Wannier functions. These results highlight the role of quantum geometry beyond topological settings as a governing principle for conventional Mott and magnetic physics in multi-orbital and moiré materials.</p>

            <h2>Moire Engineering of Cooper-Pair Density Modulation States</h2>

            <p>Cooper-pair density modulation (CPDM) states are superconducting phases in which the order parameter varies periodically in real space without breaking translational symmetry. Recently, moire superlattices in layered materials have emerged as powerful platforms for engineering charge density with tunable lattice symmetry, offering a new route to creating and controlling CPDM states. In this work, we demonstrate moire-induced CPDM states in a bilayer heterostructure formed by epitaxially stacking one quintuple layer (1 QL) of topological insulator Sb2Te3 on a six-unit-cell (6 UC) antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) measurements reveal a moiré superlattice formed between the hexagonal Te lattice of Sb2Te3 and the square Te lattice of FeTe, which spatially modulates the two superconducting gaps of the 1 QL Sb2Te3/6 UC FeTe bilayer. Our Josephson STM/S measurements provide direct real-space imaging of the CPDM states with a wavelength corresponding to the periodicity of the moire superlattice. By substituting Sb2Te3 with Bi2Te3, we achieve control over both the periodicity and magnitude of the CPDM states. Our work demonstrates an epitaxial strategy for synthesizing moire superlattices from materials with different crystal symmetries and reveals a new mechanism for engineering CPDM states in designer bilayer heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Monte Carlo study of the metal-insulator crossover in the square-lattice Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingzhong Lu, Yu-Feng Song, Youjin Deng, Yuan-Yao He</p>
            <p>The interaction-driven evolution from a Fermi liquid to a Mott insulator is a hallmark of strongly correlated fermion systems. In this work, we present a {\it numerically unbiased} study of such metal-to-insulator crossover in the half-filled square-lattice Hubbard model at finite temperatures, employing auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. By jointly analyzing thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish the crossover diagram of the model in the temperature-interaction ($T$-$U$) plane. With increasing $U$, our numerical results reveal an extended crossover regime, which we refer to as the {\it Bad Metal}, that separates the Fermi liquid and Mott insulator. During the crossover, we also examine the antiferromagnetic spin correlations and observe pronounced nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral functions. Furthermore, we investigate the temperature dependence of several commonly used observables in the model. As representative results, we achieve an accurate map of the thermal entropy across the crossover diagram, and identify the parameter regions in which the model exhibits the Pomeranchuk cooling, characterized by an adiabatic cooling with increasing $U$. Beyond offering a more refined understanding of the crossover phenomenon, our work also provides valuable benchmark and guideline for future optical lattice experiments on the square-lattice Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Highly Efficient Second/Third Harmonic Generation in van der Waals Layered Material AgScP2S6 with Anisotropic Polarization and Temperature Dependence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Yaseen Noor, Ryan Siebenaller, Wenhao Liu, Zixin Zhai, Conrad Kuz, Simin Zhang, Mousumi Upadhyay Kahaly, Gergely Nagy, Aamir Mushtaq, Rahul Rao, Emmanuel Rowe, Benjamin S. Conner, Bing Lv, Michael A. Susner, Enam Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nonlinear optical measurements, especially second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG) are comprehensively investigated for the van der Waals layered material AgScP2S6 with a non-centrosymmetric P31c (159) space group. Linear optical constants are extracted using spectroscopic ellipsometry and applied in fitting the harmonic generation behavior. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements exhibit pronounced anisotropy, with emission patterns well-described by theoretical models derived from the khi(2) and khi(3) tensor elements. The material demonstrates exceptionally high nonlinear susceptibilities, with khi(2) ~ 10^(-8) m/V and khi(3) ~ 10^(-17) m^2/V^2 which is a few orders of magnitude greater than comparable 2D materials reported in the literature. Temperature-dependent SHG and THG measurements from 300 K to 25 K reveal exponential decay in harmonic signal intensities, attributed to reduced carrier mobility, with no evidence of structural phase transitions, consistent with results from single crystal diffraction and heat capacity measurements. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements also reveal distinct orientation and ellipticity trends, highlighting the anisotropic nonlinear tensor contributions and contrasting polarization selection rules in the material. These results establish AgScP2S6 as a high-performance, thermally stable, and highly anisotropic nonlinear candidate material suitable for compact photonic applications such as ultrafast optical modulators, polarization-sensitive detectors, and wavelength-tunable light sources.</p>

            <h2>Light-enhanced dipolar interactions between exciton polaritons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasufumi Nakano, Olivier Bleu, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jesper Levinsen, Meera M. Parish</p>
            <p>We consider the scenario of excitons in a semiconductor bilayer that are strongly coupled to cavity photons, leading to the formation of dipolar exciton polaritons (dipolaritons). Using a realistic pseudopotential for the dipolar interactions, we exactly determine the scattering between dipolaritons, accounting for the hybridization between interlayer and intralayer excitons. Similar to conventional non-dipolar polaritons, we find that the light-matter coupling enhances the interactions between dipolaritons by forcing excitons to scatter at energies that would otherwise be forbidden in ordinary exciton-exciton collisions. However, we show that this light enhancement is larger for long-range dipolar interactions than for short-range intralayer interactions, and is sensitive to the (non-uniform) dielectric environment of the bilayer. Crucially, we find that the largest dipolariton interactions are achieved for transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers in vacuum. Our results thus reveal the optimal dipolariton setup for realizing strong photon correlations.</p>

            <h2>Generating ferro-spinetic polarizations in altermagnetic insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toshihiro Sato, Mengli Hu, Ion Cosma Fulga, Oleg Janson, Jorge I. Facio, Alessandro Stroppa, Fakher F. Assaad, Jeroen van den Brink</p>
            <p>Altermagnets are a novel class of fully spin-compensated magnetic materials that nevertheless have spin-split electronic bands, offering novel perspectives for spintronics applications. Based on a rigorous analysis of altermagnetic many-body models and their symmetry we establish the important role of two fundamental types of polarizations in altermagnetic insulators: the charge and the spinetic one, where the latter corresponds to a macroscopic spin-displacement field. First principles calculations confirm and quantify their presence in real materials. The two polarizations are directly coupled and emerge in orthogonal directions when inversion symmetry is broken, either by the system developing a spontaneously ferroelectric polarization (in ferroelectric altermagnets), or by a charge displacement induced by an external electric field (for inversion invariant altermagnetic insulators). This presence of large and switchable spin accumulations constitute an attractive fundamental feature of altermagnetic insulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arif Ullah, Rajibul Islam, Ghulam Hussain, Zahir Muhammad, Xiaoguang Li, Ming Yang</p>
            <p>Topological materials--including insulators (TIs) and semimetals (TSMs)--hold immense promise for quantum technologies, yet their discovery remains constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Here, we introduce TXL Fusion, a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates chemical heuristics, engineered physical descriptors, and large language model (LLM) embeddings to accelerate the discovery of topological materials. By incorporating features such as space group symmetry, valence electron configurations, and composition-derived metrics, TXL Fusion classifies materials across trivial, TSM, and TI categories with improved accuracy and generalization compared to conventional approaches. The framework successfully identified new candidates, with representative cases further validated through density functional theory (DFT), confirming its predictive robustness. By uniting data-driven learning with chemical intuition, TXL Fusion enables rapid and interpretable exploration of complex materials spaces, establishing a scalable paradigm for the intelligent discovery of next-generation topological and quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Interface Spin-orbit Coupling Induced Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Insulator</h2>

            <p>Fabricating room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this Letter, we report on the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films created through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling. This enhanced interfacial spin-orbit coupling strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new ferromagnetic insulating phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the ferromagnetic insulating phase can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our Letter reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna N. Morozovska, Eugene A. Eliseev, Richard (Yu)Liu, Sergei V. Kalinin, Dean R. Evans</p>
            <p>In contrast to hafnia (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain or defect engineering, reliable methods for controlling ferroelectricity are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and ferroelectric domains in these nanoparticles are also absent. To the best of our knowledge, stress-induced ferroelectric states in the HfO2 nanoparticles have not been explored. In this work, we study the influence of chemical stress on phase diagrams, dielectric and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional that includes trilinear and biquadratic couplings involving polar, antipolar, and nonpolar order parameters. The ferroelectric phase exhibits reentrant behavior as a function of nanoparticle size, such that the spontaneous polarization exists only within a limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min<R_c<R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is primarily determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects; the maximal critical radius R_cr^max is primarily determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Thus, this work identifies a stress-driven mechanism for reentrant ferroelectricity stabilization in nanoscale HfO2 systems, arising from the competition between depolarization field-induced suppression of ferroelectricity and its stabilization by shell-induced chemical stress. We revealed that relatively large compressive chemical strains are necessary to induce the ferroelectric phase in the HfO2 nanoparticles. Successful chemical strain engineering opens the way for significant enhancement of nanoscale HfO2 polar properties for applications in advanced memory cells and logic devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum critical behavior of cuprate superconductors observed by inelastic X-ray scattering</h2>

            <p>Progress toward a complete understanding of cuprate superconductors has been hindered by their intricate phase diagram, potentially linked to a quantum critical point (QCP). However, conclusive evidence for the QCP is lacking, as the presumed QCP is buried under the superconducting dome, disguising its presence. Here, we use high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to examine the dynamical charge-charge correlation in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and uncover the quantum critical scaling, a key feature required for a QCP. Specifically, \djh{we observed that the inverse correlation lengths for various dopings and temperatures collapsed onto a universal scaling curve, yielding a critical exponent $\nu$ of $0.74 \pm 0.08$. The non-negativity of this exponent confirms the presence of a QCP. Remarkably, the value of $\nu$ suggests that while the QCP is manifested through the charge-density wave, other orders also participate, such that the QCP appears to belong to the universality class characterized by the O(4) symmetry, reminiscent of the microscopic SO(4) symmetry in the Hubbard model at half-filling. Further analysis indicates that the QCP is highly dissipative with a short quasi-particle lifetime, reflecting the intertwined quantum fluctuations due to its being buried inside the superconducting state.</p>

            <h2>Quantization Mapping on Dirac Dynamics via Voltage-Driven Charge Density in Monolayer Graphene: A Klein Paradox and Entropy-Ruled Wavevector Mechanics Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karuppuchamy Navamani</p>
            <p>Thermodynamics coupled with quantum features on electron and hole dynamics in Dirac materials is quite interesting and crucial for real device applications. The correlation between the formation of electron-hole puddles in nearer to the charge neutrality point (CNP), and the role of disorder is fundamentally important for Dirac transport in graphene systems. Numerous studies on graphene further urge the necessity to find a better descriptor for disorder-charge puddles relation, which directly influences electrical conductivity. In principle, the external bias-driven energy level shift and its relevant density of states (DOS) provide information about the effect of total interactive potential on linear energy dispersion in terms of wavevector, but yet to be well-explored. With this ground, here we map the energy quantization for Dirac materials through the empirical relation of voltage-driven charge density in monolayer graphene, using the differential entropy (h)-ruled wavevector (k) mechanics. For this work, we propose the four postulates which are the key observable descriptions of earlier research reports, to study the precise electronic transport via an entropy-guided wavevector propagation approach, along with the Klein paradox, which pertains to the ultrafast dynamics in the Dirac or quasi-Dirac systems. The introduced h-ruled k and h-ruled N relations generalize the electron dynamics in both the unbounded and potentially bounded Dirac systems. Through the quantization mapping procedure under different voltage-driven potential (U=eV) boundary conditions, the observed energy shift from lower to excited quantum state obeys the relation of N(k)=N(U)^3; here, N(U) is the voltage-driven potential energy contribution factor for the quantum state existence. This study reveals information about the interaction potential-DOS relationship in the Dirac materials.</p>

            <h2>Discovering new photovoltaics using optimal transport theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew A. H. Walker, Zibo Zhou, Junayd Ul Islam, Keith T. Butler</p>
            <p>Searching by chemical and structural analogy is one of the most commonly used and successful approaches to materials discovery. However, formulating this task for algorithmic implementation raises the question of how we define similar materials. Methods have been proposed for searching materials space using vectors based on chemical composition and functional fragments in the material. Descriptors for structural similarity have also been proposed. However, the question of how to incorporate and balance structural and compositional similarity measures in a single metric remains open. Here, we adapt methods developed for calculating distances between undirected graphs and apply them to crystalline materials similarity. The Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric uses optimal transport theory to map between two graphs considering a balance of the graph structure and the information present at the nodes of the graph (atoms in crystals). We apply the method to exploring new photovoltaic materials. We demonstrate that FGW is competitive with embeddings from an equivariant graph neural network, trained on $> 10^6$ materials, despite minimal training. We then apply FGW to a discovery campaign to identify materials from the Materials Project database that have not previously been explored as photovoltaics, but have similarities to known high-efficiency materials. After validating predictions with hybrid density functional theory, we identify seven previously unexplored high-efficiency photovoltaic absorber candidates, including Cs$_5$Sb$_8$, which is found to have a predicted SLME of $> 30\%$ and to be thermodynamically stable. The FGW approach demonstrates the power of strong inductive biases for developing metrics for materials exploration with minimal training data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirja Granfors, Jesús Pineda, Blanca Zufiria Gerbolés, Joana B. Pereira, Carlo Manzo, Giovanni Volpe</p>
            <p>Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability poses significant challenges for analysis and classification. To address these challenges, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework designed to capture both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers linked through skip connections, which preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. Even though identical or highly similar underlying parameters describing a system's state can lead to significant variability in graph realizations, GAUDI consistently maps them into nearby regions of a structured and continuous latent space, effectively disentangling invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate GAUDI's versatility across multiple applications, including small-world networks modeling, characterization of protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analysis of collective motion in the Vicsek model, and identification of age-related changes in brain connectivity. Comparison with related approaches highlights GAUDI's superior performance in analyzing complex graphs, providing new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Complexity in Rule-Based Constrained Many-Body Models: Scars, Fragmentation, and Chaos</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arkaprava Sil, Sudipto Singha Roy</p>
            <p>Kinetic constraints in quantum many-body systems strongly restrict the accessible Hilbert space, giving rise to highly nontrivial dynamical behavior. In recent years, such systems have attracted growing interest as they provide insight into mechanisms of thermalization and into regimes where thermalization fails. In this work, we study a family of rule-based kinetically constrained models, including the celebrated Quantum Game of Life, from the perspective of quantum complexity, with a focus on entanglement, nonstabilizerness, and quantum chaos. Using spectral diagnostics such as level statistics and spectral form factors, we show that these models exhibit robust chaotic behavior while simultaneously supporting both strong and weak Hilbert-space fragmentation and quantum many-body scar states. To further elucidate the structure of these fragmented subspaces, we characterize them through their ability to generate quantum resources. In particular, we show that resource-generation capacity does not necessarily correlate with the dimensionality of a fragmented sector, and that entanglement structure and the ability to generate nonstabilizerness provide effective diagnostics for distinguishing dynamically disconnected sectors. Our work therefore explores kinetically constrained models in a general framework that is not restricted to Rydberg blockade-based constraints alone.</p>

            <h2>Apparatus to visualize flows in superfluid $^4$He below 1 K</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. Skachko, J. A. Hay, C. O. Goodwin, M. J. Doyle, W. Guo, P. M. Walmsley, A. I. Golov</p>
            <p>We describe a versatile apparatus for optical observations of experimental processes at temperatures down to 0.1 K. The cooling is achieved by a wet cryostat with a dilution refrigerator on a vibrationally-isolated platform, capable of continuous rotation at angular velocity of up to 3 rad/s. The illumination light beam from lasers on a non-rotating optical table at room temperature is introduced via an optical fiber. The images are transferred to the intensified camera at room temperature through a coherent bundle of $10^5$ optical fibers giving a spatial resolution of $\sim 30 \mu$m, depending on the magnification used. The adjustment of the position of the illumination light, as well as of the focusing of the camera on the object under investigation, can be controlled remotely with the help of piezoelectric positioners. The apparatus was used for visualization of particles dispersed in superfluid helium at temperatures down to 0.14 K. In one version of experiment, fluorescent light from clouds of excimer molecules He$_2^*$, generated in liquid helium by electron impact from electrons injected by sharp field-emission tips, was recorded and analyzed. In another, fluorescent particles of diameters between 1 $\mu$m and 6 $\mu$m were initially loaded onto the horizontal surface of a piezoelectric crystal of LiNbO$_3$ and then injected into liquid helium by short bursts of high-amplitude oscillations at the crystal's resonant frequency 1 MHz. The particle trajectories were filmed at a frame rate of up to 990 fps and analyzed.</p>

            <h2>Non adiabatic dynamics of the ferroelectric soft mode</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gili Scharf, Lara Donval, Leah Ben Gur, Alon Ron</p>
            <p>Most microscopic descriptions of structural dynamics assume the Born-Oppenheimer separation, where electrons adjust adiabatically to ionic motion. When this separation breaks down, electronic and lattice degrees of freedom can evolve on different timescales, giving rise to new physical phenomena beyond the adiabatic limit. Here we use time-resolved, phase-sensitive second-harmonic generation and pump-probe reflectivity to reshape the ferroelectric free-energy landscape of SnTe while separately tracking polar order and coherent lattice motion. When photoexcitation transiently suppresses the double-well barrier, polarization dynamics become strongly nonlinear, while the coherent phonon dynamics remain harmonic. This decoupling cannot be described by a single adiabatic coordinate for the electronic polarization and ionic positions. We provide a unifying physical description for the non adiabatic dynamics of the ferroelectric mode and the mixed displacive/order-disorder nature of SnTe based on a separation of scales for the renormalization of the ferroelectric stiffness.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropy reduction and tunability of hole-spin qubit g-factor in strained parabolic Ge/SiGe quantum wells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. K. L. Colmenar, Arthur Lin, Omadillo Abdurazakov, Yun-Pil Shim, Garnett W. Bryant, Charles Tahan</p>
            <p>Hole-spin qubits in planar Ge/SiGe heterostructures have attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their favorable electrical characteristics and prolonged coherence times. However, the strong spin-orbit interaction also makes them susceptible to charge noise and inhomogeneous strain. This is further exacerbated by the highly anisotropic g-factor of the planar design. Although there are some known strategies to suppress charge noise, one approach is to engineer an isotropic g-factor. In this work we analyze how qubit confinement profile affects the g-factor of hole-spin qubits. We show that decreasing the characteristic in-plane qubit confinement length reduces the g-factor anisotropy. We perform analytical and numerical analysis to compare two types of quantum wells: square wells and parabolic wells. We show that square wells have limited tunability, while parabolic wells offer broader tunability, making them more promising for qubit engineering.</p>

            <h2>Ab Initio Random Matrix Theory of Molecular Electronic Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Tao, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>We use ab initio electronic-structure methods to investigate random-matrix theory (RMT) universality in molecular electronic structure. Using single-reference electronic structure methods, including Hartree-Fock, configuration-interaction singles (CIS), density functional theory, and linear-response time-dependent density-functional theory, we compute single-particle orbital energies and many-electron excitations of several representative molecules (benzene, alanine, 1-phenylethylamine, methyloxirane, and helicene chains). For generic low-symmetry geometries, the unfolded spectra of these ab initio Hamiltonians exhibit Wigner-Dyson level statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). For extended helicene chains we explicitly restrict to bound valence excitations below the ionization threshold and still observe GOE statistics, indicating that the RMT universality is present for physical states of direct relevance to real molecules. We further explore the electric and magnetic field dependence of the molecular electronic spectra. The variance of electric polarizability (level curvature K) is predicted to be non-analytic in the magnetic field which serves as an infrared cutoff, <K^2> proportional to log(1/|B|). We observe a transition to the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) by increasing the magnetic fields, although it occurs only at magnetic fields far beyond experimentally accessible scales. Our results indicate that random matrix universality provides a general framework for organizing ab initio predictions of interacting electron spectra in complex systems.</p>

            <h2>Using near-flat-band electrons for read-out of molecular spin qubit entangled states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Bunker, Silas Hoffman, Shuanglong Liu, Xiao-Guang Zhang, Hai-Ping Cheng</p>
            <p>While molecular spin qubits (MSQs) are a promising platform for quantum computing, read-out has been largely limited to electron paramagnetic resonance which is often slow and requires a global system drive. Moreover, because one prerequisite for the Elzerman and Pauli spin blockade readout mechanisms typical of semiconductor spin qubits is tunneling of electrons between sites, these read-out modalities are unavailable in MSQs. Here, we theoretically demonstrate electrical read-out of entangled MSQs via driven many-electron spin unpolarized currents. In particular, using a time-dependent density matrix renormalization group approach we simulate a maximally entangled MSQ pair between two electronic leads. Driving itinerant electrons between the two leads, we find that the conductance is greater when the MSQs are in the entangled singlet state as compared to the entangled triplet state. This contrast in conductance is enhanced when the electronic density of states at the Fermi energy is large and for narrow bandwidth. Our results are readily applicable to molecules supramolecularly functionalizing semiconductors with relatively flat bands such as single-wall carbon nanotubes under a magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Planar germanium is currently the only semiconducting platform where high-coherence spin qubits and proximity-induced superconductivity have each been demonstrated. Recent research into spin qubits in Ge/SiGe heterostructures has focused on increasing the thickness of the SiGe capping layer, reporting improvements in the electrostatic noise levels. Meanwhile, heterostructures with thinner capping layers remain rather unexplored, despite the potential advantages for proximity-induced superconductivity. Here, we study a Ge/SiGe heterostructure with a thin SiGe cap $d \approx 4\ \mathrm{nm}$ and investigate its viability to host low-noise quantum dots. To keep the thermal budget compatible with superconducting layers, low-temperature oxide deposition processes were developed and implemented for the gate dielectrics. The charge-noise level of fabricated devices is estimated to be $1.8 \pm 1.0\ \mu\mathrm{eV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, comparable to devices fabricated on shallow heterostructures $\left(d \sim 20\ \mathrm{nm}\right)$ with high-temperature deposited oxides. Low charge-noise levels, together with the straightforward integration of superconductors, make this heterostructure an attractive platform for prototyping hybrid semiconducting-superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>In superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures, superconductivity and spin polarization are competing effects because magnetic fields break Cooper pairs. They can be combined using thin films and in-plane magnetic fields, an approach that enabled the pursuit of Majorana zero modes, Kitaev chains, and Andreev spin qubits (ASQs), but remains challenging for materials with small in-plane g-factors. Here we show that granular aluminum (grAl), composed of nanometer-scale aluminum grains embedded in an amorphous oxide matrix, can overcome this limitation. By depositing grAl on Ge/SiGe heterostructures, we induce a hard superconducting gap with BCS peaks at 305 $\mu$eV and magnetic-field resilience for both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, allowing Zeeman splitting of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states beyond 50 $\mu$eV (12 GHz). Leveraging this robustness, we reveal signatures of hole physics and demonstrate g-tensor tunability.</p>

            <p>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals ubiquitous quasiparticle ``kinks'' near $\sim$70 meV and $\sim$40 meV across cuprate superconductors, often accompanied by peak--dip--hump (PDH) structures. These features point to strong coupling between electrons and low-energy bosonic excitations, but the microscopic origin has remained elusive due to the limitations of conventional density-functional theory (DFT) and the high cost of beyond-DFT methods. Here, we systematically study the electron--phonon coupling (EPC) in hole-doped infinite-layer CaCuO$_2$ using the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) density functional, explicitly including magnetic effects. We find a substantial EPC strength $\lambda$ of $\sim$0.5 in the magnetic phase, producing kinks and PDH structures in the 40-80~meV window in excellent agreement with experiments. The dominant contribution arises from rotational oxygen phonons, while breathing modes contribute little. Our results establish strong EPC in cuprates, highlight the key role of rotational phonons, and provide a framework for understanding spectral anomalies in cuprates and beyond.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets offer a unique pathway to functional spintronics by combining vanishing magnetization with large spin splitting. Here, we demonstrate that the canonical d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O can deliver giant tunneling magnetoresistance through orientation-dependent spin filtering. By analyzing the crystallographic spin segregation, we show that transport along specific crystallographic axes is nearly fully spin-polarized within the symmetry-protected ballistic channels. We implement this mechanism in a lattice-matched KV2Se2O/Bi2O2Se/KV2Se2O magnetic tunnel junction, which achieves a robust half-metallic transport regime. The symmetry-protected spectral gap in the parallel/anti-parallel configuration ensures a high tunneling magnetoresistance ratio, resulting in substantial tunneling magnetoresistance, robust thermally driven spin filtering, and spin Seebeck effect at room temperature. These findings provide a path of altermagnetic heterostructures as a high-performance platform for scalable, field-free, and thermally stable spin logic.</p>

            <p>Schottky junctions based on transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have emerged as key building blocks for next-generation optoelectronic devices that demand ultrafast response and high sensitivity. However, the ultrafast, nanoscale carrier dynamics at these interfaces, crucial for device performance, have remained experimentally elusive. Here, we introduce optical pump-probe time-resolved atomic force microscopy to directly visualize, in real space, the nanosecond-scale modulation of the Schottky barrier potential at a van der Waals junction formed by point contact between WSe2 and a PtIr tip. Complementary analyses using transient absorption spectroscopy and light-modulated current-voltage characteristics together with model simulations reveal that time-resolved currents originate from the concerted temporal evolution of photoexcited carriers and the subsequent barrier response, processes that also define the rate-limiting steps of the photocurrent. Our results uncover the essential interfacial dynamics that underpin TMDC-based photodetectors and photovoltaic elements, while establishing a new measurement paradigm that complements and extends existing spectroscopic techniques. This approach provides direct access to nonequilibrium processes hidden at nanoscale interfaces, offering a powerful route to rational design of high-performance optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>Oxygen transport membranes (OTMs), enabling catalytic reaction and gas separation, support crucial chemical engineering processes and decarbonization technologies, but their applications are hindered by limited oxygen permeation fluxes and inadequate long-term stability during operation. Here, a series of high-entropy perovskite OTMs based on La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 were designed and synthesized by the simple sol-gel method. The impact of varying doping ratios on the structure, surface morphology, oxygen permeability, and stability of these high-entropy OTMs was thoroughly examined. At 950 °C, the optimal composition, La0.25Sr0.25Gd0.2Nd0.2Pr0.1CoO3, achieved oxygen permeation fluxes of 1.62 mL min-1 cm-2 under air/He gradient and 1.46 mL min-1 cm-2 under air/CO2, respectively. Remarkably, all high-entropy OTMs demonstrated stable operation for over 100 h in a pure CO2 environment without a significant decline in performance. This finding paves a new way to enhance the structural and oxygen permeation stability of OTMs, and further promotes the application of OTMs in oxy-fuel combustion technologies aimed at improving CO2 capture and storage efficiency.</p>

            <p>Solid-state refrigeration technologies, represented by electrocaloric effect (ECE), are renowned for zero global-warming-potential and high cooling efficiency. Synergistically achieving high electrocaloric effect ({\Delta}T) and wide temperature span ({\Delta}Tspan) for EC materials takes a leapfrog toward practical cooling applications, typical for integrated circuits. Guided by phase-field simulation, Ba(Ti, Hf)O3 dubbed as a polar wrench, establishes polar frustration by setting up local stress field and manipulating octahedral oxygen tilt (OOT) in NaNbO3-based relaxor. The resultant P4bm framework entails short-range and highly-polar ferrodistortive nanodomains, i.e., the abundant highly-polar nanodomains facilitate to increase entropy change and robust OOT enables to impede thermal perturbations. Consequently, a large {\Delta}T of 0.85 K and 0.70 K with an ultrawide {\Delta}Tspan of 118 K and 130 K is obtained, contributing to an ultrahigh figure of merit of > 90 K2 in NaNbO3-Ba(Ti, Hf)O3, significantly outperforms its counterparts. The local structure responsible for robust EC performances are decrypted through 2D information from atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscope, 3D big-box model constructed from neutron total scattering and DFT calculations. These findings highlight that polar frustration strategy in ferrodistortive relaxor enables to pioneer emergent EC performances, and also unearth potential entropy-change-based ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials beyond.</p>

            <p>Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly applied beyond natural language processing, demonstrating strong capabilities in complex scientific tasks that traditionally require human expertise. This progress has extended into materials discovery, where LLMs introduce a new paradigm by leveraging reasoning and in-context learning, capabilities absent from conventional machine learning approaches. Here, we present a Multi-Agent-based Electrocatalyst Search Through Reasoning and Optimization (MAESTRO) framework in which multiple LLMs with specialized roles collaboratively discover high-performance single atom catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. Within an autonomous design loop, agents iteratively reason, propose modifications, reflect on results and accumulate design history. Through in-context learning enabled by this iterative process, MAESTRO identified design principles not explicitly encoded in the LLMs' background knowledge and successfully discovered catalysts that break conventional scaling relations between reaction intermediates. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks as a powerful strategy to generate chemical insight and discover promising catalysts.</p>

            <p>We investigate the interplay between complex magnetic orders and topological electronic states in nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetals on the ReAlX family (Re is a rare earth element and X is Si or Ge). We construct a lattice model incorporating conduction Weyl fermions coupled to localized magnetic moments via Kondo interaction. By considering a multi-${\bf Q}$ cycloid magnetic configuration, which can evolve into a Skyrmion lattice under an in-plane Zeeman field, we analyze its profound impact on the band structure through magnetic Brillouin zone and band-folding. Using the Kubo formula, we calculate the conductivity tensor and examine the transport properties in the clean limit. Our results reveal that the Skyrmion lattice induces significant changes in electrical and Hall conductivities. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent resistivity deviates from the standard Fermi-liquid behavior ($\rho_{xx}\sim T^2$), showing a power-law scaling ($\rho_{xx}\sim T^\alpha$ with $\alpha$ between 3 and 5), indicative of non-Fermi liquid behavior. This work provides a theoretical framework connecting multi-${\bf Q}$ magnetic textures, Skyrmion physics, and anomalous transport in topological semimetals.</p>

This problem is equivalent to constructing a $d$-dimensional hypercubic jungle gym, at all junctions of which $2d$ rods with different colours meet. The analysis reveals a unique feature of the $d = 3$ case: the forced presence of at least one perfectly-ordered (singly coloured) direction (axis), in contrast to the possible absence of such a direction in $d \ge 4$. However, we will show that the uniaxial order is overwhelming not only in $d = 3$ but also for $d \ge 4$ in a sufficiently large system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amar Fakhredine, Giuseppe Cuono, Jan Skolimowski, Silvia Picozzi, Carmine Autieri</p>
            <p>We investigate the interplay between relativistic spin-momentum locking arising from altermagnetism and various forms of inversion symmetry breaking. Depending on the symmetry breaking, this can give rise to Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Weyl-type SOC, or the coexistence of two distinct spin-momentum lockings. We focus on the altermagnetic Ca2RuO4 as a testbed material. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed ground state, which is an A-centered magnetic order with the Neel vector along the b-axis, hosting spin cantings along the a- and c-axes but without weak ferromagnetism. Ca2RuO4 exhibits relativistic spin-momentum locking, with different even-parity wave orders for the three spin components. We interpret the experimental results on doped samples as evidence for a transition from a pure altermagnetic phase to a weak ferromagnetic phase. Under ferroelectric- and antiferroelectric-like distortions, there are no qualitative changes in the non-relativistic spin-momentum locking and in the weak ferromagnetism. However, we observe the rise of the Rashba or Weyl-type SOC. Using numerical and analytical models, we investigate which nodal planes persist when inversion symmetry is broken in the relativistic case. The spin-momentum locking of the other components adopt a p-wave character in the case of Rashba; in contrast, Weyl-type SOC disrupts all nodal planes, leaving only nodal lines. Finally, to simulate a stripe phase with structural distortions along the z-axis, we studied a modulated electric field inducing atomic displacements within one Ca2RuO4 layer. This produces a magnetic phase transition to an exotic altermagnetic state with two non-relativistic spin-momentum lockings hosting weak ferromagnetism. Our research presents a comprehensive analysis of various possible scenarios in altermagnets with breaking of inversion symmetries under relativistic effects</p>

            <p>The position noise spectra of six drums on a single chip were measured on a single cooldown below 1.3 kelvin. Cryostat temperatures as low as 0.7 mK were achieved. The temperature dependence of the resonance frequency and linewidth of the drum modes was analyzed in the framework of the tunneling two level system (TLS) model. Departures of the resonance frequency and the position noise power from the expected logarithmic and linear temperature dependences, respectively, were interpreted as indications of thermal decoupling from the cryostat. This previously unexplored measurement configuration revealed that similar neighboring drums on a single chip may be at different temperatures. At the lowest temperatures, some drums exhibited excess damping that decreased with temperature. The magnitude of the excess damping of the drums was correlated with the thermal coupling of their TLS to the cryostat. In the case of one drum, a temporary increase in its damping coincided with a decrease in its mode temperature. The thermalization of the TLS to the cold finger was independent of pump power, pulse tube state and temperature of the pre-cooling stages of the cryostat. These results reveal an interplay between TLS damping and thermalization of nanomechanics that motivates further theoretical work and may impact efforts to extend the coherence of mechanical resonators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza F. Behbahani</p>
            <p>We study stress relaxation in several types of entangled monodisperse linear polymer melts by comparing the shear stress relaxation modulus, $G(t)$, with the end-to-end vector autocorrelation function, $P(t)$. The study includes three Kremer-Grest bead-spring models with varying chain stiffness, as well as a chemistry-specific coarse-grained model of \emph{cis}-1,4-polybutadiene. For each model, multiple chain lengths were simulated, spanning a range of $N/N_e = 5$-$50$ entanglements per chain. We observe that in all cases the behavior of $G(t)$, beyond the short-time Rouse regime, is accurately described by $G^0_{\mathrm{N}}[P(t)]^2$, where the chain-length-independent prefactor $G^0_{\mathrm{N}}$ denotes the plateau modulus. This correlation is consistent with both double reptation and dynamic tube dilation models of polymer relaxation, although the two models are based on different physical pictures. The double reptation model represents the melt as a transient network in which stress relaxation is governed by the survival probability of pairwise entanglements. The dynamic tube dilation model, however, assumes that the tube of constraints surrounding a polymer chain progressively enlarges as relaxation proceeds. The relation $G(t) = G^0_\mathrm{N}[P(t)]^2$ can serve as a basis for determining the plateau modulus and the corresponding entanglement length. It also simplifies the modeling of $G(t)$, since an accurate analytical expression for $P(t)$ is sufficient to describe the long-time behavior of $G(t)$. We further compare the simulation data for $P(t)$ and $G(t)$ with theoretical predictions.</p>

            <p>We present an analytically solvable minimal model for the relaxation of low-frequency magnons in magnetic insulators arising from magnon-phonon and magnon-magnon interactions. The model establishes a direct connection between microscopic relaxation processes and Gilbert damping, and reveals how magnon decay evolves from bulk systems to the monolayer limit. We find that magnon-phonon coupling produces Gilbert damping of comparable magnitude in three- and two-dimensional magnets, with qualitative differences between flexural phonons in free-standing monolayers and three-dimensional phonons in substrate-supported layers. By contrast, non-Gilbert damping due to four-magnon scattering is strongly enhanced in two dimensions, where it becomes independent of spin-orbit coupling. To benchmark the model against real materials, we introduce a numerical approach for computing magnon damping from ab initio-derived spin Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the central conclusions of the model remain valid for magnons in bulk YIG and in a monolayer of the van der Waals magnetic insulator CrSBr.</p>

While time averages extract transport properties from long stationary trajectories and discard transient dynamics, TTCF adopts the complementary strategy: it exploits the information contained in short-time transients following the onset of an external perturbation, while discarding the long-time evolution once stationarity is reached. We revisit the theoretical framework of TTCF and assess its numerical performance through representative case studies, the Lorentz gas and a many-body system, namely a chain of oscillators with anharmonic pinning potential. By direct comparison with time averages, we show that for the Lorentz gas TTCF yields consistent transport coefficients in both linear and nonlinear regimes at a reduced computational cost. Moreover, the TTCF displays superior precision in the linear-response regime, and remains reliable in non-ergodic situations, revealing the presence of regions of phase space corresponding to different behaviors, as well as the possibility of phase transitions. For the anharmonic chain, we show that TTCF is a scalable and efficient alternative for the numerical study of nonequilibrium transport.</p>

            <h2>Geometric oscillations of local Hall and Nernst effects in ballistic graphene at weak magnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Z. Z. Alisultanov, A. V. Kavokin</p>
            <p>We predict a novel class of magnetotransport oscillations in ballistic graphene specific for a ring-shape geometry. Using the Büttiker-Landauer formalism, we analytically obtain the local Hall and Nernst coefficients in the weak-field ballistic regime. These coefficients exhibit pronounced oscillations as functions of both the magnetic field and the angular positions of the measurement probes. The oscillations originate from the discrete set of skipping orbits that geometrically connect the contacts, with resonances occurring when the angular separation between contacts times the radius of the disk equals an integer number of cyclotron diameters. Unlike conventional quantum oscillations in conductivity, this effect is robust at room temperature and can dominate local thermoelectric signals. This geometric control of ballistic flow provides a platform for studying electron hydrodynamics and engineering phase-coherent devices, with potential applications in sensitive terahertz detectors and thermal management systems.</p>

            <h2>Tighter thermalization bounds for perturbed quantum many-body scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng-Yun Mao, Zhixiang Sun, Wen-Long You</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional eigenstates that defy thermalization, enabling long-lived coherent dynamics in strongly interacting systems. However, their stability under perturbations remains inadequately understood. In this work, we derive improved lower bounds on the thermalization time of QMBS under local perturbations with strength $\lambda$. Using both numerical simulations and analytical reasoning, we show that exact QMBS exhibit slow thermalization, with a timescale scaling as $\tau \sim \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{-1/d})$ owing to the stabilizing restricted spectrum-generating algebra (RSGA), which is a significant improvement over previous bounds (e.g., $\tau \sim \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{-1/(d+1)})$). Counterintuitively, approximate QMBS can thermalize even more slowly under generic perturbations, exhibiting $\tau \sim \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{-2})$ scaling due to second-order perturbative effects in the absence of such protective structure. These distinct thermalization behaviors clarify how exact and approximate scars maintain coherence. Our work advances previous findings by establishing a tighter bound on the thermalization time, clarifying when scarred dynamics remain long-lived under weak but generic perturbations.</p>

            <p>In the era of big data and the Internet of Things, quantum-level control of conductance states offers a promising route toward high-density data storage and brain-inspired neuromorphic computing. Although quantum conductance (QC) phenomena have been demonstrated in various metal oxide memristors, achieving reliable and precise control over quantized states remains in its infancy. Here, we demonstrate bidirectional quantum conductance states in multifunctional BiFeO3 (BFO) perovskite memristors integrated with multilayer-graphene contacts, enabling higher-order tunability and revealing the potential of perovskite-2D heterostructures for quantum-engineered memory and computing devices. XPS analysis provides detailed insights into oxygen vacancy dynamics in BFO, whereas first-principles density functional theory calculations clearly reveal a strong localized electric field at the graphene-BFO interface. Our devices exhibit current-controlled higher-order QC transitions facilitated by quantum point contact formation, giving rise to quantized conductance states during both SET and RESET processes. Time-lag correlation maps quantify the stochastic evolution of QC states under dynamic voltage-pulse tuning schemes. Notably, the quantized conductance states effectively emulate synaptic potentiation and depression, enabling precise weight modulation for high-accuracy image and digit recognition in convolutional neural networks. These findings establish perovskite-2D heterostructures as promising candidates for QC-driven resistive switching and demonstrate their potential for developing controllable quantum memristors.</p>

            <h2>Crystallography-driven molecularization of a two-dimensional spin-$3/2$ magnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hari Borutta, Tobias Müller, Ronny Thomale, Harald O. Jeschke, Yasir Iqbal</p>
            <p>Large-spin two-dimensional magnets are generally expected to develop conventional long-range order once the dominant exchange scale becomes appreciable. The layered spin-$3/2$ maple-leaf compound Na$_2$Mn$_3$O$_7$ defies this expectation: despite sizable antiferromagnetic interactions and no evident disorder, it exhibits no magnetic ordering and displays two well-separated thermodynamic crossover scales. We show that this behavior originates from a crystallography-driven molecularization of the magnetic degrees of freedom. The low-symmetry structure partitions the Mn sublattice into inequivalent exchange pathways, generating a pronounced hierarchy that nearly isolates antiferromagnetic hexagons. Magnetic correlations therefore develop in two stages: first within individual hexagons at a scale set by the dominant exchange, and only at much lower temperatures do frustrated inter-hexagon couplings attempt to establish coherence across the lattice. While isolated hexagons reproduce the two-step thermodynamic structure, the experimentally relevant temperature scales emerge only once the hexagons are embedded in the frustrated two-dimensional network. The resulting quantum ground state is magnetically disordered, characterized by strong intra-hexagon correlations and rapidly decaying inter-hexagon correlations. These results identify crystallographic inequivalence as a materials-level mechanism for stabilizing molecularized and quantum-disordered states even in large-spin two-dimensional magnets.</p>

            <p>The Drude weight characterizes ballistic transport in quantum many-body systems, yet a comprehensive understanding and exact analytical results for it remain elusive, especially in multi-component quantum gases. In this work, we leverage Generalized Hydrodynamics and the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz method to precisely compute the Drude weights of one-dimensional continuous integrable systems, such as the Lieb-Liniger model and the Bose-Fermi mixture model. We establish an exact, universal relationship between components of the Drude weight matrix and fundamental thermodynamic quantities (e.g., particle, enthalpy, and entropy densities) for the constituent particles with distinct statistics undergo dynamic coupling. For both models, we further derive analytical approximations of the Drude weight in distinct physical regimes and identify universal scaling laws for the Drude weight near quantum phase this http URL, to connect theory with experiment, we propose and simulate two feasible measurement protocols--a linear potential quench and a bipartitioning setup-verifying that they can reliably extract the Drude weights. Our results establish a direct link between macroscopic transport phenomena and microscopic quasiparticle structure, furnishing critical theoretical benchmarks for future ultracold atomic gas experiments.</p>

            <p>Ag(I)-Bi(III)-based semiconductors have gained substantial attention as nontoxic, stable alternatives to lead-halide perovskites for optoelectronics, but are widely limited by carrier localization, which severely restricts diffusion lengths. The most efficient Ag/Bi solar absorber is AgBiS2, but diffusion lengths in nanocrystal films are <50 nm. Carrier localization in this rock-salt (Fm-3m) system is believed to arise from cation disorder, and so we herein investigate the layered cation-ordered analogue. Through beyond-DFT simulations combined with neutron and X-ray powder diffraction, we reveal that off-centring of Ag+ and Bi3+ cations is energetically-favoured in this cation-ordered phase. Despite local distortions in the AgS6 and BiS6 octahedra, band-like transport takes place, which, surprisingly, also occurs in the cation-disordered rock-salt phase when these materials are made as bulk powders. The cubic-phase powders have the same degree of cation disorder as the nanocrystals that have carrier localization, which suggests that extrinsic factors play a determining role. We ascribe the intrinsic band-like transport of both phases of AgBiS2 to its close packing, ensuring high electronic dimensionality. These insights offer pathways for designing solar absorbers avoiding carrier localization limitations, and call for future efforts to enhance the efficiency of AgBiS2 photovoltaics to focus on large-grained thin films, or improved nanocrystal surface passivation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew A. H. Walker, Zibo Zhang, Junayd Ul Islam, Keith T. Butler</p>
            <p>Searching by chemical and structural analogy is one of the most commonly used and successful approaches to materials discovery. However, formulating this task for algorithmic implementation raises the question of how we define similar materials. Methods have been proposed for searching materials space using vectors based on chemical composition and functional fragments in the material. Descriptors for structural similarity have also been proposed. However, the question of how to incorporate and balance structural and compositional similarity measures in a single metric remains open. Here, we adapt methods developed for calculating distances between undirected graphs and apply them to crystalline materials similarity. The Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric uses optimal transport theory to map between two graphs considering a balance of the graph structure and the information present at the nodes of the graph (atoms in crystals). We apply the method to exploring new photovoltaic materials. We demonstrate that FGW is competitive with embeddings from an equivariant graph neural network, trained on $> 10^6$ materials, despite minimal training. We then apply FGW to a discovery campaign to identify materials from the Materials Project database that have not previously been explored as photovoltaics, but have similarities to known high-efficiency materials. After validating predictions with hybrid density functional theory, we identify seven previously unexplored high-efficiency photovoltaic absorber candidates, including Cs$_5$Sb$_8$, which is found to have a predicted SLME of $> 30\%$ and to be thermodynamically stable. The FGW approach demonstrates the power of strong inductive biases for developing metrics for materials exploration with minimal training data.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamics of Dense Active Fluids: Turbulence-Like States and the Role of Advected Activity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sandip Sahoo, Siddhartha Mukherjee, Samriddhi Sankar Ray</p>
            <p>Dense suspensions of self-propelled bacteria and related active fluids exhibit spontaneous flow generation, vortex formation, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics despite operating at vanishingly small Reynolds numbers. These phenomena, commonly referred to as active turbulence, display striking visual and statistical similarities to classical inertial turbulence while arising from fundamentally different nonequilibrium mechanisms. In this article, we present a combined review and theoretical study of hydrodynamic models for dense active fluids, with particular emphasis on bacterial suspensions described by the Toner--Tu--Swift--Hohenberg (TTSH) framework. We review key experimental and theoretical developments underlying the analogy between active and inertial turbulence, highlighting the emergence of multiple dynamical regimes and the conditions under which universal spectral and intermittent behavior arises in homogeneous systems. Moving beyond the conventional assumption of spatially uniform activity, we introduce a minimal model in which the activity field is heterogeneous and dynamically advected by the flow it generates. Thus treating activity as a spatiotemporally evolving field coupled to the TTSH dynamics, we investigate how advection and diffusion lead to sharp activity fronts, confinement of turbulent motion, and complex interfacial morphologies. Our numerical results demonstrate that spatial variations in activity can induce transient coexistence of distinct spectral regimes and that universality in active turbulence is inherently local and time-dependent in heterogeneous systems. These findings underscore the importance of treating activity as a dynamical field in its own right and provide a framework for studying active turbulence in more realistic, spatially structured biological and synthetic active matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Micellar effects on Ostwald ripening in emulsions: Transition from cubic to quadratic particle size growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexey Kabalnov</p>
            <p>Ostwald ripening in O/W emulsions in presence of solubilizing micelles is theoretically studied. At small average sizes, the kinetics is predicted to follow the classical Lifshits-Slezov-Wagner cubic law, with the rate proportional to the molecular solubility of the oil in water, as if no micelles were present. At larger particle sizes the kinetics transitions to the Wagner's quadratic law. The crossover point for the kinetics depends on the dynamics of the oil solubilizate-micelle exchange; it is set by the value of the oil atmosphere distribution parameter, kappa, which, somewhat like Debye length, is proportional to the square root of the micellar concentration. It should be noted that in the range when 1/kappa is close to the particle average radius, the ripening kinetics still nearly follows the cubic law, with only moderate deviations; in this case, the micellar effects are experimentally seen not as the deviations from the linearity, but as an apparent increase in the cubic rate. The increase is predicted to be larger in case of nonionic micelles of ethylene oxide type compared to ionic ones.</p>

In this work, we present a quantitative theoretical description of the matter-wave dynamics based on a tailored implementation of the self-consistent theory of localization, which incorporates both the spectral and spatial properties of the state prepared in the disorder. We benchmark this theoretical approach against ab initio numerical simulations, and use it to analyze the atom density profiles observed experimentally in the localized, diffusive, and critical regimes. Particular emphasis is placed on the key role of the atomic energy distribution, especially on the distinct contributions of Bose-condensed and thermal atoms to interpret the experimental profiles. Our framework provides a versatile and efficient theoretical toolbox for quantitatively describing wave-packet dynamics in three-dimensional disordered quantum systems, which remain challenging for state-of-the-art large-scale numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>Ultra-stable glasses prepared from the physical vapor deposition of organic molecules present a very low density of two-level states, the kind of glass defects that determine their peculiar low temperature thermal properties. Numerical simulations suggest that quasi-localized harmonic vibrational modes emerge in the soft regions associated with two-level states. However, the connection between the low frequency vibrational modes and the local structural instabilities of glasses remains unexplained. Here we exploit a recently developed spectrograph for nuclear resonant analysis of inelastic X-ray scattering to probe the density of vibrational states of amorphous thin films of ultra-stable and conventional glasses down to an exceptionally low frequency of $\sim 70$ GHz. We show that the glass stability does not affect the harmonic vibrational modes at the lowest frequencies, despite a reduction of almost an order of magnitude in the density of two-level states. At the same time, the vibrational modes at higher frequencies, around the boson peak maximum, are extremely sensitive to the glass stability. Although we cannot exclude the possible existence of quasi-localized modes in glasses, we show that their presence is not strictly necessary to describe the measured density of low frequency vibrations. The experimental developments here presented pave the way to the solution to the long-standing debate on the low frequency vibrations in glasses.</p>

            <p>The resistivity maximum at a temperature $T=T_{\mathrm{max}}$ is a recurring feature of bandwidth-tuned Mott systems, yet its meaning remains controversial: is it a coherence-incoherence crossover of an electronically homogeneous metal, or does it mark the onset of transport through a mixed landscape of metallic and insulating regions? Even more debated is whether a true phase-coexistence regime survives in the relevant parameter range, or whether apparent inhomogeneity is merely extrinsic. Here we address these questions by moving beyond temperature sweeps and probe charge transport in the time domain. Near $T=T_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that the resistance of a model system, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott spin liquid material, exhibits clear random-telegraph switching between discrete levels over long timescales. The statistics of the switching - sharp two-level behavior with thermally activated dwell times - point to a mesoscopic "current-controlling" region that dynamically toggles between metallic and insulating states, intermittently opening and closing the dominant conduction channel. This characteristic fluctuating dynamics provides direct evidence for intrinsic metal-insulator coexistence and establishes $T\sim T_{\mathrm{max}}$ as the regime of Mott intermittency, where transport is governed by stochastic domain switching rather than quasiparticle decoherence.</p>

            <p>Representing the time-evolution operator as a tensor network constitutes a key ingredient in several algorithms for studying quantum lattice systems at finite temperature or in a non-equilibrium setting. For a Hamiltonian composed of strictly short-ranged interactions, the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition is the main technique for obtaining such a representation. In [B.~Vanhecke, L.~Vanderstraeten and F.~Verstraete, Physical Review A, L020402 (2021)], an alternative strategy, the cluster expansion, was introduced. This approach naturally preserves internal and lattice symmetries and can more easily be extended to higher-order representations or longer-ranged interactions. We extend the cluster expansion to two-dimensional fermionic systems, and employ it to construct projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO) approximations of Gibbs states. We also discuss and benchmark different truncation schemes for multiplying layers of PEPOs together. Applying the resulting framework to a two-dimensional spinless fermion model with attractive interactions, we resolve a clear phase boundary at finite temperature.</p>

            <p>Programmable microheater arrays are essential for a variety of applications including gas sensing, microfluidic lab on a chip devices, 3D printers, and biosensors that rely on DNA amplification. Increasing the density and number of heating elements directly correlates with the precision with which spatiotemporal heat profiles can be delivered. However, large arrays have thus far not been realized. One challenge is that as the number of elements in an array increases, the complexity of connecting them grows. Here, we show that row-column addressing provides a promising architecture for the efficient operation of a large micro-heater array. We introduce a programmable 32 x 32 microheater array consisting of individually addressable robust platinum (Pt)-based Joule heating elements- each smaller than 300 micrometer. We show that combining high-voltage multiplexed electronics and sequential addressing controlled by a high frequency clock, allows the independent operation of the 1024 microheater elements. We demonstrate the generation of heat images and the patterning of metallic structures formed from the liquid metal Gallium. Our work demonstrates new capabilities for on-chip thermal devices, and opens the possibility to realize novel heat-controlled microactuation systems.</p>

            <p>The effects of pressure on the crystal structure of scheelite-type perrhenates were studied using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and density-functional theory. At ambient conditions, the studied materials AgReO4, KReO4, and RbReO4, exhibit a tetragonal scheelite-type crystal structure described by space group I41/a. Under compression, a transition from scheelite-to-M${\prime}$-fergusonite (space group P21/c) was observed at 1.6 and 7.4 GPa for RbReO4 and KReO4, respectively. The transition involves a relative volume decrease. On the other hand, AgReO4 underwent a phase transition to the M-fergusonite structure (space group I2/a) at 13.6 GPa. In this case there is no appreciable volume discontinuity. The room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state for the three studied perrhenates was estimated using a second-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The results for the low-pressure phase are confirmed by density-functional theory calculations. The analysis of the bulk modulus shows that the compressibility of the compounds decreases following the sequence RbReO4 > KReO4 > AgReO4, which is related to the compressibility of the RbO8, KO8, and AgO8 bidisphenoid units. Density-functional theory also offers valuable insights into the elastic constants. Despite giving a good description for the low-pressure phase in the three compounds, density-functional theory cannot catch the structural phase transition observed in experiments. Reasons for it are discussed in the manuscript.</p>

The determination of the pressure dependence of unit-cell parameters and volume yields precise values for linear compressibility of each axis and the pressure-volume equation of state for both the zircon and scheelite phases. Additional information on the mechanical properties of ErVO4, obtained from density-functional theory calculations, is also reported.</p>

            <p>Strong correlation, in concert with symmetry and topology, engenders novel gapless phases of matter, though only a tip of the iceberg has been seen. An exemplary framework is provided by Weyl-Kondo semimetals, in which Weyl fermions develop through crystalline symmetry constraints on the emergent low-energy heavy-fermion excitations. This paradigm has opened up new opportunities to explore correlated topologies without a noninteracting counterpart, but fully realizing this potential requires a large base of candidate materials. Here we confront the challenge on both fronts by studying heavy fermion systems with hexagonal space groups. This family contains a large number of chiral nonsymmorphic crystal structures that promote Weyl degeneracies and, in addition, feature geometric frustration in the $f$-electron magnetism. Our calculations for the heavy fermion states identify Weyl-Kondo semimetals with chiral or achiral Weyl nodes in the respective structural classes. We also develop a new search strategy for the difficult case of strongly correlated materials, using a combination of materials database, symmetry classification and experiments, and propose as candidate topological heavy fermion systems the chiral CePt$_2$B and achiral Ce$_2$NiGe$_3$ and Ce$_6$Co$_{2-\delta}$Si$_3$.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gieberth Rodriguez-Lopez, Ezequiel E. Ferrero</p>
            <p>We investigate thermal avalanche dynamics in amorphous solids using elastoplastic models with local activation rules and no external driving. Dynamical heterogeneities, quantified through persistence measurements and the associated four-point susceptibility $\chi_4$, reveal the emergence of correlated spatiotemporal rearrangements as temperature is varied. As temperature increases, avalanche statistics evolve from scale-free behavior with exponential cutoffs to regimes dominated by system-spanning runaway events. We identify a system-size-dependent critical temperature $T_c(L)$ that separates intermittent avalanche dynamics from thermally assisted flow, where self-sustained avalanches transiently fluidize the system. We show that $T_c(L)$ decreases algebraically with increasing system size, suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit arbitrarily small but finite temperatures may destabilize the intermittent regime. The relation between avalanche size and duration resembles that in sheared systems, whereas the statistics of minimal distances to yielding reveal a temperature-driven reorganization of marginal stability absent in strictly driven overdamped dynamics. Our results demonstrate that thermal activation alone can generate a finite-size-controlled instability scale in disordered elastic media.</p>

            <p>The topological surface code is a leading candidate for harnessing long-range entanglement to protect logical quantum information against errors, and teleportation of logical states is desirable for robust quantum information processing. Nevertheless, scaling up the surface code in quantum teleportation poses a formidable challenge to experiment. Here on a superconducting quantum processor with 125 qubits, we demonstrate the robust teleportation of topological rotated surface code prepared by a linear-depth unitary circuit, with code distances up to 7. We obtain the teleportation phase diagram by tuning the local entangling gates uniformly across a finite threshold. Furthermore, we show that the entangling threshold can be boosted by coherent qubit rotations that inject magic resources beyond the Clifford regime, restoring the duality symmetry of the topological phase, which serves as a guiding principle to minimize the entanglement resource. Our results shed light on simulating and leveraging topological quantum matter on quantum devices, and pave the way to the ultimate goal of distributed fault tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Demonstrating genuine many-body quantum coherence in large-scale quantum processors remains a central challenge for near-term quantum technologies. Recent experiments on D-Wave quantum annealers have investigated quenches of Ising chains and observed defect densities that show Kibble-Zurek scaling, consistent with coherent quantum dynamics. However, identical scaling can arise from classical or thermal processes. Here we propose the use of many-body coherent oscillations (MBCO) as a diagnostic for the identification of system-wide coherence in analog quantum simulators. Solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, we show that quenches of a staggered one-dimensional Ising chain across a quantum critical point produce oscillatory signatures in defect observables. We implement this model on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer. Using fast-anneal protocols, we find that, although defect densities follow Kibble-Zurek scaling, the expected oscillatory behavior is absent. We demonstrate that static disorder associated with individual qubits is not likely responsible for the absence of MBCO. Modest modifications to annealing schedules can dramatically enhance oscillation visibility. This work gives a general roadmap for the search for quantum coherence in noisy, large-scale quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Efimov Effect in Ultracold Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shayamal Singh, Chris H. Greene</p>
            <p>A quantum-mechanical description is presented for the three-body physics of shielded dipolar molecules, including a prediction of observable Efimov physics. Despite the anisotropic and long-range nature of the interaction, shielding enables a regime in which universality emerges already at the two-body level and extends to the three-body sector, where Efimov physics emerges. On the negative side of the scattering-length resonance, computed trimer binding energies display the characteristic scaling expected for Efimov resonances. Finally, the sudden approximation can be used to create trimer bound states, starting from positive energy trap states as a way to create or detect these molecular trimers. Moreover, the three-body parameter expressed in dipolar units is found to be universal.</p>

            <h2>Topological phase dynamics described by overtone-synthesized classical and quantum Adler equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Motoki Asano</p>
            <p>The Adler equation is a well-known one-dimensional model describing phase locking and synchronization. Motivated by recent experiments using optomechanical oscillators, we extend the model to include overtone-synthesized sinusoidal coupling with adiabatic temporal modulation. This extension gives rise to unique topological features such as winding-number quantization, discontinuous phase-slip transitions, and hysteretic and non-reciprocal phase dynamics. We further extend the analysis to the quantum regime, where we find a counterintuitive result: the breakdown of winding-number quantization. This arises from the superposition of different winding-number states in a closed-space Thouless pump. Moreover, hysteretic dynamics, once eliminated in quantum adiabatic approximation, is recovered in non-adiabatic calculations, as the superposition of two Floquet states with different PT eigenvalues becomes the quantum counterpart of phase trajectory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Gang Kong, Shinichiro Akiyama, Tao Shi, Z. Y. Xie</p>
            <p>We investigate the phase structure of the single-flavor Gross--Neveu model with Wilson fermions using the Grassmann corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG). The path integral is formulated as a two-dimensional Grassmann tensor network and approximately contracted by the Grassmann CTMRG algorithm. We investigate the phase diagram by varying the fermion mass and the four-fermion coupling, using the pseudoscalar condensate as an order parameter for the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ parity symmetry breaking phase. The universality classes of the phase boundaries are identified through the central charge $c$ obtained via scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extract the quantity related to the entanglement spectrum from the converged CTMRG environments, allowing us to distinguish the topological insulator phase and the trivial phase. The resulting phase structure suggests that the Aoki phase is separated from the other phases by critical lines characterized by $c=1/2$, while the critical lines with $c=1$ separate the topological insulating and trivial phases. Our numerical results also indicate that the Aoki phase does not persist in the strong-coupling regime for the single-flavor theory.</p>

            <p>In this study, we developed a UV-tape-assisted laser patterning (UT-Laser) technique that enables the simple transfer-based formation of wiring with line widths below 200 $\mu$m onto textile substrates. With the rapid advancement of wearable devices capable of acquiring various types of physiological and environmental information, research on electronic textiles (e-textiles)-in which electronic components are integrated into fabrics and clothing-has progressed considerably. However, integrating high-performance, rigid electronic components onto textiles remains challenging: the diameter of textile fibers limits the formation of fine wiring, making reliable mounting of such components difficult. To address these challenges, we devised the UT-Laser technique, in which thin foil or film materials are laser vector-cut on UV tape, and the adhesive strength is controlled through UV exposure. The unnecessary portions are selectively and collectively peeled away to form fine wiring, which is subsequently transferred onto the textile substrate. This approach enables facile fabrication of fine wiring with line widths below 200 $\mu$m on textiles. Furthermore, by forming fine wiring from a flexible copper clad laminate and transferring it onto heat-resistant glass cloth, electronic components can be soldered directly, allowing the fabrication of e-textile devices capable of withstanding more than 10,000 bending cycles. The prototype e-textile device fabricated using the proposed method integrates a microcontroller, USB connector, battery holder, flash memory, inertial measurement unit, and environmental sensors, and successfully acquires data related to stair climbing, respiration, and changes in body temperature during sleep.</p>

            <h2>On some mathematical problems for open quantum systems with varying particle number</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benedikt M. Reible, Luigi Delle Site</p>
            <p>We derive the effective Hamiltonian $H - \mu N$ for open quantum systems with varying particle number from first principles within the framework of non-relativistic quantum statistical mechanics. We prove that under physically motivated assumptions regarding the size of the system and the range of the interaction, this form of the Hamiltonian is unique up to a constant. Our argument relies firstly on establishing a rigorous version of the surface-to-volume ratio approximation, which is routinely used in an empirical form in statistical mechanics, and secondly on showing that the Hilbert space for systems with varying particle number must be isomorphic to Fock space. Together, these findings provide a rigorous mathematical justification for the standard grand canonical formalism employed in statistical physics.</p>

            <p>While non-Hermitian Hamiltonians enable exotic dynamical phenomena, implementing their nonunitary time evolution on near-term quantum devices remains challenging. We propose a hardware-friendly protocol that simulates non-Hermitian dynamics without continuous monitoring. Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) evolution via classical Gaussian white-noise averaging and to subsequently cancel the quantum-jump contribution at the level of the measured observable using stochastic quantum error mitigation (QEM). The scheme requires no ancillas or controlled time-evolution, while the mitigation layer uses only single-qubit operations. We validate the method through numerical simulations of a model with asymmetric hopping, interaction, and disorder. Our work provides a programmable and ancilla-free framework investigating exotic dynamics that are not completely-positive and trace-preserving using QEM.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Rizzi, Sangwoo Kim</p>
            <p>Biological tissues are active materials whose non-equilibrium dynamics emerge from distinct cellular force-generating mechanisms. Using a two-dimensional active foam model, we compare the effects of traction forces and junctional tension fluctuations on confluent tissue dynamics. While these two modes of activity produce qualitatively different cell shapes, rearrangement statistics, and spatiotemporal correlations in fluid states, we find that the long-time cellular motion universally converges to persistent Brownian dynamics. This universal feature contrasts with the non-universal correlations between cell geometry, rearrangement rate, and fluidity, which depend sensitively on the underlying modes of active force. Our results demonstrate that persistent Brownian motion provides a minimal framework for describing tissue dynamics, while distinct active forces leave identifiable structural and dynamical signatures, thereby enabling inference of the dominant active force in fluid state tissues.</p>

            <h2>Quantum criticality in open quantum systems from the purification perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Guo, Shuo Yang</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems host mixed-state phases that go beyond the symmetry-protected topological and spontaneous symmetry-breaking paradigms established for closed, pure-state systems. Developing a unified and physically transparent classification of such phases remains a central challenge. In this work, we introduce a purification-based framework that systematically characterizes all mixed-state phases in one-dimensional systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. By introducing an ancillary $\kappa$ chain and employing decorated domain-wall constructions, we derive eight purified fixed-point Hamiltonians labeled by topological indices $(\mu_{\sigma\tau},\mu_{\tau\kappa},\mu_{\kappa\sigma}) \in \{\pm1\}^3$. Tracing out the ancilla recovers the full structure of mixed-state phases, including symmetric, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking, average symmetry-protected topological phases, and their nontrivial combinations. Interpolations between the eight fixed points naturally define a three-dimensional phase diagram with a cube geometry. The edges correspond to elementary transitions associated with single topological indices, while the faces host intermediate phases arising from competing domain-wall decorations. Along the edges, we identify a class of critical behavior that connects distinct strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking patterns associated with distinct strong subgroups, highlighting a mechanism unique to mixed-state settings. Large-scale tensor-network simulations reveal a rich phase structure, including pyramid-shaped symmetry-breaking regions and a fully symmetry-broken phase at the cube center. Overall, our purification approach provides a geometrically transparent and physically complete classification of mixed-state phases, unified with a single $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\kappa}$ model.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional Weyl materials provide a controlled setting for exploring Floquet dynamics in open quantum systems, including nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Motivated by the desire for a strongly-coupled description, we employ holography to analyze the formation and stability of a NESS in a Weyl semi-metal induced by an external circularly polarized electric field. A time-periodic steady-state solution is constructed and its stability is determined from the spectrum of out-of-equilibrium quasinormal modes (Floquet exponents). A stable region in the drive parameter space is identified; beyond a critical curve, the Floquet exponents enter the upper half of the complex plane, leading to a superharmonic response. At sufficiently strong driving, chaotic time evolution emerges in the fully nonlinear initial-boundary value problem. The anomaly-induced response of the NESS to an external magnetic field is also computed, and the resulting behavior is related to the previously proposed chiral pumping effect.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) interactions are essential for describing molecules and materials, from drug design and catalysis to battery applications. These omnipresent interactions must also be accurately included in machine-learned force fields. The many-body dispersion (MBD) method stands out as one of the most accurate and transferable approaches to capture vdW interactions, requiring only atomic $C_6$ coefficients and polarizabilities as input. We present MBD-ML, a pretrained message passing neural network that predicts these atomic properties directly from atomic structures. Through seamless integration with libMBD, our method enables the immediate calculation of MBD-inclusive total energies, forces, and stress tensors. By eliminating the need for intermediate electronic structure calculations, MBD-ML offers a practical and streamlined tool that simplifies the incorporation of state-of-the-art vdW interactions into any electronic structure code, as well as empirical and machine-learned force fields.</p>

            <p>Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) integrated with waveguide-coupled dielectric resonators are promising building blocks for compact on-chip light sources. However, deterministic placement of QDs with strong mode overlap at the desired location remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a simple and scalable strategy for integrating colloidal QDs with a waveguide-coupled Si3N4 micro-ring resonator platform and for controlling the radiative dynamics of both bright and dark excitons via Purcell enhancement. We use strongly quantum-confined CsPbBr3 QDs, which exhibit bright-exciton emission at room-temperature, while emission at cryogenic temperatures originates from both bright and dark excitons. The CsPbBr3 QDs are selectively retained on the Si3N4 micro-ring cavities through a spin-coating/rinsing process, enabling efficient overlap with whispering-gallery modes and routing of the emission through integrated waveguides. We confirm accelerated decay of emission from both bright and dark excitons for CsPbBr3 QDs coupled to the micro-ring cavities. These results demonstrate an effective route to integrate colloidal QDs with Si3N4 micro-ring cavities and to leverage cavity-enhanced emission in scalable integrated photonic devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate phase-dependent electronic and excitonic phenomena in monolayer Y2TeO2 MOenes in the 1T and 2H polymorphs using first-principles theory and an effective many-body framework. Phonon spectra and elastic stability criteria establish both phases as dynamically and mechanically stable. Quasiparticle band structures reveal direct gaps in the near-infrared to visible range, with gap values increasing systematically from semilocal to hybrid exchange treatments. Optical spectra computed using a tight-binding Bethe-Salpeter approach demonstrate pronounced excitonic resonances arising from reduced dimensionality and weak dielectric screening. The exciton binding energies reach 152 meV in the 1T phase and 126 meV in the 2H phase, reflecting enhanced quantum confinement in the structurally denser phase. Our results identify Y2TeO2monolayers as a rare class of stable, direct-gap MOenes with strong excitonic effects, providing a platform for exploring many-body physics in low-dimensional oxychalcogenide systems especially for photovoltaic applications.</p>

            <p>Circuit quantum acoustodynamics (cQAD) devices have a wide range of applications in quantum science, all of which depend crucially on the quantum coherence of the mechanical subsystem. In this context, high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators (HBARs) are particularly promising, since they have shown very high quality factors with negligible dephasing. However, the introduction of piezoelectric films, which are necessary for coupling to a superconducting circuit, can lead to additional loss channels, such as surface scattering and two-level systems (TLS). Here, we study the acoustic dissipation of HBAR resonators in cQAD systems and find that the defect density of the piezoelectric material and its interface with the bulk are limiting factors for the coherence. We measure acoustic modes with phonon lifetimes up to 400 $\mu$s and lifetime-limited coherence times approaching one millisecond in the quantum regime. When coupled to a superconducting qubit, this leads to a hybrid system with a large quantum coherence cooperativity of $C_{T_2}=1.1\times10^5$. These results represent a new milestone for the performance of cQAD devices and offer concrete paths forward for further improvements.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points, where two or more eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system coalesce, are now of interest across many fields of physics, from the perspective of open-system dynamics, sensing, nonreciprocal transport, and topological phase transitions. In this work, we investigate exceptional points in cavity optomechanics, a platform of interest to diverse communities working on gravitational-wave detection, macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum transduction, etc. Specifically, we clarify the role of quantum jumps in making a clear distinction between Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points in optomechanical systems. While the Liouvillian exceptional point arises from the unconditional Lindblad dynamics and is independent of the phonon-bath temperature, the Hamiltonian exceptional point emerges from the conditional no-jump evolution and acquires a thermal shift due to an enhanced conditional damping. Employing the thermofield formalism, we derive a unified spectral framework that interpolates between these regimes via an analytical hybrid-Liouvillian description. Remarkably, in the weak-quantum-jump regime, the exceptional point is perturbed only at the second order, highlighting the robustness of the Hamiltonian exceptional point under small hybrid perturbations. Our work reveals a continuous family of hybrid exceptional points, clarifies the operational and physical differences between the conditional and unconditional dissipative dynamics in optomechanical systems, and provides a probe for thermal baths.</p>

            <p>This article presents an entropy stability analysis of smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) to review the validity of particle discretization of entropy equations. First, we consider the simplest SDPD system: a simulation of incompressible flows using an explicit time integration scheme, assuming a quasi-static scenario with constant volume, constant number of particles, and infinitesimal time shift. Next, we derive a form of entropy from the discretized entropy equation of SDPD by integrating it with respect to time. We then examine the properties of a two-particle system for a constant temperature gradient. Interestingly, our theoretical analysis suggests that there exist eight different types of entropy stability conditions, which depend on the types of kernel functions. It is found that the Lucy kernel, poly6 kernel, and spiky kernel produce the same types of entropy stability conditions, whereas the spline kernel produces different types of entropy stability conditions. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of particle discretization.</p>

            <p>Excitons are vital in the photophysics of materials, especially in low-dimensional systems. The conceptual and quantitative understanding of excitonic effects in nonlinear optical (NLO) processes is more challenging compared to linear ones. Here, we present an ab initio approach to second-order NLO responses, incorporating excitonic effects, that employs an exciton-state coupling formalism and allows a detailed analysis of the role of individual excitonic states. Taking monolayer h-BN and MoS2 as two prototype 2D materials, we calculate their second harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility and shift current conductivity tensor. We find strong excitonic enhancement requires that the resonant excitons are not only optically bright themselves, but also be able to couple strongly to other bright excitons. Our results explain the occurrence of two strong peaks in the SHG of monolayer h-BN and why the A and B excitons of MoS2 unexpectedly exhibit minimal excitonic enhancement in both SHG and shift current generation.</p>

            <p>Quantum criticality within Dirac fermions harbors a plethora of exotic phenomena, attracting sustained attention in the past decades. Here, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class. Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. In particular, we identify a non-stationary initial slip evolution characterized by an unconventional negative critical exponent $\theta=-0.84(4)$, corroborating the significant impact of fermionic critical fluctuations. Furthermore, we generalize the nonequilibrium scaling theory to incorporate both fermionic and bosonic critical modes, capturing their distinct relaxation behaviors. Armed with the scaling theory, we establish a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high efficiency.</p>

In this study, we develop a machine learning potential (MLP) that accurately captures the atomic-scale dynamic growth process of bilayer MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ vdWHs under feasible growth conditions. Our simulations uncover a crucial metastable SMMS (M = Mo or W) intermediate structure that facilitates metal atom swap and alloying. Eliminating the alloying contamination requires preventing the embedding of bare metal atoms. The results also show that the SMMS structure exhibits favourable electronic properties and emerges as a low Schottky barrier contact electrode for MoS$_2$ field-effect transistors (FETs).</p>

The model consists of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and the thermal/spin diffusion equation, whose transport coefficients (the thermal/spin conductivity and the spin relaxation time) depend on the order parameter, interpolating between values in the superconducting and normal states. Numerical and analytical calculations indicate that the domain wall moves toward the higher-temperature/spin-density region, where the order parameter is suppressed. We also derive an analytical expression for the vortex velocity. We can understand the dynamics of topological defects as processes that reduce the loss of condensation energy. We also analyze the driving force, the viscous force, the thermal force, and the force due to the spin accumulation gradient, on the basis of the momentum balance relations.</p>

            <p>Moire superlattices formed in van der Waals heterostructures due to twisting, lattice mismatch and strain present an opportunity for creating novel metamaterials with unique properties not present in the individual layers themselves. Ferroelectricity for example, arises due to broken inversion symmetry in twisted and strained bilayers of 2D semiconductors with stacking domains of alternating out-of-plane polarization. However, understanding the individual contributions of twist and strain to the formation of topological polar nanostructures remains to be established and has proven to be experimentally challenging. Inversion symmetry breaking has been predicted to give rise to an in-plane component of polarization along the domain walls, leading to the formation of a network of topologically non-trivial merons (half-skyrmions) that are Bloch-type for twisted and Neel-type for strained systems. Here we utilise angle-resolved, high-resolution vector piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to spatially resolve polarization components and topological polar nanostructures in marginally twisted bilayer WSe2, and provide experimental proof for the existence of topologically non-trivial meron/antimeron structures. We observe both Bloch-type and Neel-type merons, allowing us to differentiate between moire superlattices formed due to twist or heterogeneous strain. This first demonstration of non-trivial real-space topology in a twisted van der Waals heterostructure opens pathways for exploring the connection between twist and topology in engineered nano-devices.</p>

            <p>Self-propulsion is a quintessential aspect of biological systems, which can induce nonequilibrium phenomena that have no counterparts in passive systems. Motivated by biophysical interest together with recent advances in experimental techniques, active matter has been a rapidly developing field in physics. Meanwhile, over the past few decades, topology has played a crucial role to understand certain robust properties appearing in condensed matter systems. For instance, the nontrivial topology of band structures leads to the notion of topological insulators, where one can find robust gapless edge modes protected by the bulk band topology. We here review recent progress in an interdisciplinary area of research at the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, we give brief introductions to active matter and band topology in Hermitian systems, and then explain how the notion of band topology can be extended to nonequilibrium (and thus non-Hermitian) systems including active matter. We review recent studies that have demonstrated the intimate connections between active matter and topological materials, where exotic topological phenomena that are unfeasible in passive systems have been found. A possible extension of the band topology to nonlinear systems is also briefly discussed. Active matter can thus provide an ideal playground to explore topological phenomena in qualitatively new realms beyond conservative linear systems.</p>

            <h2>Temperature-activated dislocation avalanches signaling brittle-to-ductile transition in BCC micropillars</h2>

            <p>We carry out strain-controlled in-situ compression experiments of micron-sized tungsten (W) micropillars in the temperature range 300-900 K, together with simulations of three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) at the same scale. Two distinct regimes are observed. At low temperatures, plastic deformation appears smooth, both temporally and spatially. Stress fluctuations are consistent with a Wiener stochastic process resulting from uncorrelated dislocation activity within the pillars. However, high-temperature stress fluctuations are highly correlated and exhibit features of self-organized criticality (SOC), with deformation located within well-defined slip bands. The high-temperature stress relaxation statistics are consistent with a thermally activated nucleation process from the surface. The nature of the transition between the two regimes is a manifestation of the brittle to ductile transition in BCC metals.</p>

            <h2>Disorder-induced spin-cluster magnetism in a doped kagome spin liquid candidate</h2>

            <p>The search for new quantum spin liquid materials relies on systems with strong frustration such as spins on an ideal kagome lattice. However, lattice imperfections can have substantial effects which are as yet not well understood. In recent work, the two-dimensional kagome system YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{(1-x)}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_y$] has emerged as a leading candidate hosting a Dirac spin liquid which appears to survive at least for x<0.4, associated with alternating-bond hexagon (ABH) disorder. Here in magnetic samples with x=0.58, y=0.1 we report unusual in-plane ferromagnetic canting (FM) of the in-plane antiferromagnet (AFM), with an unusually wide regime of short-ranged order, and propose theoretical models to explain this behavior. First, we show that Kitaev type exchanges naturally arise on the kagome lattice to second order in the known Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchanges, and that these interactions can produce the unusual in-plane FM canting from antichiral AFM. Second, we propose a phenomenological model of weakly-FM-canted spin clusters to describe the short-ranged regime and analyze quantum fluctuations in an ABH toy model to show how ABH disorder can stabilize this regime. The combination of experimental observation and theory suggests that kagome-Kitaev interactions and ABH disorder are necessary for describing the magnetic fluctuations in this family of materials, with potential implications for the proposed proximate spin liquid phase.</p>

            <h2>Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurement scheme for determining the quantum geometric tensor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shu-Hui Zhang, Jin Yang, Ding-Fu Shao, Jia-Ji Zhu, Wen-Long You, Wen Yang, Kai Chang</p>
            <p>The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) embodies the geometry of the eigenstates of a system's Hamiltonian, and its full characterization across diverse quantum systems is essential. However, it is challenging to characterize the QGT of solid-state systems. Here we present an electric scheme to measure the complete QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems by using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), in which the spin texture is extracted from geometric amplitudes of Friedel oscillations induced by the intentionally introduced magnetic impurity, and then the QGT is derived from the momentum differential of spin texture. As a canonical spin model, the surface states of a topological insulator offer a promising way to demonstrate the scheme. In a slab of topological insulator, the gapped surface states host complete QGT, i.e., nonvanishing quantum metric and Berry curvature as its symmetric real part and the antisymmetric imaginary part. Thus, a detailed derivation guides the use of the developed scheme to measure the QGT of gapped surface states, even with an external magnetic field. This study opens a new avenue to directly measure the complete QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems by using spin-polarized STM.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Miles, Francesco Zatelli, A. Mert Bozkurt, Michael Wimmer, Chun-Xiao Liu</p>
            <p>Exchanging the positions of two non-Abelian anyons transforms between many-body wavefunctions within a degenerate ground-state manifold. This behavior is fundamentally distinct from fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons. Recently, quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a promising platform for creating topological Kitaev chains that can host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. In this work, we propose a minimal braiding setup in a linear array of quantum dots consisting of two minimal Kitaev chains coupled through an ancillary, normal quantum dot. We focus on the physical effects that are peculiar to quantum dot devices, such as interdot Coulomb repulsion and residual single electron tunneling. We find that the errors caused by either of these effects can be efficiently mitigated by optimal control of the ancillary quantum dot that mediates the exchange of the non-Abelian anyons. Moreover, we propose experimentally accessible methods to find this optimal operating regime and predict signatures of a successful Majorana braiding experiment.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of damping in a turbulent atomic Bose-Einstein condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junghoon Lee, Jongmin Kim, Jongheum Jung, Yong-il Shin</p>
            <p>Turbulence enhances momentum transport in classical fluids, effectively increasing their viscosity. We investigate an analogous effect in a superfluid by measuring the damping of collective oscillations in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) containing stationary spin-superflow turbulence. Using continuous spin driving to maintain turbulence in a spin-1 $^{23}$Na BEC, we excite its quadrupole mode and measure the damping rate over a range of temperatures. The damping consistently exceeds the Landau-damping rate expected for an equilibrium, non-turbulent BEC. The enhancement likely originates from two complementary processes: direct energy transfer from the mode to turbulent condensate fluctuations and turbulence-induced modification of the thermal cloud that amplifies Landau damping. These results establish collective-mode damping as a sensitive probe of momentum transport in superfluid turbulence.</p>

At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 <= N <= 8, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from parton large-N mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U and the number of flavor N . We construct the critical theory for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid and calculate the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N . These results could be validated in synthetic systems such as moire superlattices and cold atom platforms.</p>

            <p>The tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a hallmark of quantum statistics. This bunching can enhance the rates of fundamental processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering when atoms scatter into already occupied states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of light scattering follows directly from the occupation of the atom's final momentum state. Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, strongly affect atom-light scattering. Changes in local atomic correlations suppress the bosonic enhancement under weak repulsive interactions and increase the scattering rate under attractive ones. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of magnitude faster than the collisional dynamics of the momentum-space populations. Its extreme sensitivity to correlation effects makes off-resonant light scattering a powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic gases.</p>

            <h2>Shuttling Majorana zero modes in disordered and noisy topological superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bill P. Truong, Kartiek Agarwal, T. Pereg-Barnea</p>
            <p>The braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) forms the fundamental building block for topological quantum computation. Braiding protocols which involve the physical exchange of MZMs are typically envisioned on a network of topological superconducting wires. An essential component of these protocols is the transport of MZMs, which can be performed by using electric gates to locally tune sections of the wire between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. In this work, we numerically simulate this transport by tuning a single section of a superconducting wire which contains either disorder (uncorrelated and correlated) or noise. We focus on the impact of these additional effects on the diabatic error, which describes unwanted transitions between the ground state and excited states. We show that the behavior of the average diabatic error is predominantly controlled by the statistics of the minimum bulk energy gap which is suppressed in the presence of disorder. The increase in diabatic error can be several orders of magnitude and is most deleterious when the disorder correlation length is a finite fraction of the transport distance and negligible when these lengths are far apart. In the presence of noise, the diabatic error is significantly enhanced due to optical transitions which depend on the minimum bulk energy gap as well as the frequency modes present in the noise. The results presented here serve to further characterize the diabatic error in disordered and noisy settings, which are important considerations in practical implementations of physical braiding schemes.</p>

            <h2>Light-induced Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs in unconventional magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Hao Fu, Sayan Mondal, Jun-Feng Liu, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities, and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena. We demonstrate that the interplay between unconventional magnetism and light gives rise to a non-trivial light-matter coupling which governs the emergence of Floquet spin-triplet states with and without superconductivity that are absent otherwise. We find that photon-assisted processes promote the formation of spin-triplet densities and spin-triplet Cooper pairs between different Floquet sidebands. More precisely, the Floquet sidebands offer an additional quantum number, the Floquet index, which considerably broadens the classification of superconducting correlations that lead to Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs as an entirely dynamical phenomenon due to the interplay between light and unconventional magnetism. Furthermore, we discuss how the number of photons is connected to the symmetry of Cooper pairs and also explore how the distinct light drives can be used to manipulate them and probe the angular symmetry of unconventional magnets. Our results therefore unveil the potential of unconventional magnets for realizing nontrivial light-induced superconducting states.</p>

            <p>We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of active matter using a two-dimensional active Brownian particles model. In these systems, self-propelled particles undergo motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), spontaneously segregating into dense and dilute phases. We find that in the high-density phase, local particle mobility exhibits transient caging, with diffusivity remaining unchanged despite variations in the global system density. As global density increases further, the system undergoes a transition to a solid-like state through an intermediate regime with pronounced dynamical arrest. Our findings identify a distinct high-density regime characterized by transient caging and dynamical slowing down in a monodisperse active system, shedding new light on the connection between MIPS and nonequilibrium arrest.</p>

            <p>Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. To investigate the underlying superfluid dynamics, we employ a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate described by a damped Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an imposed pinning potential that serves as a simplified analogue of a crust. Within this minimal framework, we examine the emergence and evolution of turbulent vortex motion following impulsive perturbations reminiscent of glitch-like forcing. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which can sustain turbulent fluctuations in such a system. By tuning the damping coefficient $\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. While idealized, these findings illustrate how quantum turbulence with multiple scaling regimes can arise in pinned, rotating superfluids, and they suggest possible qualitative connections to vortex-mediated dynamics in neutron stars and other astrophysical superfluid systems.</p>

            <p>Stereoisomers of C$_{13}$Cl$_2$ exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation on NaCl surfaces. We resolved the enantiomeric geometries of the singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped their helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90° in one circulation is consistent with a half-Möbius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-Möbius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.</p>

            <h2>Dual-space cluster-diagrammatic approach to nonlocal electronic correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Félix Fossati, Evgeny A. Stepanov</p>
            <p>In this work, we extend the dual triply irreducible local expansion (D-TRILEX) approach for correlated electronic systems by introducing a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the reliable Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem. We further compare this method with the more computationally demanding parquet dynamical vertex approximation and find that, our method yields substantially more accurate results at momenta associated with the Fermi surface. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose a computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.</p>

            <p>The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we introduce a multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, that combines ultrafast tunneling microscopy (USTM), ultrafast point-contact spectroscopy (UPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescale, all within a single instrument. Using this platform, we investigate the collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator (TaSe4)2I. Our UPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22 THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via parametric amplification, analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at proximate frequency. Our studies reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective excitations in quantum materials and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast phenomena.</p>

            <p>Magnetic order typically disrupts superconductivity, reducing the supercurrent. Here, we show that chiral antiferromagnetism, with non-relativistic spin-split bands and distinctive valley-locked spin texture, can instead significantly enhance Josephson supercurrents. This enhancement stems from the emergence of dominant equal-spin triplet pairing and strong fluctuations of singlet pairing in momentum space, both induced by chiral antiferromagnetism. We demonstrate these results in Josephson junctions composed of chiral antiferromagnetic metals and conventional superconductors on kagome lattices. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced Josephson supercurrent is stabilized in a $\pi$-junction state. These phenomena persist across a broad energy range and remain stable for different temperatures and junction lengths. Our results unveil a previously unexplored mechanism for enhancing supercurrent by strong magnetic order and provide crucial insights into the large Josephson currents observed in Mn$_3$Ge.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from both ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent research topic in condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts exhibiting odd-parity spin splittings are generally thought to be absent in collinear magnets. Here, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be induced from collinear antiferromagnets by symmetry engineering. Remarkably, using effective model analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices breaks a spin-preserving pseudo-time-reversal symmetry and induces both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov-fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $Z_2$ short-ranged Ansätze and analyze the phase diagram in the mean-field parameter space, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a semi-Dirac spin liquid that emerges at the level of projective symmetry group classification and mean-field band structure, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all symmetry-allowed mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Among these, we find four quasi-one-dimensional QSL phases, one dimer phase, and one Dirac QSL phase. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations and compare qualitative momentum-space features of these spectra with those obtained at the mean-field level. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for neutron-scattering studies.</p>

            <p>Silicon can be heavily doped with phosphorus in a single atomic layer (a $\delta$ layer), significantly altering the electronic structure of the conduction bands within the material. Recent progress has also made it possible to further dope silicon with acceptor-based $\delta$ layers using either boron or aluminum, making it feasible to create devices with interacting $\delta$ layers with opposite polarity. Using Density Functional Theory, we calculate the electronic structure of a phosphorus-based $\delta$ layer interacting with a boron or aluminum $\delta$ layer, varying the distances between the $\delta$ layers. At separations 1 nm and smaller, the dopant potentials overlap and largely cancel each other out, leading to an electronic structure closely mimicking intrinsic silicon. At separations greater than 1 nm, the two $\delta$ layers behave independently of one another, with an equivalent electronic structure to a p-n diode with an intrinsic layer taking the place of the depletion region. One mechanism for charge transfer between $\delta$ layers at larger distances could be tunneling, where we see a tunneling probability exceeding what would be seen for a standard silicon 1.1 eV triangular barrier, indicating that the interaction between delta layers may enhance tunneling compared to a traditional junction.</p>

To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.</p>

The process gradually transforms a thermal ensemble of a noninteracting system into that of an interacting system of interest over a finite operation time, with the temperature controlled by parameters associated with the entropy of the initial state. We analyze this process in both nonintegrable and integrable spin chains with translational invariance. For the nonintegrable case, numerical simulations combined with a thermodynamic argument indicate that the thermal properties of local observables are accurately reproduced with a single parameter, although the operation time increases exponentially with precision. In contrast, for the integrable transverse-field Ising model, we analytically show that an extensive number of parameters tied to local conserved quantities is generally necessary, and the performance is affected by the presence of a quantum phase transition. These results clarify the potential and limitations of the quasi-adiabatic thermal process for an ensemble preparation and highlight the role of integrability in determining its efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Phase Transitions in Mean-Field Ginzburg-Landau Models: Conjugate Fields and Fourier-Mode Scaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yelyzaveta Satynska, Daniel T. Robb</p>
            <p>Dynamic phase transitions of periodically forced mean-field ferromagnets are often described by a single order parameter and a scalar conjugate field. Building from previous work, we show that, at the critical period $P_c$ of the mean-field Ginzburg-Landau (MFGL) dynamics with energy $F(m)=am^2+bm^4-hm$, the correct conjugate field is the entire even-Fourier component part of the applied field. The correct order parameter is $z_k=\sqrt{\bigl|\,m_k^2-|m_{k,c}|^2\,\bigr|}$, where $m_k$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component of the magnetization m(t), and $m_{k,c}$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component at the critical period. Using high-accuracy limit-cycle integration and Fourier analysis, we first confirm that, for periodic fields that contain only odd components, the symmetry-broken branch below $P_c$ exhibits $z_k \propto \varepsilon^{1/2}$ (computationally tested for modes $k\le30$), where $\varepsilon=(P_c-P)/P_c$. This provides strong evidence that the 1/2 scaling holds for all Fourier modes. We then find three robust facts: (1) Exactly at $P_c$, adding a small perturbation composed of even Fourier components with an overall field multiplier $h_{mult}$ yields $z_k \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ across many $k$. (2) Mode-resolved deviations obey a parity rule: $|\delta m_{2n}| \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ and $|\delta m_{2n+1}| \propto h_{mult}^{2/3}$. (3) These scalings persist in two MFGL models with higher-order nonlinearities.</p>

            <h2>Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal NiTe$_2$</h2>

            <p>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide(TMD) NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, conflicting conclusions were reported regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study core-levels and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy(SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy(XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ Resonant-PES to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The Ni $3d$ on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states(DOS) and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge-transfer (CT) cluster model calculations using the experimental $U_{dd}$, and it shows that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative CT energy $\Delta$. A comparative analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated CT insulator character, with a larger $U_{dd}$ and positive $\Delta$. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$<$NiO, and shows that $T_{eg}$ is not responsible for reducing $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO. The negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$ leads to the increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron. However, importantly, since $U_{dd}$$>$$|\Delta|$, a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ results in pushing $d$-states away from Fermi level and this is required to make NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated Dirac semi-metal with band inversion in the $p$-$p$ type lowest energy excitations.</p>

            <p>The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) CoTe$_2$ is a topological Dirac Type-II metal. However, the Co $3d$-bands in CoTe$_2$ do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO. We address this conundrum by studying the electronic structure of CoTe$_2$ using hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Resonant-PES. We quantify the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band Resonant-PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV for CoTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level Co $2p$ PES and $L$-edge XAS spectra of CoTe\textsubscript{2} and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe\textsubscript{2}, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$<$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe\textsubscript{2} is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$>$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$$p$ type lowest energy excitations. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in the correlated metal CoTe$_2$.</p>

            <h2>General spin models from noncollinear spin density functional theory and spin-cluster expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomonori Tanaka, Yoshihiro Gohda</p>
            <p>We present a data-efficient framework for constructing general classical spin Hamiltonians by combining the spin-cluster expansion (SCE) with fully self-consistent noncollinear spin density functional theory (DFT). The key idea is to fit the SCE model to magnetic torques rather than to total energies. Because torques are site-resolved vectors, each spin configuration provides many informative regression targets, improving conditioning and substantially reducing the number of required DFT calculations, especially for large supercells. Applied to the B20-type chiral magnets ${\rm Mn}_{1-x}{\rm Fe}_{x}{\rm Ge}$ and ${\rm Fe}_{1-y}{\rm Co}_{y}{\rm Ge}$, the resulting SCE models determine full pairwise exchange tensors -- including isotropic exchange, symmetric anisotropic exchange, and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction -- and predict the helical spin period via a micromagnetic mapping. The composition trends and the divergence of the period at the chirality sign-change point are well reproduced, in agreement with experiment. Moreover, the systematic nature of SCE enables controlled assessment of interaction order: as the training spin configurations become more disordered, the lowest-order model loses torque accuracy, whereas including higher-order interactions restores predictive power. These advances enable near-DFT-accurate spin models for finite-temperature magnetism and complex spin textures at modest computational cost, providing an extensible route to quantitative first-principles parameterization and predictive materials design.

            <h2>Direct Observation of the Spillover of High Magnetic Field-induced SC3 Superconductivity Outside the Spin-Polarized State in UTe2</h2>

            <p>In our recent study of the high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$ [Phys. Rev. X 15, 021019 (2025)] we found indirect evidence that the SC3 superconducting phase spills out beyond the first-order phase boundary of the spin-polarized state. This prior study was limited to a maximal field strength of 41.5 T, and mapped the $b-ac$ rotation plane. Here we measure a high quality sample with residual resistivity ratio RRR = 605 under rotations in the $b-c$ plane up to 45 T. This extended field range helps to unambiguously demonstrate the spillover of SC3 outside the polarized paramagnetic state. This is identified by the observation of zero resistance at low temperatures, for magnetic field strengths lower than the metamagnetic transition field resolved at higher temperatures. This observation is consistent with the scenario that electronic pairing of the SC3 phase is mediated by quantum critical fluctuations.</p>

            <p>The frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function (g(2)({\tau})) of single-molecule fluorescence has recently been proposed as a powerful new quantum light spectroscopy that can reveal intrinsic quantum coherence in excitation energy transfer in molecular systems ranging from simple dimers to photosynthetic complexes. Yet, no experiments have been reported to date. Here, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence g(2)({\tau}) quantum light spectroscopy (SMFg2-QLS) that can simultaneously measure the fluorescence intensity, lifetime, spectra, and g(2)({\tau}) with frequency resolution, for a single molecule in a controlled environment at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature. As a proof of principle, we have studied single molecules of IDTBT (indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole), a semiconducting donor-acceptor conjugated copolymer with a chain-like structure that shows a high carrier mobility and annihilation-limited long-range exciton transport. We have observed different g(2)({\tau}=0) values with different bands or bandwidths of the single molecule IDTBT fluorescence. The general features are consistent with theoretical predictions and suggest non-trivial excited state quantum dynamics, possibly showing quantum coherence, although further analysis and confirmation will require additional theoretical calculations that take into account the complexity and inhomogeneity of individual IDTBT single molecular chains. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of frequency- and time-resolved SMFg2-QLS to provide new insights into molecular quantum dynamics and to reveal signatures of intrinsic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light harvesting that are independent of the nature of the light excitation.</p>

            <p>Domain wall motion underpins emerging spintronic technologies, such as high-speed racetrack devices and THz logic, and accelerating walls quickly is a key challenge on the path to faster devices. Recent experimental advances introduced magnetic materials with non-uniform composition, allowing angular momentum compensation points and fast domain wall motion, although acceleration of domain walls in these materials remains poorly understood. Here, we show that spatial variation of exchange and anisotropy not only pushes the wall towards lower wall surface tension region, but also modifies its inertial mass, giving rise to a variable-mass relativistic dynamics. We find another force, originating from the magnon velocity gradient, that dominates as the wall velocity approaches the magnon speed.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Andrei V. Eserkepov</p>
            <p>Although the two-dimensional model of random networks of metallic nanowires or carbon nanotubes is widely used, it significantly overestimates the number of contacts between elements compared to quasi-three-dimensional models. This, within the mean-field approximation, leads to overestimates of the electrical conductivity, especially when the main contribution to the system's electrical conductivity comes from the contact resistances between the conductors. In the two-dimensional model, the system's electrical conductivity depends quadratically on the conductor density, whereas in the three-dimensional model, this dependence is linear. We propose a simple modification of a two-dimensional model, which can capture the saturation effect of the number of contacts per conductor in a real nanowire network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Lefevere, Hal Tasaki</p>
            <p>The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version whose distribution of left--right crossings satisfies an exact recursion. In dimensions $d\geq 3$, we prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) on all length scales. A Gaussian closure, supported by numerics, predicts that the variance-to-mean ratio of the conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ for all $d\geq 2$ (the ``$2/3$ law''). We provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original (non-hierarchical) Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and conjecture that it is a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching. In the marginal case $d=2$, our hierarchical recursion reproduces the known scaling of the mean conductance and its variance.

            <p>Geometrical design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors, because the proper placement of intended defects in the current path contribute to flux pinning, a reduction in dissipation, and an increase in achievable current density. Topology optimization is currently one of the most powerful approaches used to determine consistent structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon Yee, Wilson Collins, Maximilian Rutkowski</p>
            <p>We extend the Prometheus framework for unsupervised phase transition discovery from 2D classical systems to 3D classical and quantum many-body systems, addressing scalability in higher dimensions and generalization to quantum fluctuations. For the 3D Ising model ($L \leq 32$), the framework detects the critical temperature within 0.01\% of literature values ($T_c/J = 4.511 \pm 0.005$) and extracts critical exponents with $\geq 70\%$ accuracy ($\beta = 0.328 \pm 0.015$, $\gamma = 1.24 \pm 0.06$, $\nu = 0.632 \pm 0.025$), correctly identifying the 3D Ising universality class via $\chi^2$ comparison ($p = 0.72$) without analytical guidance. For quantum systems, we developed quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architectures using complex-valued wavefunctions and fidelity-based loss. Applied to the transverse field Ising model, we achieve 2\% accuracy in quantum critical point detection ($h_c/J = 1.00 \pm 0.02$) and successfully discover ground state magnetization as the order parameter ($r = 0.97$). Notably, for the disordered transverse field Ising model, we detect exotic infinite-randomness criticality characterized by activated dynamical scaling $\ln \xi \sim |h - h_c|^{-\psi}$, extracting a tunneling exponent $\psi = 0.48 \pm 0.08$ consistent with theoretical predictions ($\psi = 0.5$). This demonstrates that unsupervised learning can identify qualitatively different types of critical behavior, not just locate critical points. Our systematic validation across classical thermal transitions ($T = 0$ to $T > 0$) and quantum phase transitions ($T = 0$, varying $h$) establishes that VAE-based discovery generalizes across fundamentally different physical domains, providing robust tools for exploring phase diagrams where analytical solutions are unavailable.</p>

            <p>Copolymerization is commonly employed to tune polymers' glass formation and improve properties such as ion conductivity and adhesion. Classically, mixing rules such as the Fox equation are employed to explain glass transition temperature (Tg) variations with copolymer composition. However, many copolymers deviate from these mixing rules in a manner that is monomer-sequence sensitive. We perform molecular dynamics simulations to probe the interplay between copolymer sequence, liquid-liquid phase equilibria, and Tg. We find that the direction and sequence-dependence of Tg shift are predicted by the liquid-liquid phase behavior of the comonomers. Systems tending towards Upper Critical Solution Temperature behavior negative Tg deviations, while systems tending towards Lower Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit positive Tg deviations. In both cases, this effect is strengthened with increasing alternation - a consequence of bond-induced forced mixing. These results inform strategies for rationally varying copolymer Tg, at fixed composition, via design of polymer chain sequence.</p>

Zhu et al.$^1$ reported that the ratio of the measured ZFC magnetic moment to the Meissner magnetic moment of the sample (and this ratio was termed the superconducting volume fraction$f$) reaches 81-86%.

Upon our request, Zhu et al.$^1$ provided detailed explanations and the equation they used to calculate$f$. To our knowledge, the procedure$^1$ and equation$^1$ for calculating $f$ have never been mentioned or described before, including in Ref.$^1$. Here we argue that the proposed equation$^1$ and procedure$^1$ are incorrect, and that this equation$^1$ results in multiple overestimations of the superconducting volume fraction in the sample. This overestimation error affects all superconducting volume fractions $f$ in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates reported to date$^{1-4}$. Therefore, we describe the error we discovered in this paper.</p>

            <p>Attention-based neural networks such as transformers have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing, genomics, and vision. Here, we demonstrate the use of transformers for quantum feedback control through both a supervised and reinforcement learning approach. In particular, due to the transformer's ability to capture long-range temporal correlations and training efficiency, we show that it can surpass some of the limitations of previous control approaches, e.g.~those based on recurrent neural networks trained using a similar approach or policy based reinforcement learning. We numerically show, for the example of state stabilization of a two-level system, that our bespoke transformer architecture can achieve near unit fidelity to a target state in a short time even in the presence of inefficient measurement and Hamiltonian perturbations that were not included in the training set as well as the control of non-Markovian systems. We also demonstrate that our transformer can perform energy minimization of non-integrable many-body quantum systems when trained for reinforcement learning tasks. Our approach can be used for quantum error correction, fast control of quantum states in the presence of colored noise, as well as real-time tuning, and characterization of quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Equilibrium quantum systems are often described by a gas of weakly-interacting normal modes. Bringing such systems far from equilibrium, however, can drastically enhance mode-to-mode interactions. Understanding the resulting liquid is a fundamental question for quantum statistical mechanics, and a practical question for engineering driven quantum devices. To tackle this question, we probe the nonequilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting nonequilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the non-local redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation -- an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium liquid of plasmons.</p>

            <p>Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</p>

            <h2>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. L. Dao</p>
            <p>In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ & $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in almost all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</p>

Inspired by probabilistic control of classical chaos, our protocol stochastically alternates between intrinsic instability and engineered control operations that steer trajectories toward a target point. Simulation of exact quantum dynamics and a semiclassical truncated Wigner approximation reveal universal properties of the cat map's control transition. To further characterize this universality, we introduce the inverted harmonic oscillator as an analytically tractable effective model of instability. By integrating numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck description, and a direct spectral analysis of the stochastic quantum channel, we identify quantum signatures absent in classical limits. The close agreement between quantum simulation, truncated Wigner approximation, and inverted oscillator analysis shows that universal features of the transition are set by uncertainty-limited quantum fluctuations and are insensitive to genuine quantum interference.</p>

            <h2>Mitigating the sign problem by quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kwai-Kong Ng, Min-Fong Yang</p>
            <p>The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng-Ju Lin, Hrant Gharibyan, Vincent P. Su</p>
            <p>We use Pauli Path simulation to variationally obtain parametrized circuits for preparing ground states of various quantum many-body Hamiltonians. These include the quantum Ising model in one dimension, in two dimensions on square and heavy-hex lattices, and the Kitaev honeycomb model, all at system sizes of one hundred qubits or more -- sizes at which generic quantum circuits are beyond the reach of exact state-vector simulation -- thereby reaching utility scale. We benchmark the Pauli Path simulation results against exact ground-state energies when available, and against density-matrix renormalization group calculations otherwise, finding strong agreement. To further assess the quality of the variational states, we evaluate the magnetization in the x and z directions for the quantum Ising models and compute the topological entanglement entropy for the Kitaev honeycomb model. Finally, we prepare approximate ground states of the Kitaev honeycomb model with 48 qubits, in both the gapped and gapless regimes, on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum computer using parametrized circuits obtained from Pauli Path simulation. We achieve a relative energy error of approximately $5\%$ without error mitigation and demonstrate the braiding of Abelian anyons on the quantum device beyond fixed-point models.</p>

            <h2>Quantum dynamics of large spins in static and rotating magnetic fields: Entanglement resonances and kinks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nargis Sultana, Siddharth Seetharaman, Rejish Nath</p>
            <p>We examine the quantum dynamics of both a single large spin and a pair of spins in the presence of static and rotating magnetic fields, which can be important for qudit-based quantum technologies. Notably, we find resonant, periodic oscillations between two maximally stretched states, irrespective of how large the spin is. Additionally, we observe periodic transitions between sublevels with magnetic quantum numbers of opposite signs. The dynamics also exhibit a periodic transfer of the spin to the maximally stretched state, starting from the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian. For a pair of spins, we derive various resonance conditions and further analyze the entanglement generated by dipole-dipole interactions. In the case of two spin-1/2 particles, the entanglement dynamics reveal resonances and kinks in the maximum entanglement, and their criteria can be obtained from the energy spectrum. Strikingly, we show that the kink can be exploited to engineer the entanglement dynamics. Finally, we briefly discuss the regime of weak dipolar interactions, which are relevant for dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Peng</p>
            <p>We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Benini, Eduardo García-Valdecasas, Stathis Vitouladitis</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, for 0- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy and asymmetry of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields. In particular, we find a closed-form expression for the Rényi asymmetries of a compact scalar field on spherical subregions in three and four spacetime dimensions, and for higher-form gauge fields in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>Although effective non-reciprocal interactions have been investigated in a variety of fields, their consequences have not been explored in hydrodynamical turbulence. We initiate such an exploration by introducing non-reciprocal binary-fluid tubulence and uncover its properties by developing a two-dimensional (2D) Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (NRCHNS) model. We show that, as we increase the strength of the non-reciprocal terms, this model displays a hitherto unanticipated type of turbulence, with an inverse cascade of energy and an energy spectrum $E(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$, reminiscent of the well-known inverse cascade in forced, 2D fluid turbulence, but distinct from it, in so far as it develops a non-reciprocal flux $\mathbf J$. We demonstrate how NRCHNS turbulence suppresses $J(t) = |\mathbf J|$, as the Reynolds number increases. We compare and contrast 2D NRCHNS turbulence with its fluid-turbulence counterpart by examining spectra, fluxes, spectral balances, flow topologies, and signatures of multifractality.</p>

            <h2>Ergotropic Mpemba crossings in finite-dimensional quantum batteries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Triyas Sapui, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>The quantum Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a state initially farther from equilibrium relaxes more rapidly than one that starts nearer to equilibrium. In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.</p>

            <p>We consider the quantum Zeno dynamics arising from monitoring a time-dependent projector. Starting from a stroboscopic measurement protocol, it is shown that the effective Hamiltonian for Zeno dynamics involves a nonadiabatic geometric connection that takes the form of the Kato-Avron Hamiltonian for parallel transport, stirring the evolution within the time-dependent Zeno subspace. The latter reduces to counterdiabatic driving when projective measurements are performed in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis of the quantum system. The effective Zeno Hamiltonian can also be derived in the context of continuous quantum measurements of a time-dependent observable and the non-Hermitian evolution with a complex absorbing potential varying in time. Our results thus provide a unified framework for realizing shortcuts to adiabaticity via adaptive quantum Zeno measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiajie Cheng, Jaewon Kim, Oriana K. Diessel, Chong Zu, Shubhayu Chatterjee</p>
            <p>An applied magnetic field affects a superconductor in two ways -- by promoting pairing fluctuations, and by inducing topological defects called vortices that carry quantized magnetic flux. A quantitative characterization of the resultant field-induced superconducting dynamics with spatio-temporal resolution remains challenging, particularly in two-dimensional materials. In this work, we analyze magnetic noise measured by the depolarization rate of a proximate single spin-qubit as a non-invasive probe of such dynamical fluctuations. We demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the magnetic noise spectrum near $T_c$ deviates from predictions based on quasiparticle excitations due to critical superconducting fluctuations, which in turn are enhanced by a weak applied field. By analyzing the magnetic noise due to vortex dynamics, we further show that noise spectroscopy is not only able to distinguish between different vortex phases, but also extract key physical quantities of interest, such as oscillation frequencies of pinned vortices, phonon dispersion of vortex lattices and vortex diffusivity in a vortex liquid. Complementing recent work on noise magnetometry of quasiparticle excitations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in two-dimensional superconductors without an applied field, our work highlights the ability of noise spectroscopy to reveal a wealth of superconducting dynamical phenomena in an applied field.</p>

            <p>An atomic Josephson junction realized with dipolar bosons in a double-well potential can be described by an extended Bose-Hubbard model in which dipolar interactions generate an effective on-site interaction and nearest-neighbor pair tunneling. Using mean-field theory and exact diagonalization, we investigate how this correlated process affects zero-temperature equilibrium and dynamical properties of the system. In equilibrium, we show that pair tunneling induces ground-state parity modulations and significantly reshapes the phase diagram, producing qualitative changes in the quantum phase transitions toward NOON and phase-NOON states, as well as quantitative shifts of the critical points. Out of equilibrium, we demonstrate that it modifies the conditions for macroscopic quantum self-trapping, and assess its impact by comparing mean-field and fully quantum evolution, including the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions.</p>

            <p>We systematically investigate the nonlinear photogalvanic effect in few-layer graphene with various stacking orders, including AA- and AB-stacked bilayers, and AAA-, ABA-, and ABC-stacked trilayers. Using a tight-binding model to describe the electronic states, the shift current conductivity and jerk current conductivity are calculated over a broad spectral range from terahertz to visible frequencies. Our symmetry analysis reveals that a nonvanishing shift current emerges only in ABA-stacked trilayer graphene due to its broken inversion symmetry, with a peak conductivity reaching approximately $1.21 \times 10^{-13}$ A$\cdot$m/V$^2$ at optimal doping. In contrast, the jerk current, permitted in all structures, requires an in-plane static electric field and exhibits pronounced spectral tunability with chemical potential. These findings establish a comprehensive symmetry-band-field coupling paradigm for nonlinear photocurrents in layered graphene and provide design principles for tunable, polarization-sensitive photodetection and energy-harvesting devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the recent proposal of two-step transduction from microwave to optical domain using magnetic and elastic intermediate stages arXiv:2205.05088, we consider the coupling between resonant magnetic and elastic modes within a simple axially-symmetric nanodevice designed to host high-quality-factor acoustic modes: A suspended YIG ring structure supported by a central stem, fabricated from a continuous single-crystal film. We study the modes of the system with our custom finite element solvers. We identify the lowest order ``breathing'' mode of a magnetic vortex and the lowest order elastic breathing mode as having the largest mode overlap. For this pair of modes, the external out-of-plane magnetic bias field is critical for bringing them into resonance; however, we show that at the same time it also affects the strength of the coupling. To counteract this, we optimize the radius of the ring at fixed thickness. For the 100 nm-thick film the resonant coupling is maximized at $g/2\pi = 8\text{MHz}$ at $R\approx1.7\mu\text{m}$, indicating that the overlap integral approaches the idealized limit assumed in previous order-of-magnitude estimates.

            <p>Magnetic skyrmion bags, as high-order topological swirling spin textures, offer rich fundamental physics and distinct advantages for spintronic applications; however, their realization remains a formidable challenge, especially in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, through model analysis, we propose a novel design principle for engineering skyrmion bags with tunable topology in symmetry-broken 2D ferromagnetic lattices. The physics correlates to the delicate interplay of isotropic exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and magnetic anisotropy, which can stabilize a rich variety of high-order topological spin states as well as the intriguing skyrmionium with zero topological charge. We further validate this mechanism in monolayer CrInTe2 using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin model simulations, revealing the existence of field-free skyrmion bags. Furthermore, we find that a weak magnetic field triggers a transition to skyrmioniums that exhibit remarkable thermal stability up to 240 K.

            <p>We theoretically investigate spin dependent transport in altermagnet/triplet superconductor/altermagnet (AM/TSC/AM) junctions in the presence of interfacial Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC). Within a microscopic Bogoliubov de Gennes scattering formalism, we compute angle and energy resolved conductance, spin polarization, zero bias response, and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) for nodal $p_x$ and chiral $p_x+ip_y$ superconductors. Although altermagnets carry no net magnetization, the momentum dependent spin splitting, combined with RSOC, enables a pronounced spin valve effect without ferromagnetic electrodes. We show that conductance, spin polarization, and TMR exhibit distinct and robust fingerprints of the triplet pairing symmetry. For nodal $p_x$ superconductor, sign change induced surface Andreev bound states dominate subgap transport, producing strongly anisotropic conductance, giant zero bias spin polarization, and a monotonic enhancement of TMR with increasing RSOC. In contrast, the chiral $p_x+ip_y$ state exhibits smoother conductance and polarization profiles governed by topological edge modes, resulting in broader, lobe like TMR patterns with weaker sensitivity to interface transparency. Moreover, RSOC can acts as an electrically tunable spin-mixing knob, while the barrier strength controls coherence and energy selectivity, together enabling large, symmetry controlled spin filtering and magnetoresistance. Our results establish AM/TSC/AM junctions as a symmetry sensitive transport platform for realizing electrically tunable spin valve functionality and probing triplet pairing without ferromagnetic components.</p>

            <p>Magnetic impurities in real materials can mask the intrinsic spin-dependent properties of hosts. They interact indirectly through the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism, which limits the use of isolated impurity spins in applications such as qubits and spintronics. Suppressing the RKKY interaction would therefore enable access to the host's unperturbed behavior while simultaneously isolating impurity spins for functional use. Although single-color laser driving can suppress the RKKY interaction, it typically requires strong fields that may be impractical or destabilizing. To overcome these limitations, we show that two-color laser driving provides efficient and tunable control over all components of the RKKY interaction using two weak laser fields. Focusing on two-dimensional Rashba altermagnets, we show that interference between one- and two-photon processes produces altermagnet-specific Floquet corrections. These include additional AC Stark shifts, magnetizations, spin-orbit renormalization, and emergent in-plane Zeeman fields that are absent under single-color driving and in non-altermagnetic systems. Notably, two-color driving induces a finite $z$-component of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, stabilizing in-plane chiral magnetism and related textures in Rashba altermagnets. These effects enable tunable, near-complete on-off switching of the Heisenberg, Ising, and DM interactions through a Lifshitz-like modulation of the Fermi surface. We also show that the tuning process is highly sensitive to the chirality of both beams. We further map phase diagrams for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic impurity alignment with clockwise and counterclockwise canting as functions of Rashba coupling and altermagnetic order. Finally, we discuss candidate material platforms and experimental feasibility.</p>

            <p>Phenomena concerning altermagnets have opened up a window for unconventional analysis of the momentum space spin polarization (MSSP) of antiferromagnetic materials. Taking the example of one of the widely investigated altermagnets, CrSb, we explore the underlying mechanisms leading to the formation or breaking of altermagnetism. With the aid of DFT calculation and symmetry analysis, we study the behavior of MSSP in the altermagnetic bands of pristine CrSb, along with a few model structures designed from the pristine one by hypothetical vacancy engineering and interstitial doping. We show that the six-fold rotational symmetry of the pristine CrSb can be reduced to a two-fold rotational symmetry via vacancy and doping engineering. We discover the formation of fragmented nodal curves (FNCs) across the Brillouin zone when in an altermagnetic material when the symmetry is restricted to two-fold rotation. Unlike the typical nodal planes and axes, the location of the FNCs in the momentum space is found to be band-specific. The formation of FNCs is further validated by introducing uniaxial strain to CrSb and by examining the band structure of RbMnPO$_4$, as they both exhibit a two-fold rotational symmetry responsible for altermagnetism. We observe that, unlike the pristine case, these FNCs have the potential to manifest anomalous Hall conductivities (AHC), while the Néel vector orients along both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. This flexibility of the AHC will pave the way for the application of altermagnets in the futuristic quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Efficient transmission of elastic waves across interfaces is central to several applications, including medical imaging, seismic isolation, and transducer design. Interfaces with abrupt changes in the material properties significantly impede wave transmission, leading to reflections. This limitation, known as impedance mismatch, becomes even more prominent for mode conversion between different wave types due to polarization mismatch. In this study, we investigate a mechanism employing two-dimensional functionally graded anisotropic metamaterials to facilitate longitudinal--shear mode conversion as waves propagate from a stiff to a compliant medium. By embedding density and anisotropic shape gradients within the functionally graded metamaterial, polarization-induced impedance mismatch is mitigated and efficient mode conversion is enabled. We use unit cell dispersion analysis to tailor the frequency range for mode conversion through gradation in the dispersion behavior and coupling between modes. Using frequency-domain finite element analysis, we demonstrate broadband mode conversion across interfaces with large stiffness contrast operating in the 1--10 kHz range. We then experimentally validate and quantify mode conversion through full-field velocity measurements on an additively manufactured specimen. We further apply the methodology to design a device capable of converting radial--tangential wave modes.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Lattice Disorder and Collective Dipole Coupling Give Rise to Dicke Physics in Perovskite Quantum Dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priya Nagpal, Patanjali Kambhampati</p>
            <p>Halide perovskite quantum dots exhibit cooperative optical phenomena that are absent in conventional semiconductor nanocrystals, including exciton superradiance, superabsorption, and biexciton superradiance within individual dots. Here we develop a microscopic theory that identifies the physical origin of these Dicke effects and establishes how they can be controlled by materials parameters. The central result is that cooperative emission emerges from a competition between collective coupling of optical transition dipoles and lattice-induced disorder, with the balance governed by the Raman-derived phonon spectral density and the excitonic oscillator strength. At elevated temperature, strong Fröhlich coupling and glassy lattice dynamics produce dynamic disorder that suppresses dipole synchronization and yields incoherent emission. Upon cooling, lattice fluctuations freeze and cooperative coherence emerges when the collective coupling exceeds residual static disorder, defining size- and composition-dependent crossover temperatures that we map as phase diagrams. Extending the framework to biexcitons, we show that a confined biexciton constitutes a single correlated charge distribution dressed by a shared lattice configuration, enabling pathway-indistinguishable decay and cooperative radiative enhancement. The theory quantitatively accounts for observed size, composition, and temperature trends in radiative-rate constant ratios and biexciton binding energies, while explaining why full Dicke saturation is not universal. More broadly, the results establish Raman spectral weight and oscillator strength as design parameters for engineering cooperative quantum-optical behavior in quantum materials.</p>

By combining full counting statistics with newly developed non-Markovian master equation approaches, we introduce an effective master equation whose solution can be used to generate arbitrary moments of the heat statistics for any number of reservoirs. This theory applies equally to fermionic and bosonic systems, holds at arbitrarily strong coupling, and resolves out-of-equilibrium transient dynamics determined by the system's initial state. In the steady-state, weak-coupling limit, we recover results analogous to those of the well-known Landauer-Büttiker formalism. We conclude our discussion by demonstrating an application of the method to a prototypical fermionic system. Our results uncover a regime of transient negative heat conductance contingent upon the initial system preparation, providing a clear signature of non-trivial out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</p>

Within the hydrostatic pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in effective on-site repulsion in the maximally localised Wannier functions comprising the Ni $e_g$ bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase to an interplay between orbital localisation and competing screening channels arising from structural variations. Our results indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations, which show a close correspondence with the critical temperature. Including finite temperatures up to 100 K, $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics simulations then provide new insights into the debated structural phase diagram and further clarify the origin of the right-triangular superconducting dome. Finally, we study Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to confirm the crucial role of the $A$-site cation in shaping the pressure-driven evolution of electronic correlations.</p>

            <h2>Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kexin Feng, Chuang Chen, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</p>

            <h2>Profiling THz Beams With Off-Label Use of Infrared Microbolometric Cameras</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Nagamine, Carlo Vicario, Tariq Leinen, Guy Matmon, Adrian L. Cavalieri, Flavio Giorgianni</p>
            <p>Visualizing the spatial profile of light beams is essential for evaluating irradiance, characterizing beam quality, and achieving precise alignment. In the optical spectral range, this is readily performed using silicon-based CCD and CMOS cameras. In the terahertz (THz) range, however, it typically requires specialized detectors with prohibitive costs. Here, we show that an infrared (IR) camera can be used outside of its labeled specifications to achieve similar performance as a dedicated microbolometric THz camera, at under 1% of the THz camera's cost. We compared the cameras by characterizing THz beam profiles from two sources: a pulsed broadband THz beam produced through optical rectification in organic crystals, and a narrowband quasi-continuous-wave (quasi-CW) THz beam emitted by a quantum cascade laser. For the broadband THz radiation, the beam width measured by the two cameras differed by only ~ 6%, well within the pixel resolution limit, and in the narrowband quasi-CW case by just ~ 1.3%. Additionally, both cameras show linear responsivity over a comparable irradiance range. These results expand the applicability of conventional IR cameras to the THz range, suggesting that they will become routine tools for high-fidelity THz beam diagnostics and imaging in scientific and industrial applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Podhorský, Maximilian Klonz, Lux Böhmer, Sebastian Kulig, Chirag C. Palekar, Petr Klenovský, Sven Rodt, Stephan Reitzenstein</p>
            <p>We report on the monolithic, two-step epitaxial growth of site-controlled InGaAs quantum dots via the buried stressor method with local quantum dot density variation. As a result of high fabrication accuracy, we achieve low lateral displacements of the individual buried stressor apertures of $ 17^{+19}_{-17}$~nm from mesa centers. We provide extensive micro-photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence characterization of the site-controlled quantum dots and give theoretical calculations, explaining the effect of the stressor aperture on the quantum dot emission properties, positioning, and density. We show reproducibility of the nucleation process for apertures of the same size and achieve precisely-positioned, low- and high-density quantum dot nucleation within one active layer growth step. The results presented in this work demonstrate the significant potential of the buried stressor concept in fabricating single photonic chips, simultaneously combining single-photon sources and microlasers featuring different local densities of site-controlled quantum dots, paving the way for highly functional source modules with applications in photonic quantum technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fakher Assaad, Johanna Erdmenger, Anika Götz, René Meyer, Martin Rackl, Yanick Thurn</p>
            <p>An important problem in many-body physics is to reconstruct the spectral density from the imaginary-time domain Green's function. Typically, the imaginary-time Green's function is generated by Monte Carlo methods. As the one-point fermionic kernel diverges exponentially for large frequencies, numerical noise generically causes instabilities. We use a convolutional neural network to obtain the spectral density for a given imaginary time Green's function. The network is trained by data which we generate using random Gaussians. We improve the training data set available by including collision centers for the Gaussians rather than employing uniformly distributed Gaussians. Our network is constructed in such a way that its output fulfills positive semidefiniteness. We compare the results of our network with results of the Maximum Entropy method (MaxEnt), a standard method for the same reconstruction problem for the spectral density. This comparison is performed for three different cases, namely our Gaussian based test data as well as two physical models, the 1d Hubbard model showing spin-charge separation, and the two-dimensional SSH model in the self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the network outperforms MaxEnt when presented data close to the training set. For the physical models considered, MaxEnt recognizes physical features more precisely as compared to our network prediction. While it is hard to improve MaxEnt, the quality of the network depends on the training data set which can be systematically enhanced and improved.</p>

Invoking novel theorems about the Hopfion or $\mathbb{C}P^1$-model understood as flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy, we demonstrate a robust prediction for possibly nonabelian anyonic states induced by superconducting islands.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Motohiko Ezawa</p>
            <p>A prominent feature of $d$-wave altermagnets is that spin current is generated by applying temperature gradient, which is known as the spin-Nernst effect. We show in $f$-wave magnets that spin current is generated proportional to the square of the temperature gradient, which we call the nonlinear spin-Seebeck current. It can be used as a spin current diode. In addition, we show in $g$-wave altermagnets that spin current is generated in the third order of the temperature gradient. We also show in $i$-wave altermagnets that spin current is generated perpendicular to the temperature gradient, which is the spin-Nernst current. We have derived analytic formulas for these spin currents. It is interesting that these phenomena occur in the absence of the spin-orbit interaction. On the other hand, we show in $p$-wave magnets that spin current is not generated by temperature gradient.</p>

            <h2>Giant Out-of-Plane Magnetic Orbital Torque of Altermagnets from Spin-Group Symmetry Breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xukun Feng, Lay Kee Ang, Shengyuan A. Yang, Cong Xiao, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>To search for nontrivial spintronic characters of altermagnets has been a focus in spintronics, with numerous attentions paid to spin-group symmetry dictated non-relativistic effects, such as the spin-splitting torque (SST). Here, we go beyond this paradigm by unveiling the magnetic orbital torque (MOT) that is enabled only by spin-group symmetry breaking of real altermagnets with spin-orbit coupling. This effect enables generating unconventional out-of-plane orbital current with collinear orbital polarization from all 10 spin Laue groups of centrosymmetric altermagnets, which is critical for field-free manipulation of perpendicular magnetization that is a key for next-generation information technology. We reveal perturbative and non-perturbative effects of spin-group symmetry breaking, and unveil that MOT is a much more generic effect of real altermagnets than SST. Our first-principles calculations predict giant out-of-plane MOTs at room temperature in the absence of and competing with SST in experimentally identified altermagnets CrSb and FeSb2, respectively. These findings uncover new fundamental physics in altermagnetic spintronics, and open up broad vistas of altermagnets in magnetic memory.</p>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in square-planar nickelates has offered a rich materials platform to explore the origins of cuprate-like superconductivity. Experimental investigations however have largely been limited to the infinite-layer $R$NiO$_2$ ($R$=rare-earth) nickelates. Here, we construct a phase diagram of multi-layer square-planar Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$ compounds and discover signatures of superconductivity for $n$ = 4 - 8. Upon decreasing the dimensionality $n$, the superconducting anisotropy evolves due to 4$f$ electron effects, and electronic structure characteristics approach cuprate-like behavior. Magnetic fluctuations persist from within the superconducting regime and into the over-doped, non-superconducting regime. Remarkably, the superconducting regime overlaps with that of chemically-doped infinite-layer nickelates, demonstrating underlying commonalities and distinct differences across varying structural realizations of square-planar nickelates. Our work establishes this layered template for creating new nickel-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics and Pinning for Skyrmions in Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. C. Bellizotti Souza, C. J. O. Reichhardt, A. Saxena, C. Reichhardt</p>
            <p>We examine the dynamics, Hall angle, and pinning for N{é}el skyrmions in an altermagnet. Using an atomistic model, we show that skyrmion velocity and Hall angle dependence is anisotropic with respect to the direction of the drive, due to the fourfold symmetry implied by the two sublattices of the altermagnet. The skyrmion Hall angle and velocity at fixed drive show strong variations for increasing ratios of the exchange constant of the sublattices, $J_2/J_1$. This fourfold anisotropy of altermagnetic (ATM) skyrmions also leads to anisotropic pinning effects for an ATM skyrmion interacting with isotropic circular pinning sites. We also propose a simple particle model for this system that takes into account this anisotropy and find that it captures both the variations of the ATM skyrmion Hall angle and velocity as a function of drive direction, as also found in the atomistic simulations. Using this particle model, we examine ATM skyrmions interacting with a periodic array of pinning sites. For increasing ratios of $J_2/J_1$, we find a strongly non-monotonic ATM skyrmion velocity, where there is a minimum in the velocity where the skyrmion locks to different symmetry directions of the periodic pinning lattice. For a random array, we find that ATM skyrmions show strongly anisotropic depinning thresholds and velocity responses for different drive directions, and that the Hall angle is nearly constant with drive. In comparison, for the same parameters, the depinning threshold for a ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion is lower, and the skyrmion Hall angle shows a strong velocity dependence. The lower depinning threshold for FM skyrmions is due to stronger Magnus forces.</p>

            <p>Lasers serve as the fundamental workhorses of photonic quantum technologies, with perfectly coherent light fields being essential for many protocols that generate nonclassical light, implement coherent control schemes, and initialize qubits. However, no laser is absolutely ideal and the implications of deviations from perfect coherence in quantum technological tasks remain unclear. In this study, we theoretically and experimentally explore the quantum coherence properties of lasers from a resource theory perspective, establishing a significant connection between photonics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. We demonstrate that the maximum achievable quantum coherence for laser light is constrained by spontaneous emission and the purity of the dephased laser field state. As a critical example application in quantum information protocols, we show that the quantum coherence of a laser field with a given mean photon number directly governs the maximum purity attainable when initializing a qubit in a superposition state through resonant driving. Our findings are highly relevant for bridging applied physics and engineering with integrated photonic quantum technologies and resource theories, paving the way for reliable benchmarking of various coherent light sources for applications in photonics and quantum protocols.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic Geometry of Classical and Quantum Statistics in the Relativistic Regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hosein Mohammadzadeh, Zahra Ebadi, Omid Yahyayi Monem, Mohammad Hossein Naghizadeh Ardabili</p>
            <p>We investigate the thermodynamic geometry of classical and quantum ideal gases in the relativistic regime, with particular emphasis on the effects of particle mass and spatial dimensionality. Relativistic kinematics is incorporated through the full energy-momentum dispersion relation and the corresponding relativistic density of states. Using the Fisher-Rao information metric derived from the partition function, we analyze the thermodynamic curvature for Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Exact analytical expressions are obtained in two spatial dimensions, while the three-dimensional case is studied numerically. We show that the thermodynamic curvature preserves its characteristic sign-positive for bosons and negative for fermions; even in the relativistic regime, reflecting effective attractive and repulsive statistical interactions, respectively. A distinctive relativistic effect is the shift of curvature singularities from the non-relativistic critical point to a mass-dependent threshold at $\mu=mc^{2}$. In addition, the relativistic Bose-Einstein condensation temperature is evaluated, revealing explicit mass-dependent corrections to the non-relativistic result. These findings provide a unified geometric perspective on relativistic statistical systems and clarify the interplay between quantum statistics, relativistic kinematics, and critical behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nico Leumer, Harald Schmid, Milena Grifoni, Magdalena Marganska</p>
            <p>We study finite system properties of the canonical low energy model for a semiconducting nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The case of an isolated wire as well as of one proximitized by an s-wave superconductor are considered. Already for the normal wire, the presence of spin-orbit coupling leads to eigenstates of the finite system composed of more than two momentum eigenstates. The quantization condition for the wavevectors is not that of a quantum box, but given instead by a transcendental equation linking the involved wavevectors. For the wire with superconducting pairing, the presence of electron and hole channels complicates the composition of the eigenstates. In this case we derive an approximate quantization condition close to the phase boundary, and a condition for the appearance of exact zero energy states. It can be satisfied both in the topological and in the trivial phase. Both the trivial and topological zero energy states contribute to the linear transport through Andreev reflection and direct transmission processes, with their relative importance depending on the degree of the states' localization at the boundary.</p>

            <p>The aggregation of amyloid-forming peptides is a dynamic, complex process that underlies their diverse biological activities, from physiological functions to disease-associated dysfunctions. While the structure of fibrillar end-products is well-characterized for most amyloids, the heterogeneous and often transient oligomers, likely key in cytotoxicity, remain poorly investigated, especially for peptides with low-yield aromatic residues. Here, by exploiting and developing flow induced dispersion analysis in both peak and front modes, we demonstrate that intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence can be harnessed to quantify the conversion of diffusing monomers into non-diffusing oligomers and fibrils. We further characterize low-molecular-weight oligomers, and their size evolution from 2 to 10 nm over time. Importantly, we validate the robustness of our approach using two tryptophan-free and fast-fibrillating amyloid peptides, PSM$\alpha$3 and hIAPP, known for their key roles in S. aureus virulence and type 2 diabetes respectively. Our results overcome the limitations of traditional biochemical and biophysical amyloid assays by extending analysis from large oligomers and fibrils to small heterogeneous oligomers, under near-physiological conditions. This study thus offers a new analytical framework, thereby filling a critical gap in amyloid research, to probe the early stages of aggregation, key in the design of alternative therapeutics for amyloid-diseases.</p>

Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the interface configurations between beta-Ga2O3 (100) and both Si- and C-terminated 3C-SiC (001) substrates, considering realistic oxidation states that form at the SiC surface prior to epitaxial growth. Our analysis evaluates different stacking sequences and atomic-scale bonding arrangements, computing adhesion energies for various interface geometries to determine their relative thermodynamic stability. This work addresses the critical need for understanding beta-Ga2O3 integration on substrates with superior thermal conductivity, providing a theoretical framework for optimizing heteroepitaxial growth conditions in ultra-wide-bandgap power electronics applications.</p>

            <p>Ultrathin metal films exhibit liquid-like instabilities, rupturing via surface diffusion far below their melting points. This behavior constrains thermal budgets for advanced integrated circuits and emerging 2D-crystal devices. Here, we demonstrate that these instabilities can be fundamentally suppressed using graphene as a van der Waals (vdW) template. While conventional 20-nm-thick gold films break up into islands below 300 {\textdegree}C, templated films not only remain stable but also become structurally refined after annealing above 600 {\textdegree}C. This exceptional stability stems from a vdW-mediated crystallographic texture that reorganizes grain boundaries into a mechanically robust network. This mechanism significantly widens the processing window for nanoscale interconnects and enables high-temperature integration of metals with 2D-crystal technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari</p>
            <p>When a system is swept through a quantum critical point (QCP), the Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts that the average number of topological defects follows a universal power-law scaling with the ramp time scale. This scaling behavior is determined by the equilibrium critical exponents of the underlying phase transition. We show that the correspondence between Kibble-Zurek scaling and quantum criticality does not hold generally. In particular, the defect density can exhibit a suppression faster than the Kibble-Zurek prediction even when the quench crosses a critical point, while conventional Kibble-Zurek scaling may persist for quenches through a non-critical point. Our results, based on models representative of a broad class of quasi-one-dimensional Fermi systems, identify the dynamical conditions under which universal defect scaling emerges and clarify the relation between defect generation and equilibrium criticality.</p>

            <p>The magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE), which describes the rotation and ellipticity of linearly polarized light upon reflection, typically occurs in magnetic materials that break time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. Here we theoretically demonstrate that a similar effect can emerge even in two-dimensional nonmagnetic systems with $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, owing to the nontrivial quantum geometry of electrons. We reveal that the nematicity of the quantum metric, which corresponds to electric quadrupole moment of electron wave packets, gives rise to a Kerr-like effect (KLE) depending on the incident polarization angle. Notably, neither magnetic order nor spin-orbit coupling, which are conventionally considered essential for the MOKE, is required for its emergence. The KLE is demonstrated by using both a minimal tight-binding model and a model for strained MoS$_2$ with parameters determined by first-principle calculations. This work reveals a quantum-geometric origin for polarization rotation effects beyond the MOKE and offers a distinct approach to probe quantum geometry and multipole moments of electrons.</p>

            <p>Anisotropy in granular materials arises from both the internal fabric and the directionality of the stress state, yet separating these effects experimentally remains challenging. This study develops a first-order linearisation of the incremental stress-strain response that isolates mechanical anisotropy from structural anisotropy using two independent orientation measures. The formulation enables both contributions to be quantified directly from macroscopic laboratory data. The method is applied to hollow-cylinder tests with systematically varied loading directions. Results show that both anisotropy components intensify as the stress state becomes more deviatoric; mechanical anisotropy is consistently stronger; and its relative dominance decreases with increasing deviatoric stress. Comparison with an isotropic hypoplastic model confirms that mechanically induced directional effects are captured even without fabric anisotropy. The framework offers a practical and physically transparent means for quantifying and comparing anisotropy mechanisms in granular materials.</p>

            <h2>Periodic drive induced unconventional superconductivity in a half-filled system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suryashekhar Kusari, Arti Garg</p>
            <p>The non-equilibrium control of electronic properties has emerged as a transformative paradigm for engineering novel quantum phases. The most intriguing example of such a phase is light-induced superconductivity (SC) in non-superconducting materials. However, realizing unconventional SC at commensurate half-filling remains a formidable challenge even in non-equilibrium, as the regime is typically dominated by the robust stability of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating (MI) state. Here, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize unconventional d-wave SC in a half-filled system through Floquet engineering. We analyze the periodically driven Fermi-Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a high-frequency drive can transform a weakly interacting insulator into a regime of strong correlations by the drive-induced renormalization of nearest-neighbor hopping. Furthermore, the drive induces staggered higher range hoppings that can frustrate the AFM order while simultaneously generate staggered potential that lifts the kinetic constraints inherent to the half-filled system, fostering the charge dynamics required to stabilize d-wave pairing against the competing AFM state. The resulting SC phase is protected by high-frequency prethermalization, maintaining stability over timescales exponentially large in the drive frequency. This protocol circumvents the need for chemical doping, offering a 'disorder-free' alternative for realizing unconventional pairing with direct applications in optimizing the performance of superconducting quantum computers, qubit arrays and other upcoming quantum technologies.</p>

With these models, we determine that low-temperature droplets with finite lifetimes can exist in free space when the attraction between bosons and fermions is sufficiently strong. Additionally, Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures can exist in a box potential in equilibrium with bosonic and fermionic vapor. We discuss the properties of Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures in terms of the initial condensate fraction, total atom number, and interspecies attraction strength.</p>

Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of automating molecular structure identification from TERS images, bypassing traditional manual analysis.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Travis J. Williams, Douglas L. Abernathy, Mark D. Lumsden, Jiaqiang Yan, Andrew D. Christianson</p>
            <p>Recent experimental and theoretical studies have suggested a possible Dirac magnon gap in the two-dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductor CrSiTe$_3$. Detailed neutron scattering measurements were performed to shed light on the existence of the magnon gap, and suggest that the gap is very small or non-existent, with previous measurements being complicated by experimental factors. During these measurements, it was found that the out-of-plane couplings could explain the usual property of the increase in the magnetic transition temperature when CrSiTe$_3$ is exfoliated to monolayers. Furthermore, the material was shown to have anisotropic magnons along the out-of-plane direction, through the proposed Dirac point. We speculate that this is due to an exchange anisotropy, though Kitaev-like interactions alone cannot explain the spectra.</p>

            <p>Photoemission, from core levels and valence band, and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) have been employed to investigate the electronic and structural properties of novel graphene-ferromagnetic (G-FM) systems,obtained by intercalation of one mono-layer (1ML) and several layers (4ML) of Co on G grown on Ir(111). Upon intercalation of 1ML of Co, the Co lattice is resized to match the Ir-Ir lattice parameter, resulting in a mismatched G/Co/Ir(111) system. The intercalation of further Co layers leads to a relaxation of the Co lattice and a progressive formation of a commensurate G layer lying on top. We show the C 1s line shape and the band structure of G in the two artificial phases, mismatched and commensurate G/Co, through a comparison with the electronic structure of G grown directly on a Co thick film. Our results show that while the G valence band mainly reflects the hybridization with the d states of Co, regardless of the structural phase, the C 1s line shape is very sensitive to the rumpling of the G layer and the coordination of carbon atoms with the underlying Co. Even in the commensurate (1x1) G/Co phase, where graphene is in register with the Co film, from the angular dependence of the C 1s core level we infer the presence of a double component, due to in-equivalent adsorption sites of carbon sub-lattices.</p>

            <h2>Non Fermi liquid signatures across strain engineered metal-insulator transition in line-graph lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shashikant Singh Kunwar, Madhuparna Karmakar</p>
            <p>Controlling the properties and thus the functionalities of correlated electron systems via externally tunable perturbations has always remained a cherished goal in quantum condensed matter physics. Recently, straintronics has proved to be one such external control which can dictate the quantum phases and transitions in materials via the reconstruction of their electronic band structure. A particularly intriguing scenario arises in the context of flat band line-graph lattices wherein straintronics is found to bring forth non trivial phase transitions. This paper reports the phase transitions and thermal scales across the Lieb/Kagome interconversion in the electronic interaction-strain-temperature space. Based on the thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport signatures across the strain tuned interconversion of these line-graph lattices we have mapped out the low temperature phases and thermal transition scales, numerically determined using non perturbative calculations. While at the low temperatures, interaction-strain plane is spanned by magnetically correlated insulators, flat band induced weak transiently localized insulators and non Fermi liquid metallic phases, thermal fluctuations aid in to stabilize coexistent magnetic correlations. Apart from quantifying the magnetic transition scales in this system our results on the spectroscopic and transport signatures distill the strain tuned metal-insulator transition and crossover scales which exhibit variable transport scaling exponents.</p>

            <h2>The interplay of cation/anion and monovalent/divalent selectivity in negatively charged nanopores: local charge inversion and anion leakage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eszter Lakics, Mónika Valiskó, Dirk Gillespie, Dezső Boda</p>
            <p>The anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE) is widely regarded as a hallmark of calcium versus monovalent ion selectivity in negatively charged pores. While AMFE is well understood in highly cation-selective narrow ion channels, its microscopic origin in wide synthetic nanopores, where anions may also contribute to transport, remains less clear. Here, we use a reduced Nernst-Planck + Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo framework to study ionic transport in a negatively charged PET nanopore, with particular emphasis on how the modeling of surface carboxyl (COO$^{-}$) groups influences charge inversion, ionic currents, and AMFE. We systematically compare fixed point-charge models and explicit-particle representations of surface oxygens and identify two controlling parameters: the distance of closest approach (DCA) between ionic charges and pore charges and grid spacing that modulates localization (while keeping average surface charge constant). By fitting pore diffusion coefficients to three experimental conductance points, we reproduce the entire experimental AMFE curve as well as anion leakage in CaCl$_2$ seen in experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, vastly different microscopic models of the surface groups yield indistinguishable device-level conductance curves when the DCA is matched, despite substantial differences in local Ca$^{2+}$ concentration profiles. Our results demonstrate that AMFE in wide nanopores is governed by a delicate interplay between charge inversion, anion leakage, and ionic mobility, underlying that in wide pores monovalent vs.\ divalent cation selectivity is modulated by cations vs.\ anion selecivity.</p>

This method makes it possible to quantify the distribution of characteristic length scales in cases where the conventional "linear" chord method does not work.

The method should be widely applicable to other, finite quasi-two-dimensional patterns.</p>

            <p>The magnetic moment in van der Waals (vdW) materials containing 3d transition metals originates from unpaired d-electron spins and their interaction with surrounding ligands. The interplay between exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy stabilizes long-range ordering of such moments. The compound CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) presents an interesting class of vdW solids where the coupling of Cr3+ moments and ordering of Cu1+ ions give rise to a multiferroic ground state. Here we investigate the spin dynamics of Cr3+ ions in CCPS through magnetization and broadband as well as single sub-THz magnetic resonance measurements. The orbital moment of Cr3+ is quenched under the octahedral crystal field of surrounding chalcogen ions, resulting in negligible magnetic anisotropy-a feature common to Cr-based vdW antiferromagnets (AFM). Resonance spectra over a wide frequency-field-temperature range reveal quasi-2D AFM dynamics governed mainly by isotropic Cr-Cr exchange interactions, which determine the magnetic order, spin reorientation, and damping. Sub-THz resonance spectra also uncover a field-induced ferromagnetic polarization, highlighting the universal role of Cr-Cr exchange in layered Cr compounds. Moreover, persistent magnetic correlations far above the Néel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) points to short-range magnetic order in CCPS and motivates future studies of a possible interplay between AFM and antiferroelectric orders. These results establish CCPS as an exemplary system for exploring 2D magnetism and electric-field-tunable spintronic functionalities in layered multiferroics.</p>

            <h2>The effect of the A-site cation on the phase transition temperature of metal halide perovskites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Braeckevelt, Sander Vandenhaute, Sven M. J. Rogge, Johan Hofkens, Veronique Van Speybroeck</p>
            <p>A key challenge for the practical application of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is the instability of the desired perovskite phase relative to the optically non-active $\delta$ phase. To determine the phase stability, we previously developed a procedure to compute the harmonic free energy as a function of temperature, which was suited for CsPbI$_3$ but fails when Cs is replaced by organic cations due to their rotational freedom. Herein we propose a multistep thermodynamic integration (TI) approach that corrects the harmonic free energy to obtain the Gibbs free energy. Given the abundance of local minima in these materials, we employ replica exchange to prevent simulations from getting trapped, while introducing an intermediate potential energy surface to improve convergence and reduce computational cost. Benchmarking energy and forces from different exchange-correlation functionals and dispersion methods against high-level RPA+HF calculations identifies PBE+D3(BJ) as the best trade-off between accuracy, computational efficiency, and precision. To perform molecular dynamics simulations within the TI framework, it was necessary to train a machine learning potential using the MACE architecture on ab initio data calculated with density functional theory. Our results show that, for all three materials, the free energy difference between the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ phases exhibits a very similar temperature dependence. This suggests that phase stability is primarily governed by differences in ground-state energy, rather than by material-specific thermal effects. Beyond these three materials, our methodology provides a robust framework for investigating the phase behavior of other MHPs, paving the way for the discovery of more stable perovskites.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Scholle, Pietro M. Bonetti, Walter Metzner, Demetrio Vilardi</p>
            <p>We perform a renormalized mean-field study of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model, focusing on the intricate interplay and possible coexistence of magnetic, charge, and superconducting orders. We improve on conventional mean-field theory by utilizing a renormalization group framework that captures high-energy fluctuations. This method generates effective magnetic and $d$-wave pairing interactions, and allows for an unbiased exploration of coexisting phases at weak and moderate interaction strengths. Unrestricted mean-field calculations of the effective Hamiltonian on large finite lattices are combined with analyses in the thermodynamic limit, revealing a rich phase diagram with extensive regions of coexisting orders. We find that $d$-wave superconductivity coexists with Néel order on the electron-doped side. On the hole-doped side, superconductivity is found to coexist with spiral or stripe magnetic orders. Within the stripe ordered region, the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated, with a period that follows the charge modulation of the stripes. Below van Hove filling, pairing provides the primary energy gain, while the stripe order yields only a small, and hence fragile, additional energy lowering.</p>

            <h2>Chemotaxis of cell aggregates: morphology and dynamics of migrating active droplets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia L. Celora, Benjamin J. Walker, Mohit P. Dalwadi, Philip Pearce</p>
            <p>Biological tissues have been observed to display emergent fluid-like properties, owing to physical interactions between cells. However, it remains unclear in general how these fluid-like properties affect tissue structure and function. Here, we are motivated by recent experiments in which cell aggregates were observed to behave as active droplets during collective migration along chemical gradients, or chemotaxis. To understand this process, we develop a minimal model of a growing thin active droplet driven by a self-generated chemical gradient. In broad agreement with the experiments, dynamic simulations reveal that chemotacting droplets exhibit proliferation-driven morphological transitions. To fully characterise these transitions, we perform a multiple scales analysis to show that the droplet dynamics follow a sequence of travelling wave solutions defined by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem parametrised by the slowly increasing droplet volume. Our analysis reveals that morphological transitions can occur continuously or through a discontinuous bifurcation. Further asymptotic analysis of the travelling wave problem reveals that these morphological transitions arise from exponentially small ("beyond-all-orders") asymptotic terms that originate from the rear and front contact lines. Moreover, we show that the nature of the transitions is fully determined by two key dimensionless parameters, which quantify the internal stress balance within the droplet and the strength of the coupling between the droplet migration dynamics and the external chemical field. Overall, our results provide a complete characterisation of the morphodynamics of a class of migrating active thin droplets, with implications in a range of biological systems where cell aggregates exhibit fluid-like behaviour.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Brodoloni, G. E. Astrakharchik, S. Giorgini, S. Pilati</p>
            <p>The performance of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization is fundamentally limited by the minimum energy gap $\Delta$ encountered at quantum phase transitions. We investigate the scaling of $\Delta$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $\Delta$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $\Delta \propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiawen Zhang, Wenjun Lu, Xufei Fang</p>
            <p>Recent advancements in dislocation engineering are reshaping the traditional view towards ceramics being brittle. Here, we use KTaO3 (KTO), a perovskite oxide that is newly discovered with room-temperature bulk plasticity, and demonstrate that the seeded dislocations can effectively tune both mechanical and functional properties. We uncover a novel brittle-ductile-brittle (BDB) transition: low dislocation densities lead to brittle failure, intermediate densities (~10*14 m-2) enable superior ductility with strains over 20%, and high dislocation densities (~10*15 m-2) induce again brittle fracture. This dislocation density-dependent non-monotonic mechanical response challenges the traditional behavior of ceramics and offers new design opportunities. Furthermore, dislocation densities can monotonically decrease thermal conductivity, revealing a tradeoff between mechanical strength and functionality. The findings reveal a critical threshold of dislocation density in optimizing the performance of functional oxides, and provide a new framework for using dislocations to design advanced materials where mechanical durability and enhanced functionality are intertwined.</p>

            <p>Improving the performance of metallic implants increasingly relies on the development of multifunctional surface modifications that combine structural stability, bioactivity, and prevention of bacterial colonization. Medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) represent a promising approach for such coatings, as their chemical complexity allows the formation of structurally stable matrices with tunable properties. In this study, Ti-Nb-Zr and Ti-Nb-Zr-Ag thin films were deposited by magnetron sputtering and subjected to annealing at temperatures of up to 1100 $^{\circ}$C to evaluate the influence of Ag, added for its antibacterial potential, on structural evolution. The as-deposited Ag-free film was fully amorphous, whereas the Ag-containing film exhibited a predominantly amorphous matrix with finely dispersed crystalline nanoparticles, indicating that Ag promoted early-stage crystallization. Both films displayed a fine columnar morphology (column diameter $\sim$15 nm) with dome-like protrusions, a hierarchical surface structure favorable for protein adhesion. Upon annealing, the Ag-free film recrystallized into a granular, loosely packed morphology, while the Ag-containing film retained a compact structure, demonstrating the stabilizing role of Ag. These findings underscore the potential of Ag-containing amorphous MEAs for forming multifunctional coatings with enhanced thermal stability, antibacterial functionality, and biointerface-relevant surface features for advanced biomedical applications.</p>

            <h2>Role of octahedral tilting induced acoustic softening on limiting thermal transport in SrSnO3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhou Hao, Turab Lookman, Xiangdong Ding, Jun Sun, Zhibin Gao</p>
            <p>Octahedral tilting is a fundamental structural distortion in perovskites, governing key phenomena such as lattice stabilizing, soft phonon dynamics, group-theoretical analysis, phase transitions, ferroelectricity, and even for tunable electronic band gap. However, its influence on lattice thermal conductivity (kL) remains poorly understood. In the archetypal perovskite SrTiO3, tilting in the low-temperature tetragonal phase is known to enhance kL by suppressing specific phonon scattering channels around 200 cm-1. Here, we investigate the thermal transport in strontium stannate (SrSnO3), another perovskite oxide that undergoes temperature-driven phase transitions, and reveal a completely opposite effect. Through a systematic study across its orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic phases, we demonstrate that octahedral tilting in the tetragonal phase of SrSnO3 anomalously triggers acoustic phonon softening. This softening manifests as reduced frequencies and group velocities in low-frequency (<3 THz) acoustic modes, creating a large decrease for heat transport, particularly along the c-axis. Consequently, kL is significantly suppressed, decreasing from 7.48 W m-1 K-1 to 6.06 W m-1 K-1 as the tilting angle increases by a mere 1 degree. These findings identify tilting-induced acoustic softening as a pivotal mechanism for limiting and controlling anisotropic thermal transport in SrSnO3, presenting a stark contrast to the established behavior in SrTiO3.</p>

Analysis of this regime allows us to identify the quantum tunneling of vortices, which transitions to thermally activated behaviour at elevated temperatures.

            <p>Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted significant attention owing to their simple manufacturing process and unique optoelectronic properties. Their reversible electrical or optical properties changes in response to oxidizing or reducing environments make them prospective materials for gas detection technologies. Despite advancements in perovskite-based sensor research, the mechanisms behind perovskite-gas interactions, vital for sensor performance, are still unexclusive. This work presents the first evaluation of the sensing performance and long-term stability of MHPs, considering factors such as halide composition variation and Mn doping levels. The research reveals a clear correlation between halide composition and sensing behavior, with Br-rich sensors displaying a p-type response to O3 gas, while Cl-based counterparts exhibit an n-type sensing behavior. Notably, Mn-doping significantly enhances the O3 sensing performance by facilitating the gas adsorption process, as supported by both atomistic simulations and experimental evidence. Long-term evaluation of the sensors provides valuable insights into evolving sensing behaviors, highlighting the impact of dynamic instabilities over time. Overall, this research offers insights into optimal halide combination and Mn-doping levels, representing a significant step forward in engineering room temperature perovskite-based gas sensors that are not only low-cost and high-performing but also durable, marking a new era in sensor technology.</p>

            <p>Sampling equilibrium distributions is fundamental to statistical mechanics. While flow matching has emerged as scalable state-of-the-art paradigm for generative modeling, its potential for equilibrium sampling in condensed-phase systems remains largely unexplored. We address this by incorporating the periodicity inherent to these systems into continuous normalizing flows using Riemannian flow matching. The high computational cost of exact density estimation intrinsic to continuous normalizing flows is mitigated by using Hutchinson's trace estimator, utilizing a crucial bias-correction step based on cumulant expansion to render the stochastic estimates suitable for rigorous thermodynamic reweighting. Our approach is validated on monatomic ice, demonstrating the ability to train on systems of unprecedented size and obtain highly accurate free energy estimates without the need for traditional multistage estimators.</p>

We demonstrate that tuning this phase substantially reduces the critical driving strength for dissipative phase transitions between stationary and non-stationary phases. We illustrate this mechanism in two experimentally relevant cavity QED settings: a two-species ensemble of two-level atoms and a single-species ensemble of three-level atoms. Our results establish phase control as a versatile tool for engineering dissipative phase transitions, with implications for quantum state preparation.</p>

            <h2>Learning Beyond Optimization: Stress-Gated Dynamical Regime Regulation in Autonomous Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng Ran</p>
            <p>Despite their apparent diversity, modern machine learning methods can be reduced to a remarkably simple core principle: learning is achieved by continuously optimizing parameters to minimize or maximize a scalar objective function. This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization.</p>

            <p>Interfaces that couple digital information with physical matter enable computation to be expressed through tangible motion and touch, yet typically rely on embedded actuators, rigid mechanisms, or enclosed environments. Consequently, contactless manipulation and interaction with centimeter-scale tangible elements in open settings remain difficult to achieve. Here, we present PolygonWave, a solid--fluid acoustic interface that enables transport and tangible interaction by coupling airborne ultrasound with liquid-mediated support. The system employs lightweight Janus icons with asymmetric wettability: a superhydrophobic upper surface permits dry touch interaction, while a hydrophilic lower surface couples to a water droplet resting on a superhydrophobic mesh. Focused acoustic fields generated by a 256-element phased array induce lateral forces, enabling programmable motion without mechanical contact. Systematic characterization demonstrates transport of payloads up to 525 mg across variations in icon size, droplet volume, and applied load. Beyond translation, the liquid layer functions as a reconfigurable mechanical element, enabling button-like input with self-recovery and resonance-driven vibro-visual feedback, exhibiting a peak response near 22 Hz for 200 \textmu L droplets. Liquid-mediated acoustic coupling provides a unified mechanism for mechanically expressive, touch-accessible tangible interfaces bridging acoustics, soft matter physics, and physical human--computer interaction.</p>

We highlight the biological relevance of this framework: the resulting bounds apply to quasi-steady-state regimes, where long transients and plateau-like behavior are common and functionally important.

            <p>The nonstabilizerness of quantum states is a necessary resource for universal quantum computation, yet its characterization is notoriously demanding. Quantifying nonstabilizerness typically requires an exponential number of measurements and a doubly exponential classical post-processing cost to evaluate its standard monotones. In this work, we show that nonstabilizerness is, to a large extent, in the eyes of the beholder: it can be witnessed and quantified using any set of $m$ $n$-qubit Pauli measurements, provided the set contains anti-commuting pairs. We introduce a general framework that projects the stabilizer polytope onto the subspace defined by these observables and provide an algorithm that estimates magic from Pauli expectation values with runtime exponential in the number of measurements $m$ and polynomial in the number of qubits $n$. By relating the problem to a stabilizer-restricted variant of the quantum marginal problem, we also prove that deciding membership in the corresponding reduced stabilizer polytope is NP-hard. In particular, unless $\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{NP}$, no algorithm polynomial in $m$ can solve the problem in full generality, thus establishing fundamental complexity-theoretic limitations. Finally, we employ our framework to compute nonstabilizerness in different Hamiltonian ground states, demonstrating the practical performance of our method in regimes beyond the reach of existing techniques.</p>

We consider the microscopic potential created by a lattice, and add a macroscopic potential with the same periodicity but varying at a scale $\varepsilon^{-1} \in \mathbb{N}$, creating a superlattice. Our approach consists in coupling the variational approximation, perturbation theory together with a multiscale method. At the effective level the usual massless Dirac operator is replaced by other operators, and we provide simulations in the case of graphene.</p>

            <h2>Artificial Neural Network (ANN) -- Oscillatory Neural Network (ONN) Hybrid System Using Domain-Wall Synapse Devices and Nano-Constriction Spin Hall Nano Oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raman Hissariya, Gajjala Venkata Sreekar Reddy, Ashwin Tulapurkar, Debanjan Bhowmik</p>
            <p>A coupled spintronic oscillator array has been considered attractive for neuromorphic computing applications. Experimental reports have shown the nano-constriction geometry to be a relatively easier-to-fabricate platform for implementing such spin oscillators, but most prior reports on training and inference algorithms for neuromorphic computing using spin oscillators have been mostly restricted to the nano-pillar geometry. Also, those prior reports involve updating the natural frequency values of the oscillators and moving the synchronization regions on to the data clusters during the offline learning phase, which has associated challenges. In this context, we design and simulate a novel artificial neural network (ANN) - oscillator neural network (ONN) algorithm where in the offline learning phase, the weight parameters of the ANN are updated such that the data clusters are instead moved to the synchronization regions of spin Hall nano oscillators (SHNOs) in the nano-constriction geometry, as obtained through micromagnetic simulations. We further simulate the on-chip inference part of the ANN-ONN algorithm where the ANN is implemented on a crossbar array of domain-wall synapse devices, as simulated here through micromagnetics, and the ONN is implemented on nano-constriction SHNOs. We show successful data classification for both binary and multi-class classification tasks to demonstrate the generalizability of our proposed scheme.</p>

            <p>We consider physical Hamiltonians that can be represented by the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles, theoretically derive the state ensembles for its eigenstates and analyze the effect of varying system conditions on its bipartite entanglement entropy. Our approach leads to a single parametric based common mathematical formulation for the evolution of the entanglement statistics of different states of a given Hamiltonian or different Hamiltonians subjected to same symmetry constraints. The parameter turns out to be a single functional of the system parameters and thereby reveals a deep web of connection hidden underneath different quantum states.</p>

            <p>We analyze a time-continuous version of a cellular automaton decoder for the toric code in the form of a Lindblad master equation. In this setting, a self-correcting quantum memory becomes a thermodynamical phase of the steady state, which manifests itself through the steady state being topologically ordered. We compute the steady state phase diagram, finding a competition between the error correction rate and the update rate for the classical field of the cellular automaton. Strikingly, we find that self-correction of errors is possible even in situations where conventional quantum error correction does not have a finite threshold.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kausik Das, Hai Zhu, Marc Bonnet, Shravan Veerapaneni</p>
            <p>We consider arbitrary-shaped microswimmers of spherical topology and propose a framework for expressing their slip velocity in terms of tangential basis functions defined on the boundary of the swimmer using the Helmholtz decomposition. Given a time-independent slip velocity profile, we show that the trajectory followed by the microswimmer is a circular helix. We derive analytical expressions for the translational and rotational velocities of a prolate spheroid swimmer in terms of its Helmholtz decomposition modes and explore the effect of aspect ratio on these rigid body velocities. Then, for a given arbitrary swimmer shape of spherical topology, we investigate which slip profile minimizes the total power loss. A partial minimization is performed in which the direction of net motion of the swimmer is prescribed, followed by a global optimization procedure in which the best net motion direction is determined. The optimization results suggest that the competition between linear and rotational optimal motion is linked to symmetries in the shape of the microswimmer.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of opinion splits in the Sznajd model with latency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan W. Salatti, André M. Timpanaro</p>
            <p>In the modelling of social systems, opinion latency is the idea that once an agent changes its opinion, there will be a period of time where it is immune to other changes. When added to the voter model this leads to a situation where no matter how low the latency is or how many opinions are considered, all opinions end up in a coexistence where they are equally represented. In this work, we examine what happens when latency is added to the Sznajd model. What we find is that for low latency, the model behaves roughly like it does in the absence of latency, where one opinion will always eventually dominate. For high latency, the possibility for a symmetric coexistence of 2 opinions arises, but contrary to the voter model, a coexistence of more than 2 opinions is never stable. We provide evidence of this phenomenon with computer simulations of the model in Barabási-Albert networks, together with a mean field treatment that is able to capture the observed behavior. We argue that this could hint at an explanation for the prevalence of two opinion splits in the real world.</p>

            <p>Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a versatile quantum error-correcting family built out of commuting $X$- and $Z$-type checks. We introduce CSS-like codes on $G$-valued qudits for any finite group $G$ that reduce to qubit CSS codes for $G = \mathbb{Z}_2$ yet generalize the Kitaev quantum double model for general groups. The $X$-checks of our group-CSS codes correspond to left and/or right multiplication by group elements, while $Z$-checks project onto solutions to group word equations. We describe quantum-double models on oriented two-dimensional CW complexes (which need not cellulate a manifold) and prove that, when $G$ is non-Abelian and simple, every $G$-covariant group-CSS code with suitably upper-bounded $Z$-check weight and lower-bounded $Z$-distance reduces to a CW quantum double. We describe the codespace and logical operators of CW quantum doubles via the same intuition used to obtain logical structure of surface codes. We obtain distance bounds for codes on non-Abelian simple groups from the graph underlying the CW complex, and construct intrinsically non-Abelian code families with asymptotically optimal rate and distances. Adding "ghost vertices" to the CW complex generalizes quantum double models with defects and rough boundary conditions whose logical structure can be understood without reference to non-Abelian anyons or defects. Several non-invertible symmetry-protected topological states, both with ordinary and higher-form symmetries, are the unique codewords of simply-connected CW quantum doubles with a single ghost vertex.</p>

            <p>Visualizing the spatial profile of light beams is essential for evaluating irradiance, characterizing beam quality, and achieving precise alignment. In the optical spectral range, this is readily performed using silicon-based CCD and CMOS cameras. In the terahertz (THz) range, however, it typically requires specialized detectors with prohibitive costs. Here, we show that an infrared (IR) camera can be used outside of its labeled specifications to achieve similar performance as a dedicated microbolometric THz camera, at under 1% of the THz camera's cost. We compared the cameras by characterizing THz beam profiles from two sources: a pulsed broadband THz beam produced through optical rectification in organic crystals, and a narrowband quasi-continuous-wave (quasi-CW) THz beam emitted by a quantum cascade laser. For the broadband THz radiation, the beam width measured by the two cameras differed by only ~ 6%, well within the pixel resolution limit, and in the narrowband quasi-CW case by just ~ 1.3%. Additionally, both cameras show linear responsivity over a comparable irradiance range. These results expand the applicability of conventional IR cameras to the THz range, suggesting that they will become routine tools for high-fidelity THz beam diagnostics and imaging in scientific and industrial applications.</p>

            <h2>Differentiable Maximum Likelihood Noise Estimation for Quantum Error Correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanyan Cao, Dongyang Feng, Cheng Ye, Feng Pan</p>
            <p>Accurate noise estimation is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing, as decoding performance depends critically on the fidelity of the circuit-level noise parameters. In this work, we introduce a differentiable Maximum Likelihood Estimation (dMLE) framework that enables exact, efficient, and fully differentiable computation of syndrome log-likelihoods, allowing circuit-level noise parameters to be optimized directly via gradient descent. Leveraging the exact Planar solver for repetition codes and a novel, simplified Tensor Network (TN) architecture combined with optimized contraction path finding for surface codes, our method achieves tractable and fully differentiable likelihood evaluation even for distance 5 surface codes with up to 25 rounds. Our method recovers the underlying error probabilities with near-exact precision in simulations and reduces logical error rates by up to 30.6(3)% for repetition codes and 8.1(2)% for surface codes on experimental data from Google's processor compared to previous state-of-the-art methods: correlation analysis and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. Our approach yields provably optimal, decoder-independent error priors by directly maximizing the syndrome likelihood, offering a powerful noise estimation and control tool for unlocking the full potential of current and future error-corrected quantum processors.</p>

            <p>We develop a spectral-resolvent framework for computing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) using Krylov subspace methods, extending the notion of the Krylov distribution. By expressing the QFI as a resolvent moment of the superoperator $\mathcal{K}_\rho$ associated with a density matrix, the Krylov distribution quantifies how the QFI weight is distributed across Krylov levels in operator space and provides a natural measure for controlling the truncation error in Krylov approximations. Leveraging orthogonal polynomial theory, we identify two universal convergence regimes: exponential decay when the Liouville-space spectrum is gapped away from zero, and algebraic decay governed by hard-edge (Bessel) universality when small eigenvalues accumulate near zero. This framework establishes a direct connection between quantum metrology, spectral geometry, and Krylov dynamics, offering both conceptual insight and practical tools for efficient QFI computation in high-dimensional and many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Exact stochastic simulation of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) is essential when discreteness and noise drive system behavior, but the hard categorical event selection in Gillespie-type algorithms blocks gradient-based learning. We eliminate this constraint by decoupling forward simulation from backward differentiation, with hard categorical sampling generating exact trajectories and gradients propagating through a continuous massively-parallel Gumbel-Softmax straight-through surrogate. Our approach enables accurate optimization at parameter scales over four orders of magnitude beyond existing simulators. We validate for accuracy, scalability, and reliability on a reversible dimerization model (0.09% error), a genetic oscillator (1.2% error), a 203,796-parameter gene regulatory network achieving 98.4% MNIST accuracy (a prototypical deep-learning multilayer perceptron benchmark), and experimental patch-clamp recordings of ion channel gating (R^2 = 0.987) in the single-channel regime. Our GPU implementation delivers 1.9 billion steps per second, matching the scale of non-differentiable simulators. By making exact stochastic simulation massively parallel and autodiff-compatible, our results enable high-dimensional parameter inference and inverse design across systems biology, chemical kinetics, physics, and related CTMC-governed domains.</p>

            <p>Highly excited Rydberg states of lanthanides are a promising, yet largely unexplored, playground for quantum studies. Here, we report on the first high-resolution spectroscopy of 162Dy obtained by two-color trap depletion spectroscopy in a magneto-optical trap. The absolute excitation frequency of over 700 states with effective principal quantum number n between 21 and 130 is measured with an accuracy of 20 MHz. Most states are assigned to the 8 different series converging to the first 4f10(5I8)6s(2S1/2) J = 17/2 ionization potential. This energy is measured at EIP = 47901.8265 +/- 0.0008 cm-1, improving the precision of the literature value by over an order of magnitude. A multichannel quantum defect theory approach is used to benchmark and refine the assignments and to characterize six observed perturbing states belonging to higher ionization limits. These results pave the way for using dysprosium in Rydberg-based quantum architectures, leveraging the unique properties arising from its complex electronic structure. They also represent a compelling benchmark for ab-initio calculations of open-shell atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Local Hilbert spaces with large dimension are of key interest for quantum information with applications in quantum computing and memories, quantum simulations and metrology. Thanks to its weak coupling to external perturbations, the large ground-state nuclear spin manifold of fermionic alkaline-earth atoms is an exciting resource to explore for quantum information. Simultaneous single atom and state-resolved detection however remains an outstanding challenge limiting the development of novel quantum computing and simulation schemes beyond qubits. Here, we report on a new imaging technique enabling the simultaneous detection of up to four quantum states encoded in the nuclear spin manifold of a single fermionic strontium atom within 100 microseconds, with state-resolved detection fidelities ranging from 0.936 to 0.997. This technique is further used to track the highly coherent nuclear spin dynamics after a quench highlighting the potential of this system for quantum information. These results offer fascinating perspectives for quantum science with multi-electron atoms ranging from qudit-based quantum computing to quantum simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model.</p>

            <p>Quantitative understanding of coupled reaction and transport processes in lithium-ion battery (LIB) composite electrodes remains challenging because key internal states cannot be measured directly. In this study, we develop a physics-integrated, data-driven analysis pipeline to estimate internal electrochemical states from operando microscopic X-ray absorption fine structure ($\mu$-XAFS) hyperspectral data of LIB cathodes with LiPF$_6$ electrolyte. State-of-charge (SOC) maps are first constructed from Co K-edge spectra. To resolve ambiguities in the two-phase reaction region, a physics-regularized three-layer neural network is introduced, enforcing spatial continuity of SOC and current conservation. The inferred SOC dynamics are then incorporated into a Kirchhoff-based Markov random field framework that integrates Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, Ohm's law, and a symmetric Butler-Volmer relation to estimate interfacial current, ionic current, electrolyte potential, and effective ionic conductivity. Application to composite electrodes with different initial electrolyte concentrations (0.3, 1, and 2M LiPF$_6$) reveals distinct reaction propagation behaviors governed by electrolyte concentration-dependent conductivity. The inferred electrolyte concentration distributions show qualitative agreement with independent operando X-ray transmission imaging performed on LIB composite cathodes employing a LiAsF$_6$ electrolyte. This framework enables quantitative visualization of otherwise inaccessible internal transport phenomena.</p>

To validate the proposed approach, we compare the results with those obtained using a classical macroscopic method.

            <p>We provide a theoretical model for the non-equilibrium steady state heat flow through a quantum heat valve. The model is based on a master equation approach, where the partial secular approximation has been carefully performed in order to obtain accurate results. Our study assumes an ohmic spectral density for the two thermal baths of the model. This is in contrast with previous treatments of the quantum heat valve, where the baths have been assumed as being structured with a peaked spectral density near the resonance frequency of the resonator. These studies have also taken the resonator to be a part of the open quantum system of interest, which results in double counting of the resonator, as the latter appears both in the spectral density of the bath and as a part of the open system. Although this model accounts for the observations in a satisfactory way, it raises issues regarding its physical interpretation. Our method solves this conceptual problem. We apply it to describe an experiment on a quantum heat valve, showing that it successfully captures the experimental results and improves upon the previous theoretical model, which suffered from the resonator double-counting issue. Our findings confirm that the careful application of the master equation approach, in particular when it comes to the secular approximation, is a useful tool for explaining realistic experimental setups.</p>

            <p>In this work, the entanglement generation between two hexagonal-lattice layers embedded in a microcavity is studied, accounting for both electromagnetic coupling and intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Utilizing a short-time dynamical approach, we perform a perturbative Taylor expansion of the reduced density matrix to characterize the bipartite quantum correlations between the hexagonal layers. We demonstrate that the system undergoes a rapid transition from a localized product state in the conduction bands at t = 0 to a coherent superposition of valence and conduction band states. Our results indicate that the degree of entanglement is highly sensitive to the interlayer photon propagator, which contains the geometric ratios of the layer positions and the height cavity, and the specific Fermi energy and SOI signatures of the respective layers. We show the emergence of spacelike-separated quantum correlations in the ultra-short evolution regime, suggesting that heterostructures in cavities may be suitable to develop experiments for a deep understanding of spacelike-separated quantum effects.</p>

We then perform a systematic search over various stabilizer realizations and lattice geometries for $p\in\{3,5,7,11\}$, identifying qudit low-density parity-check codes with the optimal finite-size performance. Representative examples include $[[242,10,22]]_3$ and $[[120,6,20]]_{11}$, both achieving $k d^{2}/n=20$. Across the searched regime, the best observed $k d^{2}$ at fixed $n$ increases with $p$, with an empirical relation $k d^{2} = 0.0541 \, n^{2}\ln p + 3.84 \, n$, compatible with a Bravyi--Poulin--Terhal-type tradeoff when the interaction range grows with system size.</p>

            <p>While most of the existing quantum information engines assisted by Maxwell's demon harness thermal fluctuations, those that rectify only quantum fluctuations have recently been constructed. We propose an alternative type of quantum information engine that harnesses only quantum fluctuations to achieve cumulative energy storage and unidirectional transport of a particle. This unidirectional transport makes a stark contrast with the case without Maxwell's demon where the motion of a particle is confined to a finite region due to Bloch oscillations. We find a trade-off relationship between the maximum power and the maximum velocity. With an improved definition of efficiency that includes all possible energy flows in the engine cycle, we numerically demonstrate the absence of a trade-off relationship among power, efficiency, and power fluctuations that is present for classical heat engines and classical information engines. We also evaluate the influence of experimentally unavoidable measurement imprecision on the performance of the quantum Maxwell's demon.</p>

            <p>We study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories proposed to describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e., the momentum-space manifolds of Green's function zeros (GFZs) at zero energy, in strongly interacting fermionic systems. In particular, we focus on simplest possible cases associated with a gapless Dirac zero, which is the counterpart of the gapless Dirac quasiparticle in weakly interacting systems. These theories may be derived by integrating out low-energy degrees of freedom that do not couple to the relevant gauge field. We discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on phases consistent with the anomaly, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. Failing to avoid a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the thermodynamical limit inevitably leads unstable GFZs. We also provide some perspectives on why the related nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied recently is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</p>

We analyse their vdW interactions perturbatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. Our findings are confirmed here via the first detailed analysis of a 4-cylinder vdW model. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening.

            <p>We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time, remaining spatially uniform at each time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with ``ultrafast'' dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits. The implications of our results on the general stability of phase transitions and ordered phases to such temporal randomness are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Dual-Spaces Invariance as a Universal Criterion for Identifying Multifractal Critical States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tong Liu</p>
            <p>In Anderson localization physics, eigenstates of disordered quantum systems are commonly classified as extended, localized, or critical, distinguished by their distinct spatial structures in real space. While critical states are known to exhibit multifractal characteristics, a precise and operational criterion for characterizing critical states remains an open challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by revisiting criticality from a dual-spaces perspective that treats position and momentum representations on equal footing. Building on the Liu--Xia criterion, which characterizes critical states by the simultaneous vanishing of Lyapunov exponents ($\gamma=\gamma_m=0$) in both spaces, we show that this dual-spaces characterization captures an essential feature of critical states that is not limited to Lyapunov exponents. In particular, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inverse participation ratio exhibits closely related scaling behavior in position and momentum space for critical states. This position-momentum correspondence clearly distinguishes critical states from extended or localized ones, which instead display a pronounced asymmetry between the two representations. Our results establish a robust and universal framework for precisely characterizing multifractal critical states in disordered quantum systems, and provide practical guidance for their identification in current quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <p>Recently, high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ ultrathin film with critical temperature $T_c$ above the McMillan limit at ambient pressure (AP). It is eager to enhance $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. We propose that a perpendicular electric field strongly enhances $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Under electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing is suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is strongly enhanced. We numerically verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between layers is enough to realize liquid-nitrogen-temperature HTSC in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</p>

            <h2>Is a phonon excitation of a superfluid Bose gas a Goldstone boson?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maksim Tomchenko</p>
            <p>It is generally accepted that phonons in a superfluid Bose gas are Goldstone bosons. This is justified by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), which is usually defined as follows: the Hamiltonian of the system is invariant under the $U(1)$ transformation $\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)\rightarrow e^{i\alpha}% \hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)$, whereas the order parameter $\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ is not. However, the strict definition of SSB is different: the Hamiltonian and the boundary conditions are invariant under a symmetry transformation, while the ground state is not. Based on the latter criterion, we study a finite system of spinless, weakly interacting bosons using three approaches: the standard Bogoliubov method, the particle-number-conserving Bogoliubov method, and the approach based on the exact ground-state wave function. Our results show that the answer to the question in the title is ``no''. Thus, phonons in a real-world (finite) superfluid Bose gas are similar to sound in a classical gas: they are not Goldstone bosons, but quantised collective vibrational modes arising from the interaction between atoms. In the case of an infinite Bose gas, however, the picture becomes paradoxical: the ground state can be regarded as either infinitely degenerate or non-degenerate, making the phonon both similar to a Goldstone boson and different from it.</p>

            <h2>Localizing entropy production along non-equilibrium trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Biswajit Das, Sreekanth K Manikandan</p>
            <p>An important open problem in nonequilibrium thermodynamics is the quantification and spatiotemporal localisation of entropy production in complex processes from experimental data. Here we address this issue through a data-driven approach that combines the recently developed short-time thermodynamic uncertainty relation based inference scheme with machine learning techniques. Our approach leverages the flexible function representation provided by deep neural networks to achieve accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional, potentially time-dependent dissipative force fields as well as the localization of fluctuating entropy production in both space and time along nonequilibrium trajectories. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework through applications to diverse systems of fundamental interest and experimental significance, where it successfully addresses distinct challenges in localising entropy production.</p>

            <h2>Minimal thermodynamic cost of computing with circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Yadav, Mahran Yousef, David Wolpert</p>
            <p>All digital devices have components that implement Boolean functions, mapping that component's input to its output. However, any fixed Boolean function can be implemented by an infinite number of circuits, all of which vary in their resource costs. This has given rise to the field of circuit complexity theory, which studies the minimal resource cost to implement a given Boolean function with any circuit. Traditionally, circuit complexity theory has focused on the resource costs of a circuit's size (its number of gates) and depth (the longest path length from the circuit's input to its output). In this paper, we extend circuit complexity theory by investigating the minimal thermodynamic cost of a circuit's operation. We do this by using the mismatch cost (MMC) of a given circuit that is run multiple times in a row to calculate a lower bound on the entropy production (EP) incurred in each such run. Specifically, we discuss conditions under which MMC of a circuit is proportional to the size of a circuit, and when they are not. We also use our results to compare the thermodynamic costs of different circuit families implementing the same family of Boolean functions. In addition, we analyze how differences in the underlying physics of individual gates within a circuit influence the minimal thermodynamic cost of the circuit as a whole. These results lay the foundation for extending circuit complexity theory to include mismatch cost as a resource cost.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.</p>

            <p>The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the atomic lattice and its interaction with the electronic band structure that facilitate charge ordering. However, CDWs are rarely observed in presence of Kondo screening and heavy fermion quasiparticles. The heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe$_2$. This allows for a refined identification of the nesting wavevectors in the electronic bandstructure. Although these wavevectors have no specific influence on the bulk properties, for example on antiferromagnetic fluctuations, they cause the interactions leading to the CDW at the surface. The heavy fermion hybridization pattern is spatially modulated specifically at the nesting wavevectors, suggesting that surface induced modifications in the U 5f electron valence enable a novel form of purely electron-driven charge ordering.</p>

Our results shed light on the origin and nature of phonon magnetism and suggest the existence of phononomagnetic hidden order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Sorkin, Thomas A. Witten</p>
            <p>Two remote agents with synchronized clocks may use them to act in concert and communicate. This necessitates some means of creating and maintaining synchrony. One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is to expose them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This "noise-induced synchronization" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' relative phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. First, although the relative phases of the two clocks varied erratically, we confirm that they became statistically independent of initial conditions and hence equivalent after a well-defined timescale. Second, we show that an agent can estimate an effective phase that closely agrees with the other's phase. Thus, synchronization is practically attainable beyond the regime of conventional noise-induced synchronization. We finally discuss how it might be used in living systems.</p>

            <h2>Pairing mechanism and superconductivity in pressurized La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming Zhang, Cui-Qun Chen, Dao-Xin Yao, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with critical temperature $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has sparked a surge of exploration of high-$T_c$ superconductors in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates. More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</p>

            <p>The epitaxial synthesis of high-quality 2D layered materials is an essential driver of both fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a prototypical 2D layered topological insulator, is sensitive to defects imparted during the growth, either thermodynamically or due to the film-substrate interaction. In this study, it is shown that step-terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates with a high miscut angle (3°) can effectively suppress a particular hard-to-mitigate defect, the antiphase twin. Systematic investigations across a range of growth temperatures and substrate miscut angles confirm that atomic step edges act as preferential nucleation sites, stabilizing a single twin domain. First-principles calculations suggest that there is a significant energy barrier for twin boundary formation at step edges, supporting the experimental observations. Detailed structural characterization indicates that this twin-selectivity is lost through the mechanism of the 2D layers overgrowing the step edges, leading to higher twin density as the thickness increases. These findings highlight the complex energy landscape unique to 2D materials that is driven by the interplay between substrate properties, nucleation dynamics, and defect formation, and overcoming and controlling these are critical to improve material quality for quantum and electronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Hall effect in topologically trivial isolated flat-band systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raigo Nagashima, Masao Ogata, Naoto Tsuji</p>
            <p>We study the Hall effect in topologically trivial isolated flat-band systems (i.e., flat bands are separated from other bands and have zero Chern number) for a weak magnetic field. In a naive semiclassical picture, the Hall conductivity vanishes when dispersive bands are unoccupied, since there are no mobile carriers. To go beyond the semiclassical picture, we establish a fully quantum mechanical gauge-invariant formula for the Hall conductivity that can be applied to any lattice models. We apply the formula to a general $N+M$-band model with $N$ dispersive bands and $M$-fold degenerate isolated flat bands, and find that when the dispersive bands are unoccupied, the total conductivity takes a universal form consisting of the energy difference between the dispersive and flat bands, and the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor of the flat bands, which can be nonzero in systems with vanishing Berry curvature. We numerically confirm the Hall effect for isolated flat-band lattice models on the honeycomb lattice ($N=M=1$) and two different Kagome lattices ($N=2$, $M=1$ and $N=1$, $M=2$).</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) metallic altermagnets present exciting opportunities for both fundamental research and practical innovations. Their ability to enhance tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions, combined with the direct control of spin currents via electric fields, makes them highly promising for spintronic devices. Moreover, the rich electronic structure of altermagnets can host nontrivial topological phases. In particular, topological crystalline insulators are compounds where the topological states are protected by both crystalline and time-reversal symmetries. Furthermore, manipulating the state of a system between topological and trivial phases through external parameters unlocks new possibilities for quantum materials and advanced electronics. We show the edge states of a 2D altermagnetic topological crystalline insulator, using as a representative example Cr$_2$BAl, a 2D MBene metallic altermagnet with a d$_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic ordering. We find that the system can host an altermagnetic phase with extremely large ``weak ferrimagnetism" which is sizeable also with light atoms, only with an in-plane component of the Néel vector. The electronic structure of Cr$_2$BAl presents multiple crossings and anti-crossings in the vicinity of the Fermi level along [100] and [010] directions. When the spin-orbit coupling interaction is included, with the Néel vector along [001] direction, energy gaps open at the band crossing points, resulting in a pronounced peak in the spin Hall conductivity. The simulated Cr-B terminated [100] edge-projected band structure reveals Dirac dispersions at the bulk crossings and anti-crossings, which are absent in Cr-Al terminations.</p>

            <p>Understanding thermal properties of materials is fundamental to technological applications and to discovering new phenomena. In particular, advances in experimental techniques such as cold-atom measurements allow the simulation of paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the behavior of the specific heat as a function of density. In this work, we perform Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model interpolating between the square and triangular lattices to analyze the specific heat as the filling, interaction, and temperature of the system are changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential contributions to the specific heat, demonstrating interesting phenomena away from the commonly studied half-filling regime. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atom experiments measurements at multiple temperatures. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign.</p>

            <p>We introduce a new class of tunable periodic structures, formed by launching two obliquely propagating surface acoustic waves on a piezoelectric substrate that supports a two-dimensional quantum material. The resulting acoustoelectric superlattice exhibits two salient features. First, its periodicity is widely tunable, spanning a length scale intermediate between moiré superlattices and optical lattices, enabling the formation of narrow, topologically nontrivial energy bands. Second, unlike moiré systems, where the superlattice amplitude is set by intrinsic interlayer tunneling and lattice relaxation, the amplitude of the acoustoelectric potential is externally tunable via the surface acoustic wave power. Using massive monolayer graphene as an example, we demonstrate that varying the frequencies and power of the surface acoustic waves enables in-situ control over the band structure of the 2D material, generating flat bands and nontrivial valley Chern numbers, featuring a highly localized Berry curvature.</p>

            <p>Understanding the transport properties of quantum many-body systems is a central challenge in condensed matter and statistical physics. Theoretical studies usually rely on two main approaches: Dynamics of linear-response functions in closed systems and boundary-driven dynamics governed by Markovian master equations for open systems. While the equivalence of their dynamical behavior has been explored in recent studies, a systematic comparison of the transport coefficients obtained from these two classes of approaches remains a largely open question. Here, we address this gap by comparing and contrasting the dc diffusion constant $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ according to the two approaches, focusing on the specific example of magnetization transport in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain. Using exact numerical simulations for finite system sizes, we find (i) a clear mismatch between the two $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ and (ii) a strong dependence of $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ on the system-bath coupling strength for the open system, where neither (i) nor (ii) tend to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. These findings suggest limitations of the open-system approach to transport coefficients. To gain insight into the origin of (i) and (ii), we go beyond $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ and analyze the full time dependence of the diffusion coefficient $D(t)$ in the open system. In this way, we find that both (i) and (ii) vanish up to a finite time scale. While this time scale gradually increases with system size and tends to be macroscopic in the thermodynamic limit, this increase is still slow compared to the increase of the time to reach the steady state, where (i) and (ii) do not vanish. This observation can be seen as a wrong, yet unavoidable order of limits of long times first and large system sizes afterwards.</p>

            <p>Non-relativistic spin-splitting in unconventional antiferromagnets has garnered much attention for its promising spintronic applications and open fundamental questions. Here, we uncover a unique even-parity spin texture in chiral non-collinear antiferromagnets, exemplified using a kagome lattice. We consider two distinct types of electrons in the system: one with Schrödinger-like dispersion and the other exhibiting Dirac-like behavior. Remarkably, we show that, for both electron types, this spin texture induces an exotic coexistence of opposite-spin singlet and equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs with finite momentum when proximity-coupled to conventional superconductors. The triplet pairing arises from the intrinsic spin rotation of the antiferromagnet and does not require net magnetization or spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, we identify an unprecedented and tunable phase difference between singlet and triplet pairings, controllable through junction orientation. This mixed pairing state can be experimentally probed via damped oscillations in order parameters and 0-$\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions. Additionally, we analyze the effect of out-of-plane spin canting, elucidating its role in generating spin-polarized supercurrents, and discuss Mn$_3$Ga and Mn$_3$Ge to test our predictions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrique P. Cital, Viktor Holubec</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) provide fundamental constraints on the interplay between power fluctuations, entropy production, and efficiency in overdamped stationary autonomous heat engines. However, their validity in underdamped regimes remains limited and less explored. Here, we analytically and numerically study a physically realizable autonomous heat engine composed of two underdamped continuous degrees of freedom coupled to a two-level system. We show that this nonlinear setup can robustly violate TUR-based trade-offs by exploiting resonant coupling, effectively using one underdamped mode as an internal periodic drive. When this coupling is suppressed, the system recovers TUR-like bounds consistent with overdamped theory. Importantly, we demonstrate that the strongest suppression of current fluctuations occurs in a resonance regime that can be directly inferred from mean current measurements - a quantity typically much easier to access experimentally than fluctuations. Our results reveal new pathways to circumvent classical TUR constraints in underdamped systems and provide practical guidelines for designing efficient, precise microscopic engines and autonomous clocks.</p>

This observation motivates a model for the intermediate regime in which the ballistic central two-dimensional normal metal is treated as a continuum under the adiabatic approximation, while Andreev modes propagate in a background of voltage- and flux-tunable nonequilibrium electronic populations. The model predicts characteristic voltage scales that govern the mesoscopic oscillations of the critical current, and these scales are at the crossroads of interpreting experiments in all sectors of the MJJs: quartets, topology, and Floquet theory. Our model is specifically inspired by the recent Harvard and Penn State group experiments.</p>

            <h2>Follow the curvature of viscoelastic stress: Insights into the steady arrowhead structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre-Yves Goffin, Yves Dubief, Vincent E. Terrapon</p>
            <p>Focusing on simulated dilute polymer solutions, this letter investigates the interactions between flow structures and organized polymer stress sheets for the steady arrowhead coherent structure in a two-dimensional periodic channel flow. Formulating the problem in a frame of reference moving with the arrowhead velocity, streamlines, which are also pathlines in this frame, enables the identification of two distinct topological regions linked to two stagnation points. The streamlines help connecting the spatial distribution of polymer stress within the sheets and the dynamics of polymers transported by the flow. Using stresslines, lines parallel to the eigenvectors of polymer stress, a novel formulation of the viscoelastic stress term in the momentum transport equation proposes a more intuitive interpretation of the relation between the curvature of the stresslines, and the variation of stress along these lines, with the local flow topology. An approximation of this formulation is shown to explain the pressure jump observed in the arrowhead structure as a function of the local curvature of the polymer stress sheet.</p>

            <p>Interest in Josephson junctions (JJs) has increased rapidly in recent years not only because of their use in qubits and other quantum devices but also due to the unique physics supported by the JJs. The advent of various novel quantum materials for both the barrier region and the superconducting leads has led to the possibility of adding new functionalities to the JJs. Thus, there is a growing need for accurate modeling of the JJs and related systems to enable their predictive control and atomistic level understanding. This review presents an in-depth discussion of a Green's function-based formalism for computing supercurrents in JJs. The formulation is tailored for large-scale atomistic simulations and encompasses both dc and ac supercurrents. We hope that this review will provide a timely and comprehensive reference for researchers as well as beginning practitioners interested in Green's-function-based methods to model supercurrents in JJs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paweł Matus</p>
            <p>We develop a low-energy field theory for electrically charged crystals. Using the tools of fracton-elasticity duality, generalized to accommodate the magnetic 1-form symmetry of electromagnetism, we show how the elastic and electromagnetic degrees of freedom couple to the different crystal defects and to one another. The resulting field theory is then used to calculate vacancy-vacancy interaction energy, and to study the consequences of vacancy proliferation. We find that the longitudinal mode, which in a perfect crystal has a finite gap due to plasma oscillations, becomes gapless in the presence of vacancies. Our framework lays a foundation for a study of defect interactions, their collective dynamics, and consequences of defect-mediated melting in charged crystals.</p>

            <p>Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.</p>

            <h2>Cation vacancies mediate thermochemical water splitting with iron aluminates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan J. Szymanski, Kent J. Warren, Alan W. Weimer, Christopher J. Bartel</p>
            <p>Solar thermochemical water splitting enables hydrogen production by cycling metal oxides between reduced and oxidized states, typically through an oxygen vacancy mechanism. However, recent experimental work suggests that cation vacancies have a greater influence on the redox behavior of iron aluminate spinels used in water splitting. This remains debated, as calculations predict that such cation vacancies are thermodynamically unfavorable. In the current work, we show that Fe vacancies in (Fe$\zeta$Al1-$\zeta$)3O4 become accessible only when facilitated by inversion between Fe and Al. This antisite disorder lowers the formation energy of octahedral Fe vacancies in Al-rich spinels ($\zeta$ = 1/3) from over 3 eV to just 0.62 eV when one third of the cation sites are inverted, allowing high Fe vacancy concentrations under oxidizing conditions. This mechanism supports high H2 yields up to 361 $\mu$mol/g, consistent with experimental observations. Our findings support the notion that solar thermochemical water splitting can occur through a cation vacancy mechanism. They also clarify how site inversion, vacancy energetics, and defect interactions each contribute to redox performance, offering general design principles for identifying and optimizing materials that operate through cation vacancy cycling.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abrar Faiyad, Ashlie Martini</p>
            <p>Dopants can tune the performance of MoS2 in various applications, but use of molecular dynamics simulations for doped MoS2 materials discovery is limited by the lack of multi-dopant interatomic potentials. Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) could be a solution, but the accuracy of these potentials must first be evaluated. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of a recently developed MLIP, META's Universal Model for Atoms (UMA), for 25 different MoS2 dopants spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals in Mo substitution, S substitution, and intercalated positions by benchmarking the MLIP-predicted formation energy and the dopant-induced structural change against density functional theory calculations. The computational framework for MLIP validation and simulations are described in detail and the source code is made open source. The MLIP is then demonstrated by performing heating-cooling simulations of MoS2 supercells with all 25 dopants. These simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides a computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance.</p>

            <h2>Field-Induced SIT in Disordered 2D Electron systems: The case of amorphous Indium-Oxide thin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsofar Maniv, Vladimir Zhuravlev</p>
            <p>The phenomenon of field-induced superconductor to insulator transition (SIT) in disordered 2D electron systems has been a subject of controversy since its discovery in the early 1990s. Here we present a phenomenological quantitative theory of this phenomenon which is not based exclusively on the boson-vortex duality used commonly in the field. Within a new low-temperature framework of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) functional approach to superconducting fluctuations we propose and develop a scenario in which bosons of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) condense and localize in real-space mesoscopic puddles under increasing magnetic field due to diminishing stiffness of the fluctuation modes at low temperatures in a broad range of momentum space. Quantum tunneled CPFs relieving the condensed mesoscopic puddles, which consequently pair break into fermionic quasi-particle excitations, dominate the thermally activated inter-puddles transport. The spatially shrinking puddles of CPFs, embedded in expanding normal-state regions, upon further increasing field, suppress the quasi-particle excitation gap and so lead to high-field negative magneto-resistance (MR). Application to amorphous Indium-Oxide thin films shows good quantitative agreement with experimental sheet resistance data. In particular, in agreement with the experiment at low temperatures (i.e. well below the quantum tunneling pair breaking "temperature"), the sheet resistance isotherms are predicted to show a single crossing point at a quantum critical field not far below the MR peak.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shashank Gupta, Steven S.-L. Zhang</p>
            <p>Unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in metallic bilayers arises from nonlinear spin-charge transport mediated by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries, yet the role of magnons remains unsettled. We develop a theoretical framework that incorporates coupled electron-magnon dynamics, revealing cross diffusion and spin-angular-momentum transfer between the two subsystems, which renormalize the characteristic electron and magnon spin-diffusion lengths. We show that nonequilibrium magnons, indirectly excited by the electric field, can suppress UMR by absorbing spin angular momentum from conduction electrons. We also analyze the magnetic-field, thickness, and temperature dependencies and identify distinct features that constitute experimental fingerprints of magnonic contributions to UMR in metallic bilayers, providing qualitative to semiquantitative guidance for elucidating the underlying physical mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Osmotic forces modify lipid membrane fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amaresh Sahu</p>
            <p>In hydrodynamic descriptions of lipid bilayers, the membrane is often approximated as being impermeable to the surrounding, solute-containing fluid. However, biological and in vitro lipid membranes are influenced by their permeability and the resultant osmotic forces -- whose effects remain poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of a fluctuating, planar lipid membrane that is ideally selective: fluid can pass through it, while the electrically-neutral solutes cannot. We find that the canonical membrane relaxation mode, in which internal membrane forces are balanced by fluid drag, no longer exists over all wavenumbers. Rather, this mode only exists when it is slower than solute diffusion -- corresponding to a finite range of wavenumbers. The well-known equipartition result quantifying the size of membrane undulations due to thermal perturbations is consequently limited in its validity to the aforementioned range. Moreover, this range shrinks as the membrane surface tension is increased, and above a critical tension the membrane mode vanishes. Our findings are relevant when interpreting experimental measurements of membrane fluctuations, especially in vesicles at moderate to high tensions.</p>

            <p>Efficient numerical routines are developed for numerical studies of the dependence of the equilibrium magnetic states, excitations, and microwave power absorption on temperature and composition in transition-metal/rare-earth ferrites, including the reversal of the Néel vector occurring on both temperature and the concentration of the rare-earth atoms. It results in a drastic change in the behavior at the magnetization and angular-momentum compensation points. Dominant uniform oscillation modes are obtained by computing the magnetization correlation function. They are compared with the analytical solution, which is analyzed in detail. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is used to compute the frequency dependence of the absorbed microwave power. A good agreement with analytical results is demonstrated. Disorder caused by random positions of rare-earth atoms in a diluted RE system leads to multiple localized modes that converge into broad absorption maxima as the size of the system increases. The power absorption integrated over frequency exhibits a minimum at the compensation point.</p>

            <p>The Landau-Brazovskii model provides a theoretical framework for describing various phases arising from competing short- and long-range interactions in many physical systems. In this work, we investigate phase transitions among various ordered phases within the three-dimensional Landau-Brazovskii model. We construct the phase diagram of this model, which encompasses eight distinct phases, and systematically compute the transition pathways connecting various metastable and stable states using the Landau-Brazovskii saddle dynamics. Along each transition pathway, the critical nucleus is identified with some detailed analyses of its shape, energy barrier, and Hessian eigenvalues. Furthermore, we explore how the transition state is influenced by model parameters, revealing systematic trends in critical nucleus sizes and energy barrier heights. Our results provide a comprehensive characterization of the nucleation mechanisms within the Landau-Brazovskii model and offer valuable insights into the structural transformations of modulated-phase systems.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Poisson: First-Passage Asymptotics of Renewal Shot Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julien Brémont</p>
            <p>The first-passage time (FPT) of a stochastic signal to a threshold is a fundamental observable across physics, biology, and finance. While renewal shot noise is a canonical model for such signals, analytical results for its FPT have remained confined to the Poisson (Markovian) case, despite the prevalence of non-Poisson arrival statistics in applications from neuronal spiking to gene expression. We break this long-standing barrier by deriving the first universal asymptotic formula for the mean FPT $\langle T_b \rangle$ to reach level $b$ for renewal shot noise with general arrival statistics and exponential marks. Our central result is a closed-form expression that reveals precisely how general inter-arrival statistics impact the naive Arrhenius law. We show that the short-time behavior of the interarrival distribution dictates universal scaling corrections, ranging from stretched-exponential to algebraic, that can dramatically accelerate threshold crossing. Furthermore, we show analytically and confirm numerically that the full FPT distribution becomes exponential at large thresholds, implying that $\langle T_b \rangle$ provides a complete asymptotic characterization. Our work, enabled by a novel exact solution for the moments of the noise, establishes a general framework for analyzing extreme events in non-Markovian systems with relaxation.</p>

This study establishes universal design principles through atomistic simulations of 32 amorphous Li-M-X systems (M = B, Al, Si, P; X = F, Cl, Br, I, O, S, Se, N). We identify four structure types governed by a rule that saturated M-X groups with more negative charges preferentially form M-X-M chains, identify paddle-wheel and cooperative migration as two favorable transport mechanisms that are significantly enhanced in amorphous structures. We also pinpoint Oxides and fluorides as optimal for electrochemical and hydrolytic stability, and reveal bulk modulus as a simple predictor for $Li^+$ mobility. These insights are integrated into a practical design diagram, providing a novel and valuable framework for advancing high-performance amorphous SSEs.</p>

            <p>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide(TMD) NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, conflicting conclusions were reported regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study core-levels and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy(SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy(XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ Resonant-PES to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The Ni $3d$ on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states(DOS) and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge-transfer (CT) cluster model calculations using the experimental $U_{dd}$, and it shows that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative CT energy $\Delta$. A comparative analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated CT insulator character, with a larger $U_{dd}$ and positive $\Delta$. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$<$NiO, and shows that $T_{eg}$ is not responsible for reducing $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO. The negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$ leads to the increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron. However, importantly, since $U_{dd}$$>$$|\Delta|$, a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ results in pushing $d$-states away from Fermi level and this is required to make NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated Dirac semi-metal with band inversion in the $p$-$p$ type lowest energy excitations.</p>

However, the Co $3d$-bands in CoTe$_2$ do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO. We address this conundrum by studying the electronic structure of CoTe$_2$ using hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Resonant-PES. We quantify the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band Resonant-PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV for CoTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level Co $2p$ PES and $L$-edge XAS spectra of CoTe\textsubscript{2} and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe\textsubscript{2}, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$<$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe\textsubscript{2} is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$>$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$$p$ type lowest energy excitations. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in the correlated metal CoTe$_2$.</p>

The ARPES-measured Fermi surface (FS) maps of Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_2$ show two hexagonal and one circular hole-like FSs around $\Gamma$, which matches well with the triple-\textbf{Q} state by taking into account the contribution of nesting vectors occurring between Co 3$d$ and Ta 5$d$ orbitals. In the case of Co$_{0.340}$TaS$_2$, a new electron pocket around K appears and the FS geometry changes as a result of the correlation effect of Co$_4$S$_{18}$ tripods forming in the system. The magnetic susceptibility calculations based on the charge-self-consistent DFT+DMFT band structures and the random phase approximation indicate that the most stable magnetic ordering vector (1/2,0,0) split into (1/6,0,0) and (1/2,0,0), which is consistent with the magnetic phase transition around $x$=1/3 in Co$_{x}$TaS$_2$.</p>

The interplay of repulsive interactions and photo-assisted hopping of electrons gives rise to a rich magnetic phase diagram featuring an antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition prior to a Floquet Lifshitz transition. Close to the antiferromagnetic transition, topological $d+id$-wave superconductivity prevails in the phase diagram for a wide range of drive parameters. At intermediate-to-high frequency driving near the Floquet Lifshitz transition, superconducting orders are tuned from spin-singlet $d$-wave to spin-triplet $p$-wave character, providing an effective protocol for Floquet engineering topological superconductivity.</p>

Analysis of these data identifies three possible mechanisms responsible for the enhanced Berry curvature driving the observed topological Hall effect. Below and above $T_{\rm N}$, Weyl states are the main sources of large momentum-space Berry curvature, though their formation mechanisms differ in these two temperature ranges. Below $T_{\rm N}$, breaking of $C_{3}$ symmetry generates Dirac points that split into Weyl nodes in applied magnetic field, whereas above $T_{\rm N}$, strong spin fluctuations can induce Weyl states. The third contribution, which occurs below $T_{\rm N}$, arises from scalar spin chirality developing within antiferromagnetic domain walls, which generates a real-space Berry curvature.</p>

            <p>We derive the phase diagram of the one-dimensional three-state Potts model with an additional mean-field interaction in the canonical ensemble. The free energy is obtained by mapping the model onto the spin-$1$ Blume-Emery-Griffiths model and solving it by using an Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation combined with the transfer matrix method. A complex structure with lines of first-order transitions, two triple points and a critical point appears at finite temperature. The phase diagram is two-dimensional, since there are two adjustable parameters, the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ and the temperature $T$. We show that the phase diagram does not present second-order phase transition lines, due to the fact that the order parameter is not a symmetry-breaking one. Quite remarkably, we are able to determine analytically one of the first-order phase-transition lines. We also prove that, when the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ is large and negative, the first-order transition temperature becomes asymptotically independent of $K$.</p>

            <p>The first hitting times of a stochastic process, i.e., the first time a process reaches a particular level, are of significant interest across various scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and economics. We modify the standard setup by allowing the target to spontaneously switch between two states, either active or inactive, and investigate the distribution of first hitting times accrued while the target is active. For this setup, we provide closed formulas for the distribution of the first hitting time. Additionally, we can introduce stochastic resetting to the underlying process and, utilizing our results, derive the formulas for the first time the active target is hit by the process under stochastic resetting. Interestingly, we show that resetting in this setup still leaves some memory; the system is no longer Markovian, which prevents a straightforward application of standard techniques.

Using a general tight-binding framework applied to multiple periodic systems, we establish the criteria for the emergence of Klein tunneling based on the conservation of an effective reduced pseudospin. The inclusion of higher-order terms in the wave vector leads to nontrivial matching conditions for wave scattering at interfaces. We further examine the emergence of multiple types of Klein tunneling in two-dimensional materials beyond graphene, including phosphorene and borophene, as well as in one-dimensional systems such as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. Finally, we discuss how these tunneling phenomena can be tested in both synthesized and artificial lattices, including elastic metamaterials, optical, photonic, phononic, and superconducting platforms, demonstrating the universality of Klein tunneling across different wave natures and length scales.</p>

            <h2>Fast and Slow Sound Excitations in Nematic Aerogel in superfluid 3He</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.M. Bratkovsky</p>
            <p>Nematic aerogel (nAG) supports so-called polar phase in liquid 3He. The experiments by [Dmitriev et al, JETP Lett. 112, 780 (2020)] showed that the onset of polar phase inside the nAG is accompanied by emergence of a sound wave with frequency quickly growing with cooling down from transition temperature and reaching a plateau. To describe this behavior, we start by calculating the elastic properties of the dry nematic AG that appear to depend only on Young's modulus of the parent material (e.g. mullite), the volume fraction of the solid phase and the aspect ratio of the representative volume of nAG. The elastic constants are then used to solve elasto-hydrodynamic equations for various sound vibrations of nAG filled with 3He. The (isotropic) first sound and anisotropic second sound in the polar phase are strongly hybridized with fourth sound and standard elastic modes in nAG. The hybrid second and the transverse fourth sound start with zero velocity at the transition, similar to pure 3He, and quickly grow with lowering temperature until they hit the sample finite size cutoff.</p>

            <p>The magnetic structure of EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$, in which magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions form a diamond network, was investigated using neutron and resonant X-ray diffraction on powder and single-crystal samples. The propagation vector was determined to be $\textbf{\textit{q}}_{\rm m}=(1,0,0)$~r.l.u. from these diffraction measurements. All possible magnetic structures in the space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ with this propagation vector were examined using the irreducible representation method and magnetic space group analysis. This magnetic structure was identified as a collinear antiferromagnetic structure with the magnetic space group $P_Inna$ (\#52.320) or $P_Inn2$ (\#34.164) under zero magnetic field. In these magnetic structure, frustration arises from competing magnetic interactions on the diamond network. These findings provide a concrete experimental reference for assessing the role of competing interactions in diamond-network magnets and motivate further studies of interaction-driven quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Janus MoSSe/WSSe Heterobilayers as Selective Photocatalysts for Water Splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mostafa Torkashvand, Saeedeh Sarabadani Tafreshi, Caterina Cocchi, Surender Kumar</p>
            <p>Identifying materials that simultaneously straddle the water redox potentials and possess an intrinsic electric field is crucial for achieving high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, including a range-separated hybrid functional and spin-orbit coupling, we investigate MoXY/WXY (X, Y = S, Se) Janus bilayers for overall water splitting. We find a critical competition between the metal-to-metal chemical potential difference and the intrinsic dipoles at the interface between the Janus monolayers. We find that the Se-Se interfaced heterobilayer is intrinsically capable of driving water splitting, while its S-S counterpart can meet the redox requirements through pH modulation. For both configurations, a remarkable STH efficiency of 17.1% is anticipated. Furthermore, we predict a threshold of 1.0 eV for the built-in potential gradient to govern the transition from overall water splitting to band-edge pinning. Compared to homobilayers, heterobilayers benefit from the reciprocity between layer-specific dipoles and the Mo/W chemical potential difference, which promotes spatial separation and suppresses recombination, overall enhancing hydrogen production. Our results establish specific electronic descriptors for Janus heterostructures, providing a rational design rule for maximizing solar-driven hydrogen production in asymmetric two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <h2>Non-zero Momentum Implies Long-Range Entanglement When Translation Symmetry is Broken in 1D</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amanda Gatto Lamas, Taylor L. Hughes</p>
            <p>A result by Gioia and Wang [Phys Rev X 12, 031007 (2022)] showed that translationally symmetric states having nonzero momentum are necessarily long range entangled (LRE). Here, we consider the question: can a notion of momentum for non-translation symmetric states directly encode the nature of their entanglement, as it does for translation symmetric states? We show the answer is affirmative for 1D systems, while higher dimensional extensions and topologically ordered systems require further work. While Gioia and Wang's result applies to states connected via finite depth quantum circuits to a translation symmetric state, it is often impractical to find such a circuit to determine the nature of the entanglement of states that break translation symmetry. Here, instead of translation eigenstates, we focus on the many-body momentum distribution and the expectation value of the translation operator in many-body states of systems having broken translation symmetry. We show that in the continuum limit the magnitude of the expectation value of the translation operator $|<T>|$ necessarily goes to $1$ for delocalized states, a proxy for LRE states in 1D systems. This result can be seen as a momentum-space version of Resta's formula for the localization length. We investigate how accurate our results are in different lattice models with and without well-defined continuum limits. To that end, we introduce two models: a deterministic version of the random dimer model, illustrating the role of the thermodynamic and continuum limits for our result at a lattice level, and a simplified version of the Aubry-Andre model, with commensurate hopping for both momentum and position space. Finally, we use the random dimer model as a test case for the accuracy of $|<T>|$ as a localization (and thus entanglement) probe for 1D periodic lattice models without a well-defined continuum limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Shou, Jeet Shah, Matthew Lerner-Brecher, Amol Aggarwal, Alexei Borodin, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $\alpha$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $\alpha=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($\alpha<3$) to a columnar ordered state ($\alpha>3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $\xi\propto1/|\alpha-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.</p>

            <p>Polarization analysis in x-ray spectroscopy provides an orientation dependent sensitivity to local bonding environments. For a cluster of atoms, polarization sensitivity is most often discussed through the lens of point group symmetries. However, this is a discrete, qualitative method of classifying clusters, and it does little to indicate the degree of spectral anisotropy. Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF. We find that the model can strongly predict the degree of spectral anisotropy, with the primary factors being derived from the spatial moments of ligands in a cluster.</p>

            <h2>Fooling the Landauer bound with a demon biased thermal bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salambô Dago, Ludovic Bellon</p>
            <p>The Landauer principle establishes a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of the erasure of a one-bit memory in thermal equilibrium. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how this bound can be effectively circumvented by introducing a hysteresis in the feedback-generated virtual potential of a micro-resonator acting as the information bit. By tuning the hysteresis, we engineer a non-equilibrium steady state with an adjustable effective temperature, enabling erasure processes that consume over 20 percents below the Landauer bound. Our results reveal that the hysteresis acts as an embedded Maxwell demon, exploiting temporal and spatial information to reduce the system's entropy and the thermodynamic transformation cost. This approach provides a versatile platform for exploring the interplay between feedback, information, and energy in stochastic systems.</p>

            <h2>The Sokoban Random Walk: A Trapping Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prashant Singh, Eli Barkai, David A Kessler</p>
            <p>We study caging/trapping in Sokoban-type models, featuring a random walker moving through a disordered medium of obstacles and capable of pushing some obstacles blocking its path. In one-dimension, we allow the walker to push up to an arbitrary $N_{\rm P}$ number of obstacles. For $N_{\rm P}\gg 1$, we use large-deviation theory to show that the survival probability to remain uncaged exhibits crossover from an exponential decay with time at intermediate times to a stretched-exponential decay at long times, with an exponent $1/3$ independent of $N_{\rm P}$. The long-time exponent matches the Balagurov--Vaks--Donsker--Varadhan (BVDV) theory of the classical trapping problem, while the exponential decay is qualitatively distinct from the Rosenstock's intermediate-time theory for classical trapping. Similarly, in two dimensions, numerical simulations reveal that both the Sokoban model and its generalized version exhibit long-time stretched-exponential relaxation with exponent $1/2$, again consistent with the BVDV theory. Finally, in two dimensions, we find that the mean trap size is nonmonotonic in $\rho$: it is small at both low and high densities, but reaches a peak at a characteristic density $\rho_*$. We estimate $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ for the Sokoban model and $\rho_* \approx 0.675$ for the generalized Sokoban model.</p>

            <p>Geometry design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors. Topology optimization is one of the most powerful approaches used to determine structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of both low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingshan S. Du, Suvo Banik, Lehan Yao, Shuai Zhang, Subramanian K. R. S. Sankaranarayanan, James J. De Yoreo</p>
            <p>Phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of hexagonal ice (Ih) along [0001] sometimes shows a honeycomb-like pattern, often interpreted as individual oxygen columns in single crystals. Here, we show that this pattern commonly arises from intrinsic basal stacking faults instead. A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of $(\frac{2}{3} a_{1} + \frac{1}{3} a_{2})$, produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [111] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length. These findings highlight the defect tolerance of ice's molecular packing and clarify the structural relationships among hexagonal, stacking-disordered, and cubic ice phases. This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state.</p>

            <h2>Entropy Has No Direction: A Mirror-State Paradox Against Universal Monotonic Entropy Increase and a First-Principles Proof that Constraints Reshape the Entropy Distribution $P_{\infty}(S;λ)$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ting Peng</p>
            <p>We present a purely theoretical, self-contained argument that the Second Law of Thermodynamics cannot be a universal fundamental law in the form ``entropy does not decrease'' (whether asserted trajectory-wise or as a universal statistical principle) when the underlying microscopic dynamics are time-reversal invariant. The core is a mirror-state construction: for any microstate $A$ one constructs its time-reversed partner $B$ (momenta inverted). If a universal monotonicity statement is applied to both $A$ and $B$, it implies that $A$ is a local minimum of entropy at every moment, which forces entropy to be constant and destroys any entropic arrow of time. The consistent replacement is that entropy is a stochastic variable described by a probability distribution $P(S)$, whose shape depends on constraints and boundary conditions. We then prove from first principles that constraints necessarily reshape the long-time entropy distribution $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ by altering the invariant measure through changes in the Hamiltonian and/or the accessible phase space. A sharp criterion is given: in the microcanonical setting, the \emph{only} way $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda)$ can remain the same up to translation is when all accessible macrostate volumes are scaled by a common factor; otherwise the distribution changes structurally. Recent experimental work validates this framework: asymmetric constraints enable spontaneous low-entropy transitions, allowing systems to produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir. With both theoretical and experimental barriers overcome, practical devices based on constraint-reshaped entropy distributions become feasible, with profound implications for energy generation and the long-term sustainability of civilization.</p>

            <p>We examine the homological structure of the Barabasi-Albert model, focusing on the time evolution of $\Delta$-dimensional simplices and topological holes as functions of time $t$ and the attachment parameter $m$ (the number of edges added by each incoming node). Numerical simulations reveal a non-trivial topological transition (TT) in the $(\Delta, m)$ plane, marking a change from a topologically trivial regime to non-trivial topology. This transition signals the emergence of topological complexity in the model, where higher-order structures develop self-similarly across scales. Beyond this transition, the network exhibits self-similar topological growth, evidenced by a power-law decay in the increments of $\Delta$-simplices with $m$-dependent exponents. An analogous transition occurs in the Betti numbers, which display self-similar behavior near the TT and an arctangent dependence farther from it. Based on simulation data, we propose explicit scaling relations describing the behavior of both $\Delta$-simplices and Betti numbers near the TT. Overall, the analysis reveals a rich, gapful topological transition structure, where topological quantities exhibit discrete jumps at the transition point.</p>

            <p>We calculate the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model on a half-filled ladder lattice including the effect of finite on-site interactions. This shows that the rung-Mott insulator (RMI) phase persists to finite interaction strength, and we calculate the RMI-superfluid phase boundary in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the phases can still be distinguished using the number and parity variances, which are observables accessible in a quantum-gas microscope. Phases analogous to the RMI were found to exist in other quasi-1D lattice structures, with the lattice connectivity modifying the phase boundaries. This shows that the the presence of these phases is the result of states with one-dimensional structures being mapped onto higher dimensional systems, driven by the reduction of hopping rates along different directions.</p>

            <p>The transfer of information from one part of a quantum system to another is fundamental to the understanding and design of quantum information processing devices. In the realm of discrete systems such as spin chains, inhomogeneous networks have been engineered that allow for the perfect transfer of qubits from one end to the other. Here, by contrast, we investigate the perfect transfer of information in continuous systems, phrased in terms of wave propagation. A remarkable difference is found between systems that possess conformal invariance and those that do not. Systems in the first class enjoy perfect wave transfer (PWT), explicitly shown for one-particle excitations and anticipated in general. In the second class, those that exhibit PWT are characterized as solutions to an inverse spectral problem. As a concrete example, we demonstrate how to formulate and solve this problem for a prototypical class of bosonic theories, showing the importance of conformal invariance for these theories to enjoy PWT. Using bosonization, our continuum results extend to theories with interactions, broadening the scope of perfect information transfer to more general quantum systems.</p>

Our trial state is constructed using an adaptation of the bosonic Bogoliubov theory to the Fermi system, where the correlation structure of fermionic particles is incorporated by quasi-bosonic Bogoliubov transformations. In the latter, it is important to consider a modified zero-energy scattering equation that takes into account the presence of the Fermi sea, in the spirit of the Bethe-Goldstone equation.</p>

            <p>Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a modular qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.</p>

We explain this unexpected phenomenon using a simple multiplex network model with latent geometry: links that are most congruent with this geometry are the ones that persist across layers, amplifying the cross-layer triangle overlap. This result reveals a different dimension in which multilayer networks are radically distinct from their constituent layers.</p>

By extending to quasiprobability, we derive quantum fluctuation theorems for multipartite coherence and quantum correlations, presenting them in both integral and detailed forms. Our theoretical results are illustrated and verified using three-qubit examples, and feasible experimental verification protocols are proposed.

            <p>We report the synthesis of halogenated carbon atomic wires (halopolyynes) via pulsed laser ablation in liquid and their comprehensive Raman characterization. Using dichloromethane and dibromomethane-containing solutions, we produced polydisperse mixtures of monohalogenated (HC$_{2n}$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_{2n}$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=3-10). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled separation and analysis of these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectrometry confirmed their molecular structures. A possible formation mechanism is proposed, involving carbon chain polymerization and termination by hydrogen and halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy reveal that halogen terminations act as auxochromes through p-$\pi$ conjugation between their lone-pair electrons and the sp-carbon backbone, extending effective conjugation length. This interaction reduces bond length alternation and moderately redshifts vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement and vibrational anharmonicity consistent with carbyne-like materials. These findings expand the synthetic approaches for halogenated carbon atomic wires and establish halopolyynes as a platform for tailoring electronic and optical properties of sp-carbon wires.</p>

            <p>Quantum adiabatic dynamics is the crucial element of adiabatic quantum computing and quantum annealing. Shortcuts to adiabaticity enable acceleration of the computational time by suppressing unwanted non-adiabatic processes with designed classical fields. Here, we consider quantum state transfer in the Landau-Zener model, which exemplifies the key elements of quantum adiabatic dynamics. We argue that non-adiabatic transitions can be suppressed by autonomous quantum dynamics, which involves coupling the Landau-Zener qubit to a second quantum system. By tuning the coupling strength, the composite quantum dynamics can reduce the probability of unwanted processes by more than two orders of magnitude. This is a prime example of control where the quantum properties of the control fields are key for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity.</p>

In solid-state quantum registers such nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, entangled states are typically created using sequential, pairwise gates between the central electron and individual nuclear qubits. This sequential approach is slow and suffers from crosstalk errors. Here, we demonstrate a parallelized multi-qubit entangling gate to generate a four-qubit GHZ state using a room-temperature NV center in only 14.8 $\mu$s $-$ 10 times faster than using sequences of two-qubit gates and close to the fundamental limit set by the hyperfine coupling frequencies. Parallel three-qubit gates are also realized with all nuclear-qubit subsets. The entangled states are verified by measuring multiple quantum coherences. The four-qubit parallel gate has a fidelity of 0.92(4), whereas the sequential four-qubit gate fidelity is only 0.69(3). The approach is generalizable to other solid-state platforms, and it lays the foundation for scalable generation and control of entanglement in practical devices.</p>

            <h2>Magnon squeezing near a quantum critical point in a cavity-magnon-qubit system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Gen Li, Rong-Can Yang, Wei Xiong, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.</p>

            <h2>How to Build Anomalous (3+1)d Topological Quantum Field Theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arun Debray, Weicheng Ye, Matthew Yu</p>
            <p>We develop a systematic framework for constructing (3+1)-dimensional topological orders or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that realize specified anomalies of finite symmetries, as encountered in gauge theories with fermions or in fermionic lattice systems. Our approach generalizes the symmetry-extension construction to the fermionic setting, and is grounded in recent advances in the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. In this framework, symmetry-extension data of a supercohomology theory are translated into a fusion 2-category, on which the anomalous TQFT is built. Building on this machinery, we demonstrate explicit calculations for various symmetry groups and their associated anomalies, with the help of a hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups which we will detail in a planned sequel. Finally, we prove that all supercohomology anomalies can be realized by fermionic topological orders, whereas beyond-supercohomology anomalies cannot, resolving a question of Córdova--Ohmori for fermionic (3+1)d systems with finite symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Anomaly induced transport from symmetry breaking in holography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashis Tamang, Nishal Rai, Karl Landsteiner, Eugenio Megias</p>
            <p>We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.</p>

            <p>We present a game-theoretic statistical framework for cosmology, which we term \textit{Cosmological Teleodynamics}. We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.</p>

            <p>The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ i.i.d. copies of any mixed quantum state into a uniform convex combination of $n$ i.i.d. copies of its purifications, has proved to be an extremely useful tool in quantum learning theory. Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.</p>

            <p>We describe combined experiments and simulations of droplet breakup during flow-driven interactions with a circular obstacle in a quasi-two-dimensional microfluidic chamber. Due to a lack of in-plane confinement, the droplets can also slip past the obstacle without breaking. Droplets are more likely to break when they have a higher flow velocity, larger size (relative to the obstacle radius R), smaller surface tension, and for head-on collisions with the obstacle. We also observe that droplet-obstacle collisions are more likely to result in breakup when the height of the sample chamber is increased. We define a nondimensional breakup number Bk ~ Ca, where Ca is the Capillary number, that accounts for changes in the likelihood of droplet break up with variations in these parameters. As Bk increases, we find in both experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of the deformable particle model that the behavior changes from droplets never breaking (Bk << 1) to always breaking for Bk >> 1, with a rapid change in the probability of droplet breakup near Bk = 1. We also find that Bk ~ S^(4/3), where S characterizes the symmetry of the collision, which implies that the minimum symmetry required for breakup is controlled by a characteristic distance h ~ R.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sichao Qu, Zixiong Yu, Erqian Dong, Min Yang, Nicholas X. Fang</p>
            <p>The mass law is a cornerstone in predicting sound transmission loss, yet it neglects the constraints of causal dispersion. Current causality-based theories, such as the Rozanov limit, are applicable only to one-port reflective absorbers. Here, we derive a universal sum rule governing causal scattering in acoustic systems, establishing a rigorous analogy to the Baldin sum rule in quantum field theory. This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kento Kasahara, Ryo Okabe, Chia-en A. Chang, Toshifumi mori, Nobuyuki Matubayasi</p>
            <p>We propose the integral-equation formalism of population dynamics (IEPDYN) to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The IEPDYN method is formulated in continuous time and therefore does not rely on a coarse-grained timescale (lag time). Consequently, kinetic quantities obtained from IEPDYN are free from lag-time dependence, which has been discussed as a limitation in other approaches. We apply the IEPDYN method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the IEPDYN method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the IEPDYN method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to complex binding and unbinding systems whose characteristic timescales are far beyond those directly accessible by brute-force MD simulations.</p>

            <p>As quantum devices scale to larger and larger sizes, a significant challenge emerges in scaling their coherent controls accordingly. Quantum cellular automata (QCAs) constitute a promising framework that bypasses this control problem: universal dynamics can be achieved using only a static qubit array and global control operations. Despite an extensive history of theoretical explorations and proposals, QCAs have not been experimentally explored in the context of highly-scalable globally-controlled systems. Here we realize QCAs on a dual-species Rydberg array of rubidium and cesium atoms, leveraging independent global control of each species to perform multiple quantum protocols. Seeding an automaton with different initial states, we explore many-body dynamics of quasiparticles and grow GHZ states across both species, highlighting the flexibility of our approach. We further develop a second automaton using a novel mediated entangling gate, enabling generation of 96.7(1.7)%-fidelity Bell states, 17-qubit cluster states, and high-connectivity graph states. Our results demonstrate that simple global controls enable access to a rich variety of applications through the QCA framework. The versatility and scalability of QCAs present compelling opportunities for the development of quantum information systems, as well as new perspectives on quantum many-body dynamics.</p>

The rapid computation of XANES based on molecular 3D structures constitutes a vital element of quantitative XANES analysis. Here, we present an XANES prediction model. It takes 3D structures as input and generates either unconvoluted XANES or convoluted spectra as output, demonstrating excellent generalizability across diverse instrumental broadening. This model has validated its predictive capability for both hard X-ray XAS (exemplified by K-edges of 3d 4d metals and lanthanides) and soft X-ray XAS (using S K-edge as examples). Adopting the model, XANES spectra of multiple elements can be predicted using a single unified model.

            <h2>Temperature as a Dynamically Maintained Steady State: Photonic Mechanisms, Maintenance Cost, and the Limits of the Infinite-Reservoir Idealization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Vaknin</p>
            <p>Classical thermodynamics treats temperature as a state variable characterizing systems in equilibrium with idealized infinite reservoirs. We argue that this framing, while computationally exact, obscures an essential physical reality: any system at finite characteristic energy $E_c = k_B T$ continuously emits thermal radiation and cools unless energy input compensates these losses. What thermodynamics calls ``thermal equilibrium'' is, at the microscopic level, a dynamically sustained steady state maintained by continuous photon exchange. We derive that the average photon energy required to sustain a Planck distribution is $\langle h\nu \rangle = \pi^4 E_c/[30\,\zeta(3)] \approx 2.701\,E_c$, quantifying the energetic throughput that any real system must sustain to maintain a given temperature. We resolve the apparent contradiction with the purely mechanical Maxwell velocity distribution: billiard-ball kinetics correctly describe the \emph{shape} of the distribution at a given $E_c$, but cannot account for how $E_c$ is established or maintained against radiative losses in any real system of charged particles. We further show that every finite thermal reservoir is itself maintained by photon exchange at a larger scale, organizing physical systems into a natural hierarchy from individual samples through cryostats, laboratories, and planetary surfaces to stellar interiors, with the classical infinite reservoir emerging as the large-capacity limit within that hierarchy rather than a fundamental physical entity. We also comment on the relation between thermodynamic entropy $S = k_B \ln W$ and the dimensionless entropy $\mathcal{S} = \ln W$, emphasizing that $k_B$ primarily fixes units (J/K) rather than introducing new statistical content. These results do not modify thermodynamics but provide its mechanistic interpretation in terms of quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ha Eum Kim, Andrew D. Kim, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>Quantum chaos is commonly assessed through probe-dependent signatures that need not coincide. Recently, a dissipative signature was proposed for chaotic Floquet systems, where infinitesimal bulk dissipation induces a non-zero constant intrinsic relaxation rate quantified by the Liouvillian gap. This raises a question: what minimal departure from Clifford dynamics is required to generate such intrinsic relaxation? To address this, we study a Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit doped with Haar-random single-qubit gates and subject to local dissipation of strength $\gamma$. We find a structure-dependent crossover. The undoped iSWAP-class circuit exhibits a weak-dissipation singularity, with a gap that grows with $N$ for any $\gamma>0$. Haar doping preserves this undoped-like growth for any subextensive doping pattern. At finite doping density, there exist patterns that yield an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ gap for any fixed $\gamma$ as $N\to\infty$, yet remain singular as $\gamma\to0^+$. Because our bounds depend only on the spatial doping pattern, they remain valid even when the Haar rotations are independently redrawn each Floquet period. Overall, our findings provide a circuit-level perspective on intrinsic relaxation, and thus irreversibility, in open many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Patramanis, Watse Sybesma</p>
            <p>In this work we study the relationship between quantum random walks on graphs and Krylov/spread complexity. We show that the latter's definition naturally emerges through a canonical method of reducing a graph to a chain, on which we can identify the usual Krylov structure. We use this identification to construct families of graphs corresponding to special classes of systems with known complexity features and conversely, to compute Krylov complexity for graphs of physical interest. The two main outcomes are the analytic computation of the Lanczos coefficients for the SYK model for an arbitrary number $q$ of interacting fermions and the complete characterization of Krylov complexity for the hypercube graph in any number of dimensions. The latter serves as the starting point for an in-depth comparison between Krylov and circuit complexities as they purportedly arise in the context of black holes. We find that while under certain conditions Krylov complexity follows the growth and saturation pattern ascribed to such systems, the timescale at which saturation happens can generally be shorter than what is predicted by random unitary circuits, due to the effects of quantum speed-ups commonly occurring when comparing quantum and classical random walks.</p>

            <p>We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) loaded into a one-dimensional optical cavity under the combined action of an external potential and atom-cavity coupling with mutually incommensurate periods. Such configuration enables the localization of matter waves even in the absence of two-body interactions. We study families of localized modes within the mean-field approximation for red and blue detunings from atomic and cavity resonances in relatively shallow quasiperiodic lattices, beyond the validity of the tight-binding approximation. The parameter regimes supporting localization of atomic wave packets are identified. The system exhibits two types of bistability manifested as distinct photon numbers under otherwise identical conditions. One type arises from the coexistence of multiple families of localized modes, typical of conservative nonlinear systems, while the other stems from the multivalued dependence of the families on system parameters, characteristic of systems exhibiting hysteresis. BEC in a cavity may also display pseudodegeneracy, understood as the existence of two distinct atomic-density distributions corresponding to the same atomic and photon numbers (although different chemical potentials). The stability of the localized modes is analyzed. It is shown that, owing to the strong impact of long-range interactions on stability, a two-localized-mode configuration can operate as an XOR logic gate.</p>

Even when workflows are successfully built, they are sometimes rigid and not adaptable to different use cases. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems offer a pathway to flexibly automate these processes and lower barriers to entry. Here, we introduce El Agente Sólido, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for automating solid-state quantum chemistry workflows using the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO simulation package.

            <p>The photochemical CO2 reduction reaction represents a zero-carbon pathway for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals, yet its industrial implementation has been constrained by low selectivity and product diversity. Dirac nodal arc semimetals characterized by ultrahigh carrier mobility with over 25000 cm2 V-1 s-1 offer a promising platform to search for efficient catalysts for CO2 conversion. Herein, we demonstrate that strategic Pt incorporation into PdSn4 optimizes the electronic structure and carrier dynamics of this Dirac semimetal. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the resulting Pd-Sn-Pt local electronic structure redistributes charge density around Pd and Pt atoms, which facilitates C-C coupling via *OC-COH and *OC-CHOH intermediates and enhances carrier mobility by 40% versus the pristine PdSn4 single crystal. The optimized Pd0.4Pt0.6Sn4 single crystal achieves C2H4 with formation rate of 0.000328 mol g-1 h-1, product selectivity of 73.1% and electron-based selectivity of 89%.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyue Liu, Tao Li</p>
            <p>Exact formulas for the optical conductivity and the Hall conductivity of the two dimensional Hubbard model are derived in terms of an effective theory description of the local moment fluctuation in the system. In this framework, the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the electromagnetic response of such a strongly correlated electron system becomes sign-problem-free in many physically relevant cases. In particular, it is sign-problem-free when we assume the widely used Millis-Monien-Pines form for the phenomenological susceptibility in the effective action of the fluctuating local moment, even though these local moments are now subjected to Landau damping as a result of their coupling to the itinerant quasiparticle on the fermi surface. This is true more generally when a $\varphi^{4}$ term is included in the effective action and is thus not restricted to the Gaussian limit. Here we demonstrate the power of this framework by studying the effect of thermal fluctuation of the local moment on the optical conductivity $\sigma^{xx}(\omega)$ and the Hall conductivity $\sigma^{xy}(\omega)$ of the cuprate superconductors. Both $\sigma^{xx}(\omega)$ and $\sigma^{xy}(\omega)$ calculated are found to exhibit a two-component structure, with a Drude component at low energy and a mid-infrared component at higher energy. Depending on the relative importance of the hole pocket and the electron pocket on the reconstructed fermi surface and the coupling strength to the local moment, the Drude component in $\mathrm{Im}\sigma^{xy}(\omega)$ can be either positive or negative.(full-length abstract can be found in the main text.)</p>

In one spatial dimension, numerical results are obtained for harmonic chains either in the ground state or at finite temperature, by considering, respectively, either a subsystem made by two adjacent or disjoint blocks on the line or a bipartition of the circle. The contour function of the logarithmic negativity diverges only at the entangling points, while the contour function for the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose is divergent also at the boundary of the bipartite subsystem, as functions of the position. In a two-dimensional conformal field theory, analytic expressions that describe these divergencies are discussed. In one spatial dimension, we explore the partial derivative of the logarithmic negativity of two adjacent intervals with respect to the logarithm of the harmonic ratio of their lengths while their ratio and the other parameters are kept fixed. Considering the ground state of the harmonic chain on the line and in the massive regime, we report numerical results showing that this quantity displays a monotonically decreasing behaviour.</p>

            <p>Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) governs lattice dynamics, charge transport, and collective electronic phases in quantum materials. In several families of unconventional superconductors, including transition-metal dichalcogenides and kagome metals, growing evidence points to a cooperative role of EPC and dynamic charge-density fluctuations (CDF) in stabilizing superconductivity. However, how the EPC strength evolves across phase diagrams and relates to superconducting properties in strongly correlated systems remains an open question. Here we investigate the interplay between phonons and the CDF recently identified in cuprate superconductors. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we track the dispersion and intensity of bond-stretching phonons in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ over wide ranges of doping, temperature, and momentum. We find that both the phonon softening at the CDF wave vector and the EPC strength, extracted from a pronounced phonon intensity anomaly, are maximized near $p = 0.19$, where superconducting properties are optimal and CDF intensity is strongest. These results identify dynamic charge-density fluctuations, rather than quasi-static charge density waves, as the dominant source of phonon renormalization in cuprates, and establish a direct correlation between EPC strength and the superconducting dome. More broadly, our measurements highlight EPC as a doping-dependent property of correlated materials, shaped by the electronic environment in which lattice vibrations are embedded.</p>

            <p>Understanding the fine structure of excitons is crucial for optoelectronic and quantum photonic applications of lead halide perovskites. It is demonstrated that polarization-sensitive photon echo spectroscopy in magnetic field provides a powerful method to access coherent exciton dynamics and reveal their energy level structure, which is hidden by inhomogeneous broadening. Exciton quantum beats observed in both Faraday and Voigt geometries offer a precise probe of the energy splittings among the four 1$s$ exciton states, enabling determination of the fine structure and bright-dark splittings. Application of this technique to bulk mixed halide perovskite crystals FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ reveals a bright-dark exciton splitting of $\Delta_\mathrm{X}=0.46~$meV, along with electron and hole Landé $g$ factors $g_\mathrm{e}=3.38$ and $g_\mathrm{h}=-1.14$, respectively. The quantum beats persist on timescales of 20--50$~$ps, demonstrating remarkably robust spin and optical coherences at cryogenic temperature of 2$~$K. The decay of the quantum beats of the outer doublet is governed by dephasing due to dispersion of the bright-dark splitting of $\sim0.06~$meV caused by localization potential fluctuations, while dephasing in the bright exciton inner doublet originates from a small zero field splitting of $\sim0.035~$meV due to anisotropic potentials.</p>

            <p>Topological active materials have emerged as powerful paradigm bridging the discovery of exotic topological phases of matter with the development of functional topological devices. The recent extension of these material systems into dynamic regime, where topological properties can be actively manipulated at ultrafast timescales, promises unprecedented control over topological states and their functionalities. However, translating the static topological lasing signals into high-performance logic functions remain highly challenging, which imposes a far more stringent set of materials attributes. Here, leveraging the strong nonlinearity and pronounced spectral isolation of perovskite exciton-polaritons embedded in a Dirac vortex microcavity, we experimentally demonstrate the dynamic topological Majorana-like state polariton condensation with its ultrafast logic operations at room temperature. By actively coordinating pump and control beams in both spectral and temporal domain, we dynamically steer the topological polariton condensation process and demonstrate AND and NOT logic operations, achieving record extinction ratio (~20 dB), extremely low control fluence (~0.2 nJ/cm2) and sub-picosecond response time (~500 fs). Our results expand the frontier of dynamic topology and establish a novel pathway towards robust, ultrafast, and reconfigurable on-chip polaritonic logic circuits.</p>

            <p>The ability to establish coherent communication channels is key for scaling up quantum devices. Here, we engineer interactions between distant polaritons, hybrid spin-photon excitations formed at different lumped-element superconducting resonators within a chip. The chip consists of several resonator pairs, slightly detuned in frequency to make them addressable, capacitively coupled within each pair and inductively coupled to a common readout line. They interact locally with samples of PTMr and Tripak$^{-}$ organic free radicals, deposited onto their inductors, which provide model $S = 1/2$, $g \simeq 2$ spin ensembles. Frequency-dependent microwave transmission experiments, performed at very low temperatures, measure polariton frequencies as a function of magnetic field in different scenarios. When only one resonator within a pair hosts a molecular sample, the results evidence that spins couple remotely to the empty LER as well as to the local cavity mode. If both resonators interact with a spin ensemble, the magnetic field tunes the polariton frequencies relative to each other, on account of the different spin-photon interactions at each LER. When polaritons are brought into mutual resonance, an avoided level crossing emerges that gives direct spectroscopic evidence for a coherent polariton-polariton interaction mediated by the circuit. Pump-probe experiments reveal that the excitation of a polariton within a connected pair is felt, thus it can be read out, by the other one. These observations, backed by model calculations, illustrate the control and detection of distant photon-photon and spin-spin correlations and entanglement in a scalable modular chip.</p>

            <h2>Correlated topological band structures of the kagome altermagnets Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge, Ga)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingying Cao, Yuanji Xu, Yi-feng Yang</p>
            <p>The interplay of topological band structures and electronic correlations may lead to novel quantum phenomena with potential applications. First-principles calculations are critical for guiding experimental discoveries and interpretations, but often fail if electronic correlations cannot be properly treated. Here we show that this issue occurs also in the kagome altermagnets Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge, Ga), which were believed to exhibit large anomalous Hall effect due to topological band structures with Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy. Our systematic investigations reveal critical importance of beyond-DFT treatments on three key aspects of their magnetic, electronic, and topological properties: (1) establishment of noncollinear altermagnetic orders, (2) weakly renormalized band structures in excellent agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment, and (3) sensitive tuning of the Weyl nodes. Our work provides a unified basis for understanding topological properties of the Mn$_3X$ family, which challenges previous experimental interpretations based on DFT band structures and predicts potentially higher anomalous Hall conductivity in Mn$_3$Ga under electron doping. This underscores the importance of a correlation-aware framework beyond DFT in understanding topological magnetic materials.</p>

Due to the magnetoelectric coupling, the transverse magnetic order of the indivual Cu2+ spins is accompanied by a characteristic dome-like electric polarization which is crucial for the observation of the condensate via the Faraday rotation effect.</p>

            <h2>Spin-dependent quasiparticle lifetimes in altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristoffer Leraand, Kristian Mæland, Asle Sudbø</p>
            <p>We investigate many-body effects on the spin-split electron bands in altermagnets by computing the electron self-energy arising from interactions with magnons, phonons, and hybridized magnon-phonon modes. These interactions lead to band broadening, which can obscure the intrinsic spin-splitting in spectroscopic measurements. We consider a $d$-wave Lieb lattice altermagnet as a representative example. Our results reveal that the spin-splitting remains spectroscopically resolvable and provide theoretical estimates of lifetime effects relevant for experimental detection. For electron-magnon coupling, we find a distinct difference between spectral function broadening for up and down spins close to the Fermi surface, which is not present in the case of electron-phonon coupling. We relate it to the spin splitting of the magnon modes in altermagnets. The results, including magneto-elastic coupling, are very similar to the pure magnon case. This provides insights into quasiparticle dynamics in altermagnets and contributes to the broader understanding of many-body interactions in spin-split systems. By including the temperature dependence of the self-energies, we also quantify how thermal fluctuations influence the broadening of the electronic states.</p>

            <p>LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) compounds crystallize in a tetragonal layered ThCr2Si2-type structure and belong to a family of low critical temperature superconductors. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations implemented in the CASTEP code, we systematically investigated their structural, mechanical, elastic, electronic, vibrational, thermophysical, and optical properties for the first time. The optimized structural parameters show good agreement with available experimental data. The Born stability criteria and negative formation energies confirm the mechanical and thermodynamic stability of these materials. Poisson and Pugh ratios indicate a ductile nature, while low Debye and melting temperatures together with low Vickers hardness suggest that the compounds are relatively soft. The electronic band structures and density of states reveal metallic behavior. Charge density distribution and Mulliken population analysis indicate mixed covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding. The calculated Fermi surfaces contain both hole-like and electron-like sheets, suggesting possible multiband characteristics. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms the dynamical stability of LaRh2Al2 and LaRh2Ga2, while LaRh2In2 shows dynamical instability associated with a possible structural phase transition. Optical property analysis indicates that these superconductors may be promising candidates for high-density optical data storage applications. The estimated electron-phonon coupling constant of about 0.56 indicates that LaRh2X2 compounds are weakly coupled low critical temperature superconductors.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets are metals with a momentum-dependent spin splitting of electron bands due to a specific crystal structure that is invariant under time reversal only in combination with rotations and reflections, or lacks time reversal altogether. The developed phenomenological approach allows one to obtain a spectrum of electron bands in an altermagnet corresponding to an antiferromagnet with the same symmetry. There are considered collinear antiferromagnets, weak ferromagnetic antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnetic structures. It is shown that only a weak ferromagnetic antiferromagnet has a nonzero Berry curvature.</p>

            <p>Recent experimental investigations have demonstrated that doping a semiconductor is a route to increase the thermal boundary conductance at metal/semiconductor interfaces. In this work, the influence of the electrical properties on heat transfer across metal/doped semiconductor junctions is investigated. Specifically, thermal boundary conductance at the interfaces between p- and n-doped silicon and titanium is measured by employing frequency-domain photothermal radiometry under varying external conditions. The influence of the doping level of the semiconductor, the barrier height, and the space charge area is analyzed. In particular, a 40% increase in the interface thermal conductance with the application of a current at n-doped silicon/titanium interfaces is reported. The enhancement of the thermal boundary conductance is explained by the shrinking of the surface charga area induced by the electric current. This study opens the way to modulating interfacial heat transfer at metal/semiconductor interfaces through fine tuning of electrical effects.</p>

            <h2>Magnetoelectric Raman Force on Shear Phonons in a Frustrated van der Waals Bilayer Magnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wolfram Brenig</p>
            <p>We show that the concept of coherent phonon generation by second order response to incident electric laser fields, which is a hallmark of pump-probe spectroscopy on conventional solids, can be expanded to include frustrated quantum magnets. For that purpose, we analyze the Raman force on the shear phonons of a frustrated magnetoelectric bilayer spin system. The bilayer is a stacked triangular magnet, motivated by recently emerging type-II van der Waals multiferroic transition metal dihalides and comprises a spin system which allows for incommensurate spiral order. The magnon excitations are treated by linear spin wave theory. In the spiral state, a finite electric polarization is obtained from the spin-current interaction which induces a coupling of the magnons to the electric field. Scattering of the bilayer shear phonons from the magnons is derived from a magnetoelastic energy. In this scenario, a mixed three-point response function for the Raman force is evaluated. We find it to be strongly anisotropic and very sensitive to the magnon lifetime.</p>

            <p>The spin-ladder compounds of the BaFe2X3 (X = chalcogen) family may be viewed as dimensional reductions (along stripe-like motifs) of the two-dimensional iron-based pnictide planes extensively studied since 2006. Remarkably, despite their reduced dimensionality, these materials retain the capacity for unconventional ground states, exemplified by the emergence of superconductivity in \bfse\ under applied pressure beyond 10 GPa, following a structural phase transition at 4 GPa. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation combining high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations, which together elucidate the true crystallographic nature of this pressure-induced superconducting phase. While X-ray diffraction alone reveals a symmetry lowering from the widely accepted orthorhombic Cmcm group to a monoclinic structure, it lacks sufficient sensitivity to resolve the precise space group. By integrating vibrational spectroscopy with density functional theory, we provide unambiguous evidence that the high-pressure phase is non-centrosymmetric, adopting the polar space group P2_1. These findings not only revise the structural assignment of \bfse\ in its superconducting state but also establish its non-centrosymmetric character (an essential ingredient for potential unconventional pairing mechanisms- thereby opening new perspectives on the interplay between lattice symmetry, dimensionality, and superconductivity in iron-based materials.</p>

            <p>We investigate the interplay between lattice symmetry, phonons, and magnetism in the quasi-one-dimensional ladder compound BaFe$_2$S$_3$ by combining polarized synchrotron infrared spectroscopy, hybrid-functional density functional theory calculations, and inelastic neutron scattering. Lattice-dynamics analysis reveals that the crystal symmetry is lower than previously proposed and is consistent with a $P1$ space group at low temperature. Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \approx 125$--$130$~K and the Néel temperature $T_N \approx 95$~K. First-principles calculations show that the modes affected at $T_S$ predominantly involve displacements that modulate magnetic exchange pathways. Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order. Our results indicate that short-range, dynamical magnetic correlations are sufficient to drive a static structural instability, providing a magnetically driven mechanism reminiscent of the iron-pnictide 122 family, yet realized here in a quasi-one-dimensional Mott system. These findings highlight the central role of magnetoelastic coupling in iron-based superconductors beyond the itinerant regime.</p>

Additionally, we experiment with modified architectures by making variants of Allegro some by adding strictly classical multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers and some by adding quantum-classical hybrid layers. We compare the results from QM9, rMD17-aspirin, rMD17-benzene and our own proprietary dataset consisting of copper and lithium atoms. As results, we have a list of variants that surpass the Allegro in accuracy and also results which demonstrate the trade-off with inference times.</p>

            <p>Pinning magnetization in a ferromagnetic thin film is commonly realized through exchange biasing with an adjacent antiferromagnet. Field-cooling from above the Néel temperature is a reliable yet slow re-pinning method in exchange-biased systems. For on-demand reprogrammable devices, localized and rapid exchange bias repinning methods are essential. Recent work has shown that femtosecond laser pulses enable field-free reversal of exchange bias in tailored multilayer stacks. Contrary to field-cooling, our experiments with ultrafast excitation reach hitherto unexplored regimes in the exchange bias setting process. Here, we unravel these observations by considering both ultrafast magnetization dynamics on the femto- to picosecond timescale and slow heat-driven dynamics on millisecond timescales and upwards. We develop a microscopic framework of exchange bias setting in a polycrystalline antiferromagnetic thin film like IrMn that provides a complete description of the observations in our present experiments and those found in literature. We expand the use of our model by identifying material platforms and stack designs that lead to optimized performance, aiding further development of optically reprogrammable devices.</p>

            <h2>Power attenuation in millimeter-wave and terahertz superconducting rectangular waveguides: linear response, TLS loss, and Higgs-mode nonlinearity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takayuki Kubo</p>
            <p>Superconducting waveguides are a promising platform for ultralow-loss transmission in the millimeter-wave to terahertz band under cryogenic conditions, with potential applications in astronomical instrumentation and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $\alpha$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\ell$ from the dirty limit $\ell\ll\xi_0$ to the clean limit $\ell\gg\xi_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $\alpha$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \gtrsim 0.5 \Delta/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\ell\gtrsim\xi_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $\alpha$ near $f\simeq \Delta/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity. This peak provides a distinct hallmark of the Higgs mode that has been largely overlooked so far.</p>

            <p>Nonequilibrium manipulation of quantum materials via electromagnetic dressing provides an on-demand route to tailoring electronic band structures through Floquet engineering. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy offers a direct means to probe these light-dressed electronic states. In such photoemission experiments, dressing can also occur for quasi-free electrons outside the material, giving rise to Volkov states. In certain cases, strong surface screening reduces the penetration of the driving field into the solid, resulting in Volkov contributions that dominate over Floquet ones. In this work, we systematically investigate the influence of materials' dielectric properties on Floquet-Volkov dressing of semiconductors, focusing on bulk layered van der Waals materials GeS, SnS, and 2H-WSe$_2$. First, by combining a simple model based on Fresnel equations with an electron-scattering description of Volkov amplitudes, we use polarization-dependent Volkov sideband intensities to extract a lower bound for the real part of the materials' dielectric functions, which typically lie between the reported dielectric constants for monolayer and bulk crystals. We demonstrate that increasing the fluence of the pump laser enables the generation of high-order Volkov sidebands which exhibit clear signatures of nonlinear light-matter interactions. Finally, we show that for our experimental geometry, the quasi-transparent nature of semiconductors in below-band-gap driving regime allows the optical pump to propagate within the sample and undergo multiple total internal reflections, producing temporally delayed Volkov replicas in pump-probe measurements via dressing of photoelectrons by evanescent fields. These systematic studies uncover previously unexplored aspects of Floquet-Volkov dressing in solids, highlighting the role of dielectric screening of the driving field.</p>

Unlike spin precession, the dipole relaxes toward a finite value away from the interface. We further quantify interfacial orbital memory loss and demonstrate that orbital absorption produces a sizable mechanical torque obtained from the orbital continuity equation.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interplay between magnetic ordering and light emission is crucial for developing magneto-optical technologies. However, this phenomenon is poorly understood since observations of this coupling vary significantly across materials. In this context, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) that incorporate Mn2+ ions are a chemically and structurally tunable platform for exploring this phenomenon, since they exhibit magnetic ordering and photoluminescence (PL) emission. Here, we study two antiferromagnetic Mn-based HOIPs with different organic cations that result in distinct lattice stiffness, Mn2+-Mn2+ distance and octahedral distortion. Temperature-dependent PL excitation spectroscopy reveals changes in crystal field splitting energy and Racah parameters well above the Néel temperature (TN), indicating the emergence of Mn2+-Mn2+ magnetic interactions prior to reach long-range magnetic ordering. These variations align with the observed changes in temperature-PL evolution. The compound with a more rigid lattice shows stronger changes closer to TN, suggesting combined effects of magnetic polarons and spin-canting. In contrast, magnetic polaron-induced magnetic modifications prevail in the HOIP with a softer lattice. These results reveal the complexity of the magneto-optical coupling in Mn-based HOIPs and provide new insights into this field extensible to other 2D materials that exhibit this phenomenon with potential for advanced magneto-optical applications.</p>

            <p>Moiré semiconductors built on angle-aligned transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers provide a physical realization of the Kondo lattice model, in which one TMD layer is prepared in a Mott insulating state supporting a lattice of local magnetic moments and the other layer in a metallic state supporting itinerant carriers. The artificial Kondo lattice enables the exploration of exotic states of matter near a continuously tunable Kondo breakdown. Here we report the emergence of a symmetry-broken Chern insulator at a moiré hole filling factor 4/3 in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which realize a chiral Kondo lattice. The symmetry-broken Chern insulator, which exhibits integer quantized Hall conductance at a fractional moiré filling, breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice spontaneously; it also appears only near a magnetic field-induced Kondo breakdown in the mixed-valence regime of the material. We further demonstrate that the magnetic field required to induce the Kondo breakdown and to stabilize the symmetry-broken Chern insulator is twist angle dependent. The results present new opportunities for exploring the subtle interplay between topology and Kondo interactions in moiré semiconductors.</p>

Realising the potential of machine learning techniques for liquid crystalline materials requires carefully curated data to be accessible, and on this basis we propose a simple and standard template for reporting data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Hartmann, Finja Tietjen, R. Matthias Geilhufe, Janet Anders</p>
            <p>Magnetization dynamics is commonly described by the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. On picosecond timescales, inertial and open-system extensions of the LLG equation are necessary to interpret recent experiments. We show analytically and numerically that the standard LLG equation exhibits strictly positive entropy production rates, while inertial and open-system LLG dynamics display temporarily negative entropy production rates indicating non-Markovianity. Here we quantify the degree of non-Markovianity using established measures. Our numerical calculations show that the open-system LLG equation consistently exhibits the highest magnitude of non-Markovianity for different initial conditions and magnetic field orientations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederik A. S. Philipsen, Mats Barkman, Andreas Kreisel, Brian M. Andersen</p>
            <p>We perform a theoretical investigation of the nature of vortices in chiral $d+id$ superconductors on the kagome lattice. The study is motivated by recent experimental developments reporting evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting state of kagome metals. Using self-consistent microscopic calculations that incorporate the characteristics of the band structure of the kagome lattice, we find that fractional vortices permeate the ground state condensate in the presence of an external field. Each fractional vortex carries one third of the superconducting flux quantum and exhibits a characteristic signature related to one of the three sublattice degrees of freedom of the kagome lattice. We discuss the relevance of these results to recent experimental studies of kagome superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field.</p>

            <p>We calculate the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model on a half-filled ladder lattice including the effect of finite on-site interactions. This shows that the rung-Mott insulator (RMI) phase persists to finite interaction strength, and we calculate the RMI-superfluid phase boundary in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the phases can still be distinguished using the number and parity variances, which are observables accessible in a quantum-gas microscope. Phases analogous to the RMI were found to exist in other quasi-1D lattice structures, with the lattice connectivity modifying the phase boundaries. This shows that the the presence of these phases is the result of states with one-dimensional structures being mapped onto higher dimensional systems, driven by the reduction of hopping rates along different directions.</p>

            <p>We propose a strategy to obtain conducting organic materials with fully spin-polarized Fermi surface, lying at a singular flat band, with antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic moments that reside in pi-orbitals of nanographenes. We consider a honeycomb crystal whose unit cell combines two different molecules with S=1/2: an Aza-3-Triangulene, a molecule with orbital degeneracy, and a 2-Triangulene. The analyzed system is half-metallic with a ferrimagnetic order, presenting a zero net total magnetic moment per unit cell. We combine density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard model Hamiltonian to compute the magnetic interactions, the bands, the intrinsic Anomalous Hall effect, and the collective spin excitations. We obtain very large intermolecular exchange couplings, in the range of 50 meV, which ensures room temperature stability. When the magnetization is off-plane, intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene opens up a topological gap that, despite being very small, leads to a quantized Hall conductance in the tens of mK range. Above 1 Kelvin, the system will behave like a half-metal with fully compensated magnetic moments, thereby combining two characteristics that make it ideal for spintronics applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Hawthorne, Leandro Seixas, James M. Almeida, Cristiano F. Woellner, Raphael M. Tromer</p>
            <p>The stability of chemically complex nanoparticles is governed by an immense configurational space arising from heterogeneous local atomic environments across surface and interior regions. Efficiently identifying low-energy configurations within this space remains a central challenge for first-principles-based materials discovery, particularly when the available reference data are limited. Here, we introduce a data-efficient and physically interpretable machine-learning framework based on a fragmented, layer-resolved descriptor that explicitly decomposes nanoparticles into surface, intermediate, and core environments using a topology-driven definition. This representation preserves a compact and fixed feature dimensionality while retaining spatial resolution, enabling controlled emphasis on different regions of the nanoparticle through physically motivated weighting schemes. Coupled with gradient-boosted decision tree models and a ranking-based learning strategy, the proposed framework enables accurate identification of the most stable nanoparticle configurations using only a few hundred density functional theory reference calculations. Ranking performance metrics demonstrate near-saturation of correlation, high top-k recall, and rapidly vanishing regret at moderate training-set sizes, highlighting the strong data efficiency of the approach. Beyond predictive performance, layer-weighting and SHAP-based interpretability analyses reveal how surface segregation, coordination topology, and local chemical disorder contribute differently to stability across spatial regions of the nanoparticle. These insights provide a transparent physical interpretation of the learned models and establish a natural pathway toward active learning-driven exploration of complex nanoparticle configurational spaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiuhe Yan, Tabitha C. Watson, Hongyi Xiao</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of a dense raft of millimeter-sized granular particles at a vertically vibrated air-water interface, which displays a rich set of patterns and particle dynamics as we vary the vibration amplitude, frequency, and particle packing fraction. While the classical parametric instability with standing waves still occurs over a certain parameter space, the measured wave dispersion relations indicate an increasing role in the raft's emerging elasticity at higher packing fractions, which induces a decrease in the effective surface tension and an increase in an out-of-plane bending modulus. At higher vibration frequencies and lower amplitudes, we also identified a regime without standing waves in which individual particles exhibit thermal-like motion and transition from diffusive to sub-diffusive transport as the packing fraction increases. Glassy behaviors such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity in particle dynamics occur as well, which is analogous to supercooled liquids. When the vibration amplitude is increased starting in this supercooled regime, a large cavity eventually forms inside the raft with its size and shape related to the vibration frequency and the injected vibration energy. The cavitation results in the coexistence of free surface water waves inside the cavity and thermal-like particle motion in the raft.</p>

            <p>Achieving controlled and directed motion of artificial nanoscale systems in three-dimensional fluid environments remains a key-challenge in active matter, primarily due to the prevailing thermal fluctuations that rapidly randomize the particle trajectories. While significant progress has been made with micrometer-sized particles, imparting sufficient mechanical energy, or self-propulsion, to nanometer-sized particles to overcome Brownian diffusion and enable controlled transport remains a major issue for emerging applications in nanoscience and nanomedicine. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating the fuel-free, reversible, and tunable active behavior of gold-silica (Au-SiO2) Janus nanoparticles (radius R=33 nm) induced by optical excitation. Using single particle tracking, we provide direct experimental evidence of self-thermophoresis, clearly distinguishing active motion from thermal noise. These light-driven Janus nanoparticles constitute a minimal yet robust photothermal system for investigating active matter and its manipulation at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>To advance the understanding of microstructural evolution behavior in Mg-rare earth alloys, the effect of yttrium (Y) addition on static recrystallization and grain growth in Mg alloys was systematically investigated in extruded Mg-1wt.%Y and Mg-7wt.%Y alloys. Y addition was found to significantly retard the microstructural evolution, primarily due to its solute drag effect arising from Y segregation at grain boundaries. The relative intensity of solute drag effects from different alloying elements in Mg alloys was further assessed from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, considering their grain boundary segregation tendencies and diffusivities. Additionally, static recrystallization in Mg-Y alloys was observed to proceed via a two-stage behavior characterized with two distinct JMAK exponents, indicating the heterogeneous nucleation of recrystallized grains. Abnormal grain growth (AGG) behavior was observed in these Mg-Y alloys. Overall, this study highlights the critical role of Y segregation at grain boundaries in controlling recrystallization and grain growth kinetics in Mg-Y alloys. This provides new insights into the design of thermally stable Mg alloys with refined microstructures.</p>

            <p>Polymer electrolytes are critical for safe, high-energy-density solid-state batteries, yet discovering candidates that balance high ionic conductivity with high transference numbers remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop a high-throughput screening platform that utilizes molecular dynamics simulations to navigate a chemical space of 1.7 million hypothetical polymer electrolyte candidates. Data from previous literature is used to warm-start batch Bayesian optimization for iteratively selecting new polymer electrolytes to evaluate. We iteratively identified, evaluated and analyzed 767 homopolymers as potential candidates. Our results reveal several candidates with transport properties exceeding the benchmark polyethylene oxide (PEO)/LiTFSI system. Crucially, our optimization campaigns for ionic conductivity and Li-diffusivity demonstrate that branched architectures and ketone functional groups significantly enhance ion-hopping mechanisms within the polymer matrix. We provide an in-depth mechanistic comparison of Li vs. Na cation transport and offer our open-source framework to accelerate the discovery of liquid, gel, and multi-cation electrolyte systems.</p>

            <p>Spectroscopic measurements of single-particle spectral functions provide crucial insight into strongly correlated quantum matter by resolving the energy and spatial structure of elementary excitations. Here we introduce a spectroscopic protocol for single-charge injection with simultaneous spatial and energy resolution in a Rydberg tweezer array, effectively emulating scanning tunneling microscopy. By combining this protocol with single-atom-resolved imaging, we go beyond conventional spectroscopy by not only measuring the single-particle spectral function but also directly imaging the microscopic structure of the excitations underlying spectral resonances in frustrated $tJ$ Hamiltonians. We reveal resonances associated with the formation of bound magnetic polarons -- composite quasiparticles consisting of a mobile hole bound to a magnon -- and directly extract their binding energy, spatial extent, and spin character. Finally, by exploiting the spatial tunability of our platform, we measure the local density of states across different lattice geometries. Our work establishes Rydberg tweezer arrays as a powerful platform for spectroscopic studies of strongly correlated models, offering microscopic control and direct real-space access to emergent quasiparticles in engineered quantum matter.</p>

We demonstrate this method for chemisorbed hydrogen on three fcc metal(111) surfaces: Al, Cu, and Pt. To validate the electronic coupling between adsorbed hydrogen and the metal surface, we compute the projected density of states, electronic tunnelling lifetimes, and vibrational lifetimes from the constructed Newns-Anderson Hamiltonians and find good agreement with reference calculations. Analysis of the chemisorption function reveals that the wideband limit approximation is valid for H/Al(111) but has limited applicability for H/Cu(111) and H/Pt(111).</p>

            <p>Critical quantum field theories occupy a central position in modern theoretical physics for their inherent universality stemming from long-range correlations. As an example, the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) describes a wealth of one-dimensional quantum systems at low temperatures. Its behavior is deeply rooted in the emergence of an effective Fermi sea, leading to power-law correlations and Friedel oscillations. A promising direction to realize systems exhibiting novel universal behavior beyond TLL is through the generalization of the underlying Fermi sea. In this Letter, we show that fractional Fermi seas with reduced occupancy arise in an integrable Bose gas driven out of equilibrium by cyclic changes in interactions from repulsive to attractive. The correlation functions feature signatures of criticality incompatible with a conventional TLL, suggesting a novel critical phase. Our predictions, based on Generalized Hydrodynamics, are directly relevant to cold atoms.</p>

The resulting excited yet stable Bose-gas states exhibit Friedel oscillations, smoking-gun signatures of the underlying FFS. The stabilization of these states offers an opportunity to deepen our understanding of quantum thermodynamics in the presence of exotic statistics and paves the way for applications in quantum information and sensing.</p>

            <p>Owing to the power-law anisotropy in the quasiparticle dispersion, yielding an enhanced density of states, the effects of long range Coulomb interaction get amplified in three-dimensional generalized Weyl semimetals, characterized by integer monopole charge $n>1$ of the underlying Weyl nodes. Using a Wilsonian renormalization group approach controlled by a large-$N$ expansion with $N$ as the number of Weyl fermion flavors and a gauge-consistent regularization fixed by the Ward-Takahashi identity, we uncover for $n\ge 2$ an extended interaction-dominated scaling regime with intrinsically anisotropic dynamic Coulomb screening, a finite fermionic anomalous dimension, and a power-law suppression of the quasiparticle residue, yielding an \emph{anisotropic} marginal non-Fermi liquid at intermediate energies. Ultimately, the effective fine structure constant flows to zero, albeit only logarithmically slowly, so the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology emerges as a broad crossover, controlled by a slowly running coupling. By contrast, for $n=1$ the system retains an isotropic marginal Weyl-liquid character. These predictions can be tested via scaling in thermodynamics (specific heat and compressibility), direction-dependent optical conductivity, and by anisotropic broadening of the single-particle spectral function in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>Relativistic equilibrium is described by the inverse-temperature four-vector $\beta^\mu = u^\mu/(k_B T_0)$ rather than by a frame-dependent scalar temperature. We show that $\beta^\mu$ can be reconstructed directly from electromagnetic fluctuations emitted by a drifting medium, without external probes, spectral lines, or absolute intensity calibration. A Lorentz boost converts isotropic rest-frame noise into correlated electric and magnetic fields, producing a gain-independent fluctuation observable that yields the drift velocity purely from stochastic data. Combined with angle-resolved noise spectra governed by the covariant fluctuation--dissipation theorem, this enables full reconstruction of $\beta^\mu$ using electromagnetic measurements alone. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates percent-level accuracy at realistic signal-to-noise ratios, and feasibility estimates indicate sub-microsecond integration times for laboratory plasmas. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first method that reconstructs the covariant thermal state $\beta^\mu$ of a relativistic medium from passive stochastic fields alone, without absolute calibration, spectral lines, or external probes. These results establish vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations as a direct operational probe of relativistic equilibrium.</p>

            <p>Mapping finite-temperature dynamical phase diagrams of quantum many-body models is a necessary step towards establishing a framework of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body universality. However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation.</p>

            <h2>Entropic Barriers and the Kinetic Suppression of Topological Defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Lin Tsao, Zhu-Xi Luo</p>
            <p>Many quantum phases, from topological orders to superfluids, are destabilized at finite temperature by the proliferation and motion of topological defects such as anyons or vortices. Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique spectral properties, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, often influenced by boundary conditions. The modulation of these phenomena by generalized boundary conditions remains unexplored and not understood. Here, we analyze the Hatano-Nelson model with generalized boundary conditions induced by complex hopping amplitudes at the boundary. Using similarity transformations, we determine the conditions yielding real energy spectra and skin effect, and identify the emergence of exceptional points where spectra transition from real to complex. We demonstrate that tuning the boundary hopping amplitudes precisely controls the non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of eigenmodes at the lattice edges. These findings reveal the sensitivity of spectral and localization properties to boundary conditions, providing a framework for engineering quantum lattice models with tailored spectral and localization features, with potential applications in quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the necessity to UV-regularise entanglement entropy, we present a spectral method for calculating the entropy of quasifree states, for both bosonic and fermionic field theories. This construction is defined in spacetime rather than on a hypersurface, enabling the covariant regularisation of entropies, and its calculation in generic spacetime regions. We derive these formulae, which have previously appeared in the literature, in a new manner and highlight certain aspects of them, such as their connection to the density matrix and its eigenvalues. The spacetime nature of the formulation makes it particularly apt in the context of semiclassical and quantum gravity and in connection to black hole entropy. Another useful property of the formulation is its application to settings where no notion of a Cauchy surface exists, such as in the causal set theory approach to quantum gravity. We show example applications of the formulae which demonstrate their ability to reproduce known results. We also show a calculation in a causal set in $1+1$ dimensions which makes use of several of the unique and useful features of the formalism. In this last example, we obtain a novel result of a slightly modified entanglement entropy scaling coefficient, giving a possible signature of spacetime discreteness.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debabrata Mondal, Lea F. Santos, S. Sinha</p>
            <p>Dissipation is commonly regarded as an obstacle to quantum control, as it induces decoherence and irreversibility. Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling.</p>

            <p>Plates generally admit six deformation modes: three of which are high in strain energy, stretch the plate's midsurface and are called membrane modes; and three are low-energy, bend the midsurface without stretching it and are called bending modes. For origami tessellations, and other corrugated compliant thin shells, the modes are mixed and it is no longer clear what modes, if any, are low in energy in the sense that they are inextensional. Here, it is shown, by direct construction of closed-form solutions, that when the midsurface is a surface of translation, there exists three infinitesimally inextensional deformation modes that correspond to (1) stretching, with an effective Poisson's effect; (2) bending, with an effective synclastic or anti-clastic effect; and to (3) twisting. The provided expressions are valid irrespective of surface regularity and, in particular, properly handle any creases be them straight or curved.

            <p>Recently, machine learning Hamiltonian (MLH) models have gained traction as fast approximations of electronic structures such as orbitals and electron densities, while also enabling direct evaluation of energies and forces from their predictions. However, despite their physical grounding, existing Hamiltonian models are evaluated mainly by reconstruction metrics, leaving it unclear how well they perform as energy-force predictors. We address this gap with a benchmark that computes energies and forces directly from predicted Hamiltonians. Within this framework, we propose QHFlow2, a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian model with an SO(2)-equivariant backbone and a two-stage edge update. QHFlow2 achieves $40\%$ lower Hamiltonian error than the previous best model with fewer parameters. Under direct evaluation on MD17/rMD17, it is the first Hamiltonian model to reach NequIP-level force accuracy while achieving up to $20\times$ lower energy MAE. On QH9, QHFlow2 reduces energy error by up to $20\times$ compared to MACE. Finally, we demonstrate that QHFlow2 exhibits consistent scaling behavior with respect to model capacity and data, and that improvements in Hamiltonian accuracy effectively translate into more accurate energy and force computations.</p>

            <h2>Overdamped limits for Langevin dynamics with position-dependent coefficients via $L^2$-hypocoercivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noé Blassel</p>
            <p>This note provides a simple derivation of the overdamped approximation for kinetic (or underdamped) equilibrium Langevin dynamics, in cases where certain coefficients depend on the position variable. The equivalent small-mass limit of these dynamics, known as the Kramers--Smoluchowski approximation, in the case of a state-dependent friction coefficient, has been previously studied by a variety of approaches. Our new approach uses hypocoercivity estimates, which may be of interest in their own right, and lead to a very direct derivation, providing in particular a clear explanation of the ``noise-induced drift'' term in the overdamped equation in the case of a state-dependent friction term. Using the same approach, we also treat several effective kinetic dynamical models derived from a coarse-graining approximation of a high-dimensional system, as well as a class of kinetic dynamics with position-dependent mass matrices. All of these models are relevant to applications in computational chemistry. We finally identify a mistake in a related work and suggest a solution.</p>

            <h2>Once-excited random walks on general trees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duy-Bao Le, Tuan-Minh Nguyen</p>
            <p>We study once-excited random walks on general trees, modeled by placing a single "cookie" at each vertex. Each cookie acts as a metaphorical reward that is consumed upon the first visit to the vertex where the cookie is placed. On that initial visit, the walk is in an excited state and behaves like a biased random walk. Once the cookie is consumed, the process reverts to a symmetric random walk on all subsequent visits. We consider a random environment in which the bias parameters are independent random variables. We prove that the process exhibits a sharp phase transition between transience and recurrence on general trees with polynomial growth, where the critical threshold is determined by the branching-ruin number of the tree.</p>

            <h2>Graphs are maximally expressive for higher-order interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago P. Peixoto, Leto Peel, Thilo Gross, Manlio De Domenico</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that graph-based models are fully capable of representing higher-order interactions, and have a long history of being used for precisely this purpose. This stands in contrast to a common claim in the recent literature on "higher-order networks" that graph-based representations are fundamentally limited to "pairwise" interactions, requiring hypergraph formulations to capture richer dependencies. We clarify this issue by emphasizing two frequently overlooked facts. First, graph-based models are not restricted to pairwise interactions, as they naturally accommodate interactions that depend simultaneously on multiple adjacent nodes. Second, hypergraph formulations are strict special cases of more general graph-based representations, as they impose additional constraints on the allowable interactions between adjacent elements rather than expanding the space of possibilities. We show that key phenomenology commonly attributed to hypergraphs -- such as abrupt transitions -- can, in general, be recovered exactly using graph models, even locally tree-like ones, and thus do not constitute a class of phenomena that is inherently contingent on hypergraphs models. Finally, we argue that the broad relevance of hypergraphs for applications that is sometimes claimed in the literature is not supported by evidence. Instead it is likely grounded in misconceptions that network models cannot accommodate multibody interactions or that certain phenomena can only be captured with hypergraphs. We argue that clearly distinguishing between multivariate interactions, parametrized by graphs, and the functions that define them enables a more unified and flexible foundation for modeling interacting systems.</p>

            <h2>Self-referenced, drift-tolerant dipole-resolved population inversion using degeneracy-lifted dual quasinormal modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Yu, Xinyu Zhang, Guangyu Dai, Shuai Xing, Minghui Yang, Fuxing Gu</p>
            <p>Photoluminescence intensity is widely used to infer exciton populations, yet the detected signal inherently convolves occupancy with radiative-rate modification and collection efficiency, making quantitative inversion vulnerable to pump and system drifts. Here we realize a dual-channel self-referenced scheme enabled by two nearly degenerate quasinormal modes in a hybrid microcavity. Their shared optical path provides common-mode observables (i.e., overall spectral and intensity drift) that track global thermo-optic and pump fluctuations, while their differential-mode observables (i.e., spectral splitting and mode-contrasted emission) remain highly sensitive to local gap dielectric perturbations and dipole-dependent radiative weights. Using temperature as a control parameter in monolayer WSe$ _2 $, we exploit this common/differential-mode framework to robustly invert the relative populations of excitons with out-of-plane ($ \perp $) and in-plane ($ \parallel $) dipole transitions without external absolute calibration. At the temperature of $\sim$50 K, we obtain $ N_\perp/N_\parallel \approx 200 $, coincident with the expected accumulation in the out-of-plane-emitting dark manifold. This internally referenced approach provides a practical route to drift-tolerant, dipole-resolved population metrology in nanogap photonic systems.</p>

            <h2>Mesoscopic Spin Coherence in a Disordered Dark Electron Spin Ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taewoong Yoon, Sangwon Oh, Junghyun Lee, Hyunyong Choi</p>
            <p>Harnessing dipolar spin environments as controllable quantum resources is a central challenge in solid-state quantum technologies. Here, we report the observation of a coherent mesoscopic spin state in a disordered ensemble of substitutional nitrogen (P1) centers in diamond. An iterative Hartmann-Hahn protocol transfers polarization from dense nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to a P1 ensemble, yielding a 740-fold enhancement over room-temperature thermal equilibrium as revealed by differential readout. The resulting mesoscopic P1 spin ensemble exhibits collective Rabi oscillations and long-lived spin-lock and Hahn-echo coherences. We identify a crossover in the saturation polarization arising from the competition between coherent driving and local disorder, providing a quantitative measure of the system's intrinsic disorder. These results establish a foundation for utilizing dark electron spin ensembles as robust resources for quantum sensing and quantum many-body simulation.</p>

We formulate sufficient conditions for a one-to-one correspondence between the stationary states with a fixed chemical potential and the set of bi-infinite sequences over a finite alphabet.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Langevin, Emma Bosbaty-Galliot, Emmanuel Centeno, Pauline Bennet, Rémi Carminati, Bodo D. Wilts, Patrick Bouchon, Antoine Moreau</p>
            <p>Diffuse scattering of light from disordered assemblies is traditionally viewed as an uncontrollable broadband scattering background resulting in whitish hues. Here, we demonstrate that correlated disorder enables precise engineering of light scattering from 2D arrays of emitters resulting in strong observable colors. Our analytical framework shows that introducing controlled noise, with tunable probability density functions and correlations, generates three distinct scattering components: diffraction orders, diffuse background, and correlation halos. Correlation halos, often mistaken for broadened diffraction peaks, are independent features whose positions depend on correlation range and can appear between Bragg peaks. Crucially, they persist far beyond the regime where diffraction orders vanish. The noise probability density function provides an additional control: specific diffraction orders can be selectively suppressed while preserving others. This approach reproduces the scattering signatures of natural photonic structures, e.g. found in Morpho butterflies, and reveals multiple pathways from order to disorder, each with distinct optical properties. Our work provides a practical method for inverse design -finding the disorder that produces desired scattering patterns. This establishes diffuse scattering as a designable quantity, expanding the toolkit for metasurfaces and structural color beyond periodic and hyperuniform structures.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional semiconductors have attracted considerable interest for integration into emerging quantum photonic networks. Strain engineering of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) enables the tuning of light-matter interactions and associated optoelectronic properties, and generates new functionalities, including the formation of quantum dots (QDs). Here, we combine spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence ($\mu$-PL) spectroscopy from cryogenic (4$\text{-}$94 K) to room temperature with micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature to investigate the strain-dependent emission energies of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS$_2$ and ML-WSe$_2$, integrated across multiple heterostructures and a piezoelectric device. Compared with delocalized excitons, QDs in both materials exhibit enhanced strain sensitivities of their emission energies $-$ approximately fourfold in WS$_2$ and twofold in WSe$_2$ $-$ leading to pronounced broadening of the ensemble emission linewidth. Temperature-dependent $\mu$-PL spectroscopy combined with dynamic strain tuning experiments further reveal that the enhanced strain sensitivity of individual QDs originates from strengthened interactions with low-energy phonons induced by quantum confinement. Our results demonstrate a versatile strain-engineering approach with potential for spectral matching across solid-state, atomic, and hybrid quantum photonic networks, and provide new insights into phonon-QD interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors.</p>

            <p>We have reproducibly grown near-single-domain superconducting aluminum (Al) films on GaAs(111)A wafers using molecular beam epitaxy. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed twin-domain ratios of 0.00005 and 0.0003 for 19.4-nm- and 9.6-nm-thick films, respectively-the lowest reported for Al on any substrate and long considered unattainable for practical device platforms. Azimuthal scans across off-normal Al{$11\bar{1}$} reflections exhibit narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) values down to $0.55^\circ$, unmatched by epi-Al grown by any other method. Normal scans showed a well-defined (111) orientation with pronounced Pendellösung fringes, and $\theta$-rocking-curve FWHM values down to $0.018^\circ$; the former indicates abrupt film-substrate and oxide-film interfaces. Electron backscatter diffraction mapping confirms macroscopic in-plane uniformity and the absence of $\Sigma$3 twin domains. Atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed atomically smooth surfaces and abrupt heterointerfaces. The films exhibit critical temperatures approaching bulk values, establishing a materials platform for scalable, high-coherence superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Peluso, Reinhold Egger, Andrea Nava</p>
            <p>The classical Mpemba effect is the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter water freezes faster than colder water due to the breakdown of Newton's law of cooling after a sudden temperature quench. The genuine nonequilibrium post-quench dynamics allows the system to evolve along effective shortcuts absent in the quasi-static regime. When the time needed for preparing the (classical or quantum) system in the hotter initial state is included, we encounter so-called Pontus-Mpemba effects. We here investigate multi-step Pontus-Mpemba protocols for open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by time-inhomogeneous Lindblad master equations. In the limit of infinitely many steps, one arrives at continuous Pontus-Mpemba protocols. We study the crossover between the quasi-static and the sudden-quench regime, showing the presence of dynamically generated shortcuts achieved for time-dependent dissipation rates. Time-dependent rates can also cause non-Markovian behavior, highlighting the existence of rich dynamical regimes accessible beyond the Markovian framework.</p>

            <p>We investigate autonomous dissipative charging mechanisms for lattice quantum batteries within the framework of open quantum systems. Focusing on engineered Markovian dissipation, we show that appropriately designed Lindblad jump operators can drive tight-binding systems into highly excited band-edge states, resulting in steady states with large ergotropy. We illustrate this mechanism in a one-dimensional tight-binding chain and in a two-dimensional graphene lattice. We find that disorder enhances the charging power, indicating that dissipation-assisted localization effects can be beneficial for energy storage. Moreover, the dissipative charging process remains robust against additional local dephasing noise. Our results establish bond dissipation as an effective and physically transparent mechanism for charging lattice quantum batteries in realistic open-system settings.</p>

            <p>We present g4chargeit, a kinetic Monte Carlo framework built on Geant4 for self-consistent simulation of time-dependent electrostatic charging in dielectric materials. The model explicitly incorporates stochastic particle transport and scattering processes using validated Geant4 cross-sections, while self-consistently evolving the electric potential and field. As a representative application, we simulate the charging of regolith grains under average dayside conditions on the Moon. The surface of the Moon, in addition to other airless planetary bodies, are regularly exposed to solar ultraviolet photons and solar-wind plasma, creating a radiation environment in which electrostatic interactions among regolith grains become significant. Until now, simulations of regolith charging have often relied on analytical approximations that oversimplify grain geometry and interaction mechanisms. Our Geant4-based simulations reveal charge accumulation within intergrain micro-cavities, leading to repulsive electrostatic forces consistent with experimental observations. The framework establishes a multiscale approach that links microscopic scattering events to the continuity equation of surface charge density and to the formation of macroscopic surface charge patches in complex grain geometries. Although demonstrated here for planetary regolith, the method is general and applicable to a broad range of dielectric charging problems. The code is openly available at this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik Fitzner, Francesco Carnazza, Federico Carollo, Igor Lesanovsky</p>
            <p>The characterization of collective behavior and nonequilibrium phase transitions in quantum systems is typically rooted in the analysis of suitable system observables, so-called order parameters. These observables might not be known a priori, but they may in principle be identified through analyzing the quantum state of the system. Experimentally, this can be particularly demanding as estimating quantum states and expectation values of quantum observables requires a large number of projective measurements. However, open quantum systems can be probed in situ by monitoring their output, e.g. via heterodyne-detection or photon-counting experiments, which provide space-time resolved information about their dynamics. Building on this, we present a machine-learning approach to detect nonequilibrium phase transitions from the measurement time-records of continuously-monitored quantum systems. We benchmark our method using the quantum contact process, a model featuring an absorbing-state phase transition, which constitutes a particularly challenging test case for the quantum simulation of nonequilibrium processes.</p>

            <p>Classifying the topology of closed curves is a central problem in low dimensional topology with applications beyond mathematics spanning protein folding, polymer physics and even magnetohydrodynamics. The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges.</p>

            <p>We present theoretical and experimental evidence for a new phase of matter in neutron-rich systems that we call multimodal superfluidity. Using ab initio lattice calculations, we show that the condensate consists of coexisting s-wave pairs, p-wave pairs in entangled double pair combinations, and quartets composed of bound states of two s-wave pairs. We identify multimodal superfluidity as a general feature of single-flavor spin-1/2 fermionic systems with attractive s-wave and p-wave interactions, provided the system is stable against collapse into a dense droplet. Beyond neutrons at sub-saturation densities, we demonstrate that this phase appears in generalized attractive extended Hubbard models in one, two, and three dimensions. We elucidate the mechanism for this coexistence using self-consistent few-body Cooper models and compare with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. We also derive the form of the effective action and show that spin, rotational, and parity symmetries remain unbroken. Finally, we analyze experimental data to show that p-wave pair gaps and quartet gaps are present in atomic nuclei, and we discuss the consequences of this new phase for the structure and dynamics of neutron star crusts.</p>

The antiferromagnetically-ordered topological semimetallic state exists in the presence of combined time-reversal and inversion symmetry though individually both are broken. The study of the static magnetic susceptibility indicates the robustness of the antiferromagnetic order within a realistic range of interaction and spin-orbit coupling parameters. In addition to the edge states associated with the Weyl points, we also investigate the spin-resolved quasiparticle interference, which provides important insight into the possible spin texture of the bands especially in the vicinity of Weyl points.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsuya Honma</p>
            <p>In oxygen-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, the spectra, as observed by tunneling or photoemission spectroscopic measurements, depend on the sample fabrication conditions, such as the temperature and pressure for fabricating the junction or surface. This implies that the hump and dip energies extracted from the spectra depend on the sample fabrication conditions. When the samples were fabricated at 4.2 K and/or under ultra-high vacuum (UHV), the hump energy exhibited a new step-like doping dependence and the dip energy followed the upper pseudo-gap line. As the fabrication conditions deteriorated, the hump and dip energies reproduced the previous results, in that the dip energy was significantly dependent on the sample, whereas the hump energy exhibited a smooth doping dependence. It can be concluded that the observations for the samples fabricated at 4.2 K and/or under UHV reflect the intrinsic bulk properties, whereas those for the samples fabricated under deteriorated conditions reflect degraded surface properties.</p>

            <p>Transverse electron transport in magnetic materials - manifested in effects such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects - holds promise for spintronic and thermoelectric applications. While recent advances have focused on enhancing such transport through topological single crystals via intrinsic mechanisms linked to Berry curvature, practical limitations remain due to their mechanical fragility and narrow material scope. Here, we demonstrate a distinct approach for transverse transport enhancement based on composite formation. Using both theoretical modeling and experiments, we show that disordered mixtures of two ferromagnetic materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse electron deflection than either constituent alone. This enhancement originates from meandering electron pathways created by the disordered mixture of two materials and does not rely on long-range crystalline order. The identified requirements for this mechanism can be broadly satisfied across different material systems, offering a universal and tunable strategy to engineer large transverse responses in structurally robust platforms.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered Kagome superconductor AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A refers to K, Rb, Cs) has stimulated widespread research interest due to its interplay of non-trivial topology and unconventional correlated physics including charge-density waves (CDW) and superconductivity. The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $\pi$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken. These observations thus corroborate six-fold rotational symmetry breaking throughout the CDW phase of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$.</p>

            <p>Magnetic effects originating from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been attracting major attention. However, SOC contributions to the electron magnetic moment operator are conventionally disregarded. In this work, we analyze relativistic contributions to the latter operator, including those of the SOC-type: in vacuum, for the semiconductor 8 band Kane model, and for an arbitrary system with two spectral branches. In this endeavor, we introduce a notion of relativistic corrections to the operation $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $\boldsymbol B$ is an external magnetic field. We highlight the difference between the magnetic moment and $-\partial H/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian. We suggest to call this difference the abnormal magnetic moment. We demonstrate that the conventional decomposition of the total magnetic moment into the spin and orbital parts becomes ambiguous when relativistic corrections are taken into account. The latter also jeopardize the "modern theory of orbital magnetization" in its standard formulation. We derive a linear response Kubo formula for the kinetic magnetoelectric effect projected to individual branches of a two branch system. This allows us, in particular, to identify a source of this effect that stems from noncommutation of the position and $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$ operators' components. This is an analog of the contribution to the Hall conductivity from noncommuting components of the position operator. We comment on the relation between such contributions and the Berry curvature theory. We also report several additional observations related to the electron magnetic moment operator in systems with SOC and other relativistic corrections.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Chiral Anomaly in Spin-1 Fermionic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shantonu Mukherjee, Sayantan Sharma, Hridis K. Pal</p>
            <p>Chiral anomaly is a key feature of Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories: in presence of parallel external electric and magnetic fields, the number of massless Weyl fermions of a given chirality is not conserved. In condensed matter, emergent chiral fermions in Weyl semimetals exhibit the same anomaly, directly tied to the topological charge of the Weyl node, ensuring a quantized anomaly coefficient. However, many condensed matter systems break Lorentz symmetry while retaining topological nodes, raising the question of how chiral anomaly manifests in such settings. In this work, we investigate this question in spin-1 fermionic systems and show that the conventional anomaly equation is modified by an additional nontopological contribution, leading to a nonquantized anomaly coefficient. This surprising result arises because spin-1 fermions can be decomposed into 2-flavor Weyl fermions coupled to a Lorentz-breaking, momentum-dependent non-Abelian background potential. The interplay between this potential and external electromagnetic fields generates the extra term in the anomaly equation. Our framework naturally generalizes to other Lorentz-breaking systems beyond the spin-1 case.</p>

            <h2>Predicted third-order sweet spots for phi-junction Josephson parametric amplifiers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tasnum Reza, Sergey M. Frolov</p>
            <p>Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire Josephson junctions exhibit skewed and phi-shifted current phase relations when an in-plane magnetic field is applied along the weak link's spin-orbit effective field direction. These junctions can have an asymmetric Josephson potential with odd-order nonlinearities. A dominant third-order nonlinearity can be achieved by tuning the magnetic field to a sweet spot. Sweet spots persist when higher order Josephson harmonics are included. This makes it possible to have a single Josephson junction dipole element with three-wave mixing capability, which is favorable for pump-efficient amplification. Electrostatic gate tunability of the semiconductor weak link can make it operable within an extended range of working frequencies, and the inclusion of micromagnets can facilitate near-zero magnetic field operation.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a violation of local reciprocity in the interconversion between charge and orbital currents. By investigating orbital torque and orbital pumping in W/Ni bilayers, we show that the charge-orbital interconversion in the bulk of the W layer exhibits opposite signs in the direct and inverse processes -- the direct and inverse orbital Hall effects being positive and negative, respectively. This finding provides direct evidence of local nonreciprocity in the charge-orbital interconversion, in agreement with a theoretical prediction. These results highlight the unique characteristics of charge-orbital coupled transport and offer fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying orbital-current-driven phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium maximum entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Aguilera, Sosuke Ito, Artemy Kolchinsky</p>
            <p>We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</p>

            <h2>Coercivity Landscape Characterizes Dynamic Hysteresis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Chen, Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma</p>
            <p>Hysteresis, with rich dynamical behaviors-especially in interacting systems-has drawn broad research interest. Yet its dynamic scalings across time scales lack a unified description, and their transitions remain unclear. Here, we study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model driven periodically by an external field $H$. For large systems with small noise strength $\sigma$, we find the coercivity $H_c \equiv H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with increasing driving rate $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase, stable plateau ($v_H^0$), $v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to 0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the field-driven first-order phase transition point. In the post-plateau regime, $(H_{c} - H_{P})$ scales with $(v_{H} - v_{P})^{2/3}$ with $v_{P}$ and $H_{P}$ being the reference points of the plateau. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the coercivity plateau as $v_{P}\sim\sigma^{2}$ and $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing renormalization-group theory. Our work provides a panoramic view of finite-time scalings of the hysteresis and offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p>A new phase field dislocation dynamics formulation is presented, which couples micromechanical solvers and the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. Grain boundary (GB)-dislocation interactions are studied by describing GBs as inclusions. Grain boundary properties are computed from Molecular Statics simulations and an additional contribution to the total energy that takes into account the GB energy is considered in the calculations. Interaction of a screw dislocation with minimum energy and metastable states of low and high angle $\langle$110$\rangle$ symmetric tilt grain boundaries are studied. We show good agreement between predictions from our phase field dislocation dynamics formulation and molecular dynamics simulations of grain boundary-dislocation interactions.</p>

            <h2>Odd relaxation in three-dimensional Fermi liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seth Musser, Sankar Das Sarma, Johannes Hofmann</p>
            <p>Recent theoretical works predict a hierarchy of long-lived, non-hydrodynamic modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids arising from the feature$-$supposedly unique to two dimensions$-$that relaxation by head-on scattering is not efficient in the presence of Pauli blocking. This leads to a parity-based separation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly than even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists in isotropic three-dimensional (3D) Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not proceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates of even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\sim T^2$ low-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with odd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of interactions. We find a relative difference between odd-parity and even-parity relaxation rates as large as $40\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong additional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even staggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle scattering. We identify signatures of these odd-parity relaxation rates in the static transverse conductivity as well as the transverse collective mode structure. Our results establish the unexpected existence of a tomographic like regime in higher-dimensional Fermi liquids and suggest experimental probes via transport measurements.</p>

            <h2>Quantizing Bosonized Fermi Surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sihan Chen, Luca V. Delacretaz</p>
            <p>Bosonization describes Fermi surface dynamics in terms of a collective field that lives on a part of phase space. While sensible semiclassically, the challenge of treating such a field quantum mechanically has prevented bosonization from providing as powerful a nonperturbative tool as in one dimension. We show that general Fermi surfaces can be exactly described by a particular $N\to \infty$ limit of a $U(N)_1$ WZW model, with a tower of irrelevant corrections. This matrix-valued description encodes the noncommutative nature of phase space, and its (solvable) strongly coupled dynamics resolves the naive overcounting of degrees of freedom of the collective field without the need to cut the Fermi surface into patches. This approach furthermore provides a quantitative tool to systematically study power-law corrections to Fermi surface dynamics.</p>

            <p>In this paper the excluded volume of binary similar hyperparticles with small size difference in D-dimensional Euclidean spaces R2, R3, and R4 is studied using two different statistical geometry approaches. These geometric approaches, concerning orientation geometry and integral geometry, yield the excluded volume of particle pairs. The excluded volume of rectangles, based on orientation geometry, in Euclidean space R2 is used to derive an explicit equation for the bidisperse packing fraction, which is compatible with the expression published previously. Next, the excluded volume of pairs of convex particles in D = 2, 3 and 4, resulting from integral geometry, are presented. These excluded volumes are identical with the specific ones for circles and rectangles (D = 2) and (sphero)cylinders (D = 3), derived by orientation geometry. Furthermore, these orientation geometry-based excluded volumes contain geometric measures: particle volume, surface area, mean curvature and the second quermassintegral. They allow for the derivation of closed-form expressions for the random packing fraction of binary convex similar hyperparticles in Euclidean spaces R2 , R3 and R4.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juliette Monsel, Matteo Acciai, Didrik Palmqvist, Nicolas Chiabrando, Rafael Sánchez, Janine Splettstoesser</p>
            <p>Quantum-dot systems serve as nanoscale heat engines exploiting thermal fluctuations to perform a useful task. Here, we investigate a multi-terminal triple-dot system, operating as a refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold electronic contact. In contrast to standard heat engines, this system exploits a nonthermal resource. This has the intriguing consequence that cooling can occur without extracting energy from the resource on average -- a seemingly demonic action -- while, however, requiring the resource to fluctuate. Using full counting statistics and stochastic trajectories, we analyze the performance of the device in terms of the cooling-power precision, employing performance quantifiers motivated by the thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. We focus on two regimes with large output power, which are based on two operational principles: exploiting information on one hand and the nonthermal properties of the resource on the other. We show that these regimes significantly differ in precision. In particular, the regime exploiting the nonthermal properties of the resource can have cooling-power fluctuations that are suppressed with respect to the input fluctuations by an order of magnitude. We also substantiate the interpretation of the two different working principles by analyzing cross-correlations between input and output heat currents and information flow.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuhao Jiang, Jad C. Halimeh, N. S. Srivatsa</p>
            <p>In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</p>

Employing the mean-field approximation, we derive the equations of motion for the spin polarization and the two-time spin-spin correlation functions. The methodology is applied to the study of spin-wave dynamics and to the formulation of a phenomenological model for resistance fluctuations in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate how the injector region design of interband cascade lasers (ICLs) impacts the threshold carrier and current densities. The model combines a polarization-sensitive 8-band $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ calculation, electrostatics, and a microscopic calculation of Auger recombination rates. The inelastic carrier-carrier scattering is included to lowest order using quasi-equilibrium Green's functions. It captures the combined effects of charge-carrier redistribution, parasitic absorption, and bias voltage on the Auger recombination rate. We show that heavily doping the electron injector suppresses the dominant multi-hole Auger recombination by reducing the hole population of the recombination quantum wells. This agrees with the experimental observation that the heavy doping reduces threshold currents. Unlike the measurements, however, they do not increase at high doping concentrations in our model, which does not include scattering-mediated carrier escape and/or light absorption. Furthermore, by introducing indium to the conventional $\mathrm{Ga}\mathrm{Sb}$ hole injector wells, we explain the rule of thumb from experiments that raising the hole injector levels does not outperform the doping strategy. Our model provides physical insights for optimizing ICL carrier injectors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis S. Grebenkov, Yilin Ye</p>
            <p>Boundary-catalytic branching processes describe a broad class of natural phenomena where the population of diffusing particles grows due to their spontaneous binary branching (e.g., division, fission or splitting) on a catalytic boundary located in a complex environment. We investigate the possibility of the geometric control of the population growth by compensating the proliferation of particles due to catalytic branching events by their absorptions in the bulk or on absorbing regions of the boundary. We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction in a bounded domain. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system. Moreover, we show the existence of a critical catalytic rate above which no compensation is possible, so that the population cannot be controlled and keeps growing exponentially. The proposed framework opens promising perspectives for better understanding, modeling and control of various boundary-catalytic branching processes, with applications in physics, chemistry, and life sciences.</p>

            <p>We extend the capabilities of correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem by implementing the analytical atomic forces within the random phase approximation (RPA), in the context of plane waves and pseudopotentials. Forces are calculated at self-consistency through the optimized effective potential method and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition, non-self-consistent RPA forces, starting from the PBE generalized gradient approximation, are evaluated using density functional perturbation theory. In both cases, we find forces of excellent numerical quality. Furthermore, for most molecules and solids studied, self-consistency is found to have a negligible impact on the computed geometries and vibrational frequencies. The RPA is shown to systematically improve over PBE and, by including the exact-exchange kernel within RPA + exchange (RPAx), through finite-difference total energy calculations, we obtain an accuracy comparable to advanced wavefunction methods. Finally, we estimate the anharmonic shift and provide accurate theoretical references based on RPA and RPAx for the zone-center optical phonon of diamond, silicon, and germanium.</p>

            <p>We introduce a method for constructing global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories, starting from perturbative results. The key idea is to employ interpolation method, such as the two-point Padé expansion, to interpolate the weak and strong coupling expansions of correlation function. We benchmark this many-body interpolation approach on two prototypical models: the lattice $\phi^4$ field theory and the 2D Hubbard model. For the $\phi^4$ theory, the resulting two point Padé approximants exhibit uniform and global convergence to the exact correlation function. For the Hubbard model, we show that even at second order, the Padé appproximant already provides reasonable characterization of the Matsubara Green's function for a wide range of parameters. Finally, we offer a heuristic explanation for these convergence properties based on analytic function theory.</p>

By constructing a spin model that reproduces the observed INS magnon spectra and field-dependence of the Raman $\Gamma$-magnons, we directly probe the topological magnon nodal lines and observe their associated signature of non-trivial topology through the pseudo-spin winding of the scattering intensity in angular scans near the nodal lines. Finally, we discuss how to induce Weyl magnons in the spectrum through an external magnetic field, shedding light on future in-field INS and thermal Hall experiments. This work establishes a clear magnonic analog to Weyl electrons, enabling further exploration of topological behavior in bosonic systems and highlighting the interplay between magnetic order and band topology in non-coplanar antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising for nanoscale electronics and photonics, but practical deployment requires chirality control. Most catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) growth of SWCNTs proceeds on liquid metal nanoparticles via a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism and yields broad chirality distributions, whereas improved selectivity has been reported for high-melting-point crystalline catalysts, suggesting vapor-solid-solid (VSS) growth. However, the atomistic mechanism and kinetic of VSS SWCNT growth remain unclear. Here it is shown, using machine-learning interatomic potential-driven molecular dynamics on rhenium nanoparticles, that VSS growth is diffusion-limited and governed by facet-dependent surface carbon transport coupled to carbon-driven facet reconfiguration without catalyst melting. Surface diffusion is up to $\sim 50\times$ slower than carbon diffusion in liquid iron, imposing a strict upper bound on sustainable carbon supply and producing a narrow growth window: insufficient transport drives carbon accumulation and multiple nucleation, whereas higher temperatures favor graphitic encapsulation. In contrast to defect-free VLS growth, defects persist, indicating slow defect healing, and equilibrium simulations reveal suppressed edge configurational entropy with stabilization of zigzag-rich, Klein-decorated edges. Together, these results establish facet evolution and surface diffusion as joint regulators of diffusion-limited VSS growth and motivate stringent control of temperature and carbon supply.</p>

The calculated results of cleavage toughness and surface energy of typical ionic and covalent crystals by the present formulae are in excellent agreement with the experimental values.

Not only is this motivated by increased industry profitability, but it can also be optimized to reduce waste generation, energy consumption, and gas emissions through additive manufacturing (AM) and AI/ML-directed self-driving laboratory (SDL) process optimization. From this perspective, the benefits of using 3D printing technology to manufacture durable, sustainable materials will enable high-value reuse and promote a better circular economy. Using AI/ML workflows at different levels, it is possible to optimize the synthesis and adaptation of new bio-derived materials with self-correcting 3D printing methods, and in-situ characterization. Working with training data and hypotheses derived from Large Language Models (LLMs) and algorithms, including ML-optimized simulation, it is possible to demonstrate more field convergence. The combination of SDL and AI/ML Workflows can be the norm for improved use of biobased and renewable materials towards advanced manufacturing. This should result in faster and better structure, composition, processing, and properties (SCPP) correlation. More agentic AI tasks, as well as supervised or unsupervised learning, can be incorporated to improve optimization protocols continuously. Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be applied to more generative AI directions in both AM and SDL, with bio-based materials.</p>

Our analysis reveals both ergodic and nonergodic regimes; importantly, we find broad parameter ranges where the dynamics is ergodic even though it lies outside the Gibbsian parameter regime (for both $D=0.25$ and $D=2$), and a higher-energy range where ergodicity breaks down. We observe that in a certain range of parameters, the system requires non-standard statistical descriptions, indicating a breakdown of conventional thermalization. We examine the influence of the nonlinear dispersion parameter $D$ on the system's behavior, showing that increasing $D$ enhances fluctuations and speeds up the crossover of $q(T)$ toward the $\sim 1/T$ scaling. By analyzing excursion times, probability density functions, and localization patterns, we characterize transitions between ergodic and nonergodic behavior. In long-time numerical simulations within the non-ergodic regime for $D>1$, stable localization over two sites is observed, while $D<1$ favors single-site localization in the high energy density regimes. Our results provide insights into the interplay between thermalization, localization, and non-standard statistical behavior in genuinely nonlinear systems.</p>

            <p>Topological materials hold immense promise for exhibiting exotic quantum phenomena, yet achieving controllable topological phase transitions remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a structurally driven, reversible topological phase transition in the distorted square net material GdPS, induced via in situ potassium dosing. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first principles calculations, we demonstrate a cascade of topological phases in the sub-surface P layer: from a large, topologically trivial band gap to a gapless Dirac cone state with a 2 eV dispersion, and finally to a two-dimensional topological insulator as inferred from theory. This evolution is driven by subtle structural distortions in the first P layer caused by potassium adsorption, which in turn contribute to the band gap closure and topological phase transition. Furthermore, the ability to manipulate the topology of a sub-surface layer in GdPS offers a unique route for exploring and controlling topological states in bulk materials.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate control of helimagnetic order in biaxially strained SrFeO3 thin films using neutron diffraction and resonant soft x-ray scattering. SrFeO3, a negative charge-transfer oxide, exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram that includes multi-q spin structures. Tensile epitaxial strain produces a pronounced shortening of the helimagnetic ordering length and a tilting of the magnetic ordering vector. We interpret this behavior in terms of chemical expansion: lattice dilation under tensile strain lowers the energetic cost of oxygen vacancies, leading to an expanded unit cell that modifies Fe-O hybridization and enhances superexchange relative to double exchange. These results reveal how epitaxial strain can indirectly tune helimagnetism through defect-driven chemical expansion, highlighting the strong coupling between lattice, chemistry, and magnetic order in transition-metal oxides. Our findings establish chemical expansion as an effective mechanism for engineering complex magnetic textures in oxide thin films, with implications for spintronic, magnonic, and quantum information applications.</p>

            <p>Heavy-fermion metals are prototype correlated electron systems for the study of Kondo entanglement and quantum criticality. We use the symmetry decomposed elastoresistance to uncover the fingerprints of strain-dependent Kondo scattering as function of temperature and magnetic field in the prototypical tetragonal Kondo lattice YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. By combining longitudinal and transverse resistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along the tetragonal $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions, we obtain the elastoresistive responses in the $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. While the responses in the symmetry-breaking channels are negligible, the isotropic $A_{1g}$ elastoresistance displays characteristic sign changes and approaches huge values at low temperatures. Scaling analysis and comparison with linear thermal expansion measurements reveals that the elastoresistance probes the contribution of Kondo scattering to the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and signals strain-controlled quantum criticality upon cooling to 2 K.</p>

            <h2>Mystery of the 175 cm$^{-1}$ Raman Mode in MnTe Altermagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bishal Thapa, K. D. Belashchenko, Igor I. Mazin</p>
            <p>MnTe has recently attracted exceptional attention due to its well-established altermagnetism, prompting a thorough reexamination of its properties. In particular, it was found that a Raman-active excitation at ~175 cm$^{-1}$, routinely assigned to the E2g phonon, is incompatible with this interpretation. It was further hypothesized that this mode is a "leakage", due to symmetry lowering, of an otherwise forbidden phonon. Here, using first-principles calculations, we decisively rule out this hypothesis and propose an alternative interpretation that the "mystery mode" is an electronic excitation, i.e., a plasmon, enabled by hole self-doping. The resolution of this mystery will require additional experiments and shed new light on the nature of electronic transport in MnTe.</p>

            <p>Unambiguous identification of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors (TSCs) remains a challenge due to complex in-gap states that can also produce zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBPs). Here we demonstrate a data-driven workflow that integrates pixel-wise spectral deconvolution with machine-learning (ML) to analyze tunneling spectroscopy from FeTe0.55Se0.45, an intrinsic TSC. Based on the local density of states (LDOS) spectra acquired with a millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope under magnetic fields, each spectrum was decomposed into multiple Lorentzian peaks. The extracted peak parameters were assembled into a structured feature set and subsequently embedded and clustered with unsupervised ML algorithms. ML-based clustering identified distinct classes of LDOS spectra, separating superconductor vortices exhibiting ZBPs consistent with established characteristics of MZMs from vortices displaying ZBP-mimicking features of trivial origin. Furthermore, spatially resolved ZBP distributions differentiate isotropic vortex cores with well-defined ZBPs from vortices that exhibit locally distorted ZBPs. By comparing the ZBP distributions to defect locations measured without magnetic field, we found a correlation between local heterogeneity and the ZBP formation, necessitating the systematic, data-driven analysis to disentangle genuine MZM signatures in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow advances reliable MZM detection in TSCs, providing a foundation for MZM manipulation towards quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Elucidating the role of the kagome electronic structure in determining the various quantum ground states is of fundamental importance. In this work, we employ in-plane uniaxial stress as a tuning parameter to probe the electronic structure and its impact on the superconducting and normal-state properties of the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, combining magnetotransport measurements with first-principles calculations. We identify a pronounced anisotropy in both the upper critical field and the normal-state magnetoresistance, indicating strong electronic anisotropy despite the three-dimensional crystal structure. Furthermore, we find that the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ increases under in-plane stress applied within the kagome plane, although the enhancement is modest, reaching approximately 0.3 K at 0.6 GPa. Furthermore, the absolute magnetoresistance exhibits a pronounced increase from about 22${\%}$ at zero stress to 35${\%}$ at 0.6 GPa, indicating a substantial modification of the normal state above $T_{\rm c}$. Previous studies have reported time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking below a temperature scale that coincides with the onset of magnetoresistance. The simultaneous enhancement of both $T_{\rm c}$ and magnetoresistance under stress therefore suggests a positive correlation between superconductivity and normal-state electronic and magnetic properties in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$. Detailed calculations demonstrate that stress-induced changes in $T_{\rm c}$ arise from the joint evolution of the total density of states and the flat band, whereas the large magnetoresistance enhancement is dominated by the stress-driven downward shift of the Ru $dz^{2}$ kagome flat band.</p>

            <h2>Decoherence of Josephson coupling and thermal quenching of the Josephson diode effect in bilayer superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Yang, C. Y. Dong, Joshua A. Robinson, L. Q. Chen</p>
            <p>Motivated by recent studies on superconducting (SC) diode nonreciprocity, we uncover an unexpected hierarchy of SC-phase decoherence in bilayer superconductors hosting both interlayer Josephson coupling and a Josephson diode effect. Contrary to the conventional single-energy-scale paradigm where Josephson coherence and diode nonreciprocity vanish simultaneously at the SC gap-closing temperature, we demonstrate, using a self-consistent microscopic theory incorporating phase fluctuations, that the system undergoes a sequence of distinct thermal crossovers upon heating: the diode effect disappears first at $T_{\eta}$, Josephson coherence is subsequently lost at $T_c$, and the SC gap collapses only at a higher temperature $T_s$. Rather than a direct SC-normal transition, the system thus evolves through successive nonreciprocal, reciprocal, and incoherent Josephson regimes before entering the normal state. Counterintuitively, the separation between these regimes is governed not only by interlayer coupling, but also sensitively by in-plane disorder and carrier density. These findings point to a generic hierarchy of SC decoherence in low-dimensional Josephson systems, and suggest broader relevance to layered superconductors, including cuprates and recently discovered nickelates, as well as to SC qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolyn Zhang, Yichen Xu, Jian-Hao Zhang, Cenke Xu, Zhen Bi, Zhu-Xi Luo</p>
            <p>Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a Rényi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, & Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite Rényi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaurav Hajong, Ranjan Modak, Bhabani Prasad Mandal</p>
            <p>The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning that they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of an NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct topological phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a {\it{first order knot transition}} between different knot structures. Unlike the usual knot transition, this transition is not accompanied by an Exceptional point (EP); in contrast, the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian show a discrete jump at the transition point. We emphasize that the choice of an NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is the same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</p>

            <p>We report the experimental realization of a large-area and multi-axis atomtronic interferometer in an optical waveguide for rotation sensing. A large enclosed area is achieved through multi-loop operation in a guided atom interferometer using Bose-Einstein condensates. We demonstrate a three-loop interferometer with a total interrogation time of ~ 0.4 s and an enclosed area of 8.7 mm$^2$- the largest reported in a fully guided or one-dimensional setup. High-contrast interference fringes are observed for up to five Sagnac orbits in a smaller loop-area configuration. Our approach enables interleaved rotation measurements about multiple arbitrary axes within the same experimental setup. We present results for area-enclosing interferometers in both horizontal and vertical planes, demonstrating that the interferometer contrast remains comparable across orthogonal orientations of the enclosed area vectors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqi Qing, Yu-Qin Chen, Shi-Xin Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system featuring a single-particle mobility edge (SPME), described by the generalized Aubry-André (GAA) model. This model offers a unique platform to study the consequences of coexisting localized and extended eigenstates, which contrasts sharply with the abrupt localization transition in the standard Aubry-André model. We analyze the system's response to a quantum quench through two complementary probes: entanglement entropy (EE) and subsystem information capacity (SIC). We find that the SPME induces a smooth crossover in all dynamical signatures. The EE saturation value exhibits a persistent volume-law scaling in the mobility-edge phase, with an entropy density that continuously decreases as the number of available extended states decreases. Complementing this, the SIC profile interpolates between the linear ramp characteristic of extended systems and the information trapping behavior of localized ones, directly visualizing the mixed nature of the underlying spectrum. Our results establish unambiguous dynamical fingerprints of a mobility edge, providing a crucial non-interacting benchmark for understanding information and entanglement dynamics in more complex systems with mixed phases.</p>

            <p>Boundary time crystals (BTCs) in dissipative collective spin systems have been extensively studied using numerical, mean-field, and perturbative approaches. However, an explicit Liouvillian description governing the long-time dynamics deep within the time crystal phase has remained elusive. Here, we derive an effective Liouvillian that analytically captures the extreme BTC regime, where dissipation is parametrically weak and oscillatory order is maximally robust. By introducing a superspin representation of Liouville space, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Liouvillian eigenvalues to first order in the dissipation strength, providing direct access to decay rates, oscillation frequencies, and their thermodynamic scaling. Applying this framework to the canonical BTC model we analytically recover spontaneous breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry and persistent oscillations in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, we show that other dissipative spin models exhibit only single-frequency oscillatory dynamics and therefore do not support genuine BTC phases. Our results establish a controlled analytical framework for the long-time dynamics in the extreme BTC regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rubén Gordillo-Hachuel, Ricardo Puebla</p>
            <p>A recent article [S. Ashhab and M. Ayyash, New J. Phys. 27, 054104 (2025)] has reported unexpected oscillatory dynamics in generalized squeezed states of order higher than two as their squeezing parameter increases. This behaviour, observed through numerical simulations using truncated bosonic annihilation and creation operators, appeared in several properties of these states, including their average photon number. The authors argued that these oscillations reflect a genuine physical effect. Here, however, we demonstrate that the observed oscillatory behaviour is a consequence of numerical artefacts. A numerical analysis reveals that the oscillations are highly sensitive to the truncation of the Fock basis, indicating a lack of convergence. This is further supported by a theoretical analysis of the Taylor series of the average photon number, suggesting that these generalized squeezed states contain infinite energy after a finite value of the squeezing parameter. Finally, we provide an analytical proof that the average photon number of any generalized squeezed state is a non-decreasing function, thereby ruling out the possibility of intrinsic oscillatory dynamics. We hope these results help clarify the origin of the reported oscillations and highlight the special care required when dealing with high-order squeezing states.</p>

Our frequency reference is based on a dispersion-optimized, fiber-based frequency comb that enables sub-kHz linewidths.

The comb-stabilized system is benchmarked against a conventional cavity-locked laser and achieves comparable performance in broadband and single-frequency MOTs using the narrow $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_1$ laser cooling transition. We generate high-flux, sub-$\mu$K samples of all three bosonic strontium isotopes and demonstrate quasi-continuous outcoupling from the MOT.

By applying active feedback on the MOT position to a dispersion-optimized frequency comb, which serves as the reference for stabilizing the MOT laser [1], we achieve a frequency instability below $4.4\times10^{-13}$ after 400 s of averaging in both the optical and radio-frequency domains, surpassing the performance of conventional hot-vapor modulation transfer spectroscopy. Our method is a broadly applicable alternative route to frequency references in the high $10^{-14}$ range around 100 s.</p>

            <p>Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Tsunaki, Michael Dotan, Kseniia Volkova, Boris Naydenov</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a hardware-agnostic protocol for realizing fast, high-fidelity gates through dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences applied to a central qubit coupled to target qubits. The target qubits are controlled by leveraging their intrinsic interaction with the central qubit, eliminating the need for slow, error-prone direct control. We develop and implement the DD-gate protocol within two distinct frameworks: a general model with minimal assumptions, benchmarked on a gate-based digital quantum simulator given by the IBMQ; and an experimentally realistic case with a nitrogen-15 vacancy center ($^{15}$NV) in diamond. Using IBMQ, we are able to elucidate the underlying quantum dynamics of the DD-gates and test them, independently of experimental constraints. For $^{15}$NV, we realize the protocol considering system-specific properties, which could represent a significant reduction in gate duration and improved technological scalability compared with current dynamical-decoupling-based control. We also propose a simple application for high-efficiency polarization of the $^{15}$N nuclear spin that could potentially be less technically demanding than current methods. Altogether, this work provides a robust strategy for quantum control that can be implemented in arbitrary systems fitting the central-target qubit architecture. Beyond these results, our open-source simulations and implementations for both platforms provide a practical framework for simulating time-dependent qubit dynamics on NISQ-era gate-based quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide worldwide, crystallizes through complex intermolecular interactions that are strongly influenced by synthesis-derived impurities. Understanding this process at the molecular scale is critical for optimizing production, ensuring product quality, and assessing environmental impact. Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent synthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in aqueous solutions. Our simulations identify two major mechanisms by which glycine hinders crystallization. First, direct coexistence simulations show that glycine preferentially adsorbs at crystal surfaces, hindering glyphosate attachment and slowing growth. Second, free energy calculations demonstrate that glycine enhances glyphosate solubility, reducing the supersaturation driving force to incorporate into the crystal phase. Experimental measurements corroborate our predictions, confirming both enhanced solubility and reduced crystallization kinetics in glycine-bearing systems. These findings establish that glycine-typically considered an inert impurity-actively disrupts glyphosate crystallization by promoting its dissolution. More broadly, this integrated computational-experimental approach highlights the power of molecular simulations to disentangle impurity effects, interfacial phenomena, and solution thermodynamics in crystallization, providing molecular-level insights for optimizing industrial protocols and predicting agrochemical behavior under relevant environmental conditions.</p>

            <p>Optically accessible, scalable planar nanofluidic channels are attractive for studying transport and localization under confinement. Two dimensional (2D) materials provide large area, atomically flat interfaces for generating such platforms, yet achieving long range one-dimensional (1D) confinement with top-down nanofabrication remains challenging because it requires reproducible nanoscale feature control over extended distances, high yield, and low nonspecific adsorption of analytes under aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkling of exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) produces self-assembled, liquid-accessible, channel-like networks through a lithography-free process. By varying flake thickness and substrate choice, we quantify statistical trends in wrinkle density and morphology, thereby establishing a practical fabrication design space. Atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy reveal wrinkle-derived geometries with vertical confinement ranging from <2 nm to >100 nm depending on flake thickness and substrate. We further employ time-sequence optical imaging upon droplet-contact, which together with Raman mapping of the water OH-stretch band and capacitance-gradient mapping (dC/dz) by scanning dielectric microscopy (KPFM-based) measurements, demonstrates liquid infiltration and long-term liquid retention within the wrinkle network for more than 10 h. We finally show a proof-of-concept biomolecule confinement application in which we integrate a graphene overlayer as a background suppression interface, enabling wide-field fluorescence localization of ATTO647N labeled DNA along hBN wrinkle-induced nanochannels. Overall, this work establishes self-assembled hBN wrinkles as a scalable, and optically addressable planar nanofluidic platform for confinement of fluids and biomolecules.</p>

            <h2>Many-body symmetry-protected zero boundary modes of synthetic photo-magnonic crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Gardin, Emilio Cobanera, Giuseppe C. Tettamanzi</p>
            <p>The topological classification of insulators and superconductors, the "ten-fold way", is grounded on fermionic many-body symmetries and has had a dramatic impact on many fields of physics. Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Albert, Yamato Honda, Justin Kaidi, Yunqin Zheng</p>
            <p>We suggest that the chiral $(\mathfrak{e}_8)_1$ theory -- in many senses the simplest VOA -- may have Haagerup symmetry $\mathcal{H}_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David J. Meer, Shivnag Sista, Mark D. Shattuck, Corey S. O'Hern, Eric R. Weeks</p>
            <p>We describe combined experiments and simulations of droplet breakup during flow-driven interactions with a circular obstacle in a quasi-two-dimensional microfluidic chamber. Due to a lack of in-plane confinement, the droplets can also slip past the obstacle without breaking. Droplets are more likely to break when they have a higher flow velocity, larger size (relative to the obstacle radius R), smaller surface tension, and for head-on collisions with the obstacle. We also observe that droplet-obstacle collisions are more likely to result in breakup when the height of the sample chamber is increased. We define a nondimensional breakup number Bk ~ Ca, where Ca is the Capillary number, that accounts for changes in the likelihood of droplet break up with variations in these parameters. As Bk increases, we find in both experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of the deformable particle model that the behavior changes from droplets never breaking (Bk << 1) to always breaking for Bk >> 1, with a rapid change in the probability of droplet breakup near Bk = 1. We also find that Bk ~ S^(4/3), where S characterizes the symmetry of the collision, which implies that the minimum symmetry required for breakup is controlled by a characteristic distance h ~ R.</p>

            <h2>Higher-Order Corrections to Scrambling Dynamics in Brownian Spin SYK Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tingfei Li, Miao Wang, Jianghui Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate operator growth in a Brownian spin Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model with random all-to-all interactions, focusing on the full operator-size distribution. For Hamiltonians containing interactions of order two up to $L$, we derive a closed master equation for the Pauli-string expansion coefficients and recast their dynamics into a generating-function formulation suitable for the large-$N$ limit. This approach allows us to diagonalize the leading-order evolution operator explicitly and obtain exact solutions for arbitrary initial operator distributions, including the effects of decoherence. Going beyond leading order, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion that captures higher-order corrections to the operator-size dynamics and the late-time behavior. Our results demonstrate that higher-order effects play a crucial role in operator scrambling and that the full operator-size distribution provides a more refined probe of quantum chaos in Brownian and open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Long-Range Pairing in the Kitaev Model: Krylov Subspace Signatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Jha, Heiko Georg Menzler</p>
            <p>Krylov subspace methods quantify operator growth in quantum many-body systems through Lanczos coefficients that encode how operators spread under time evolution. While these diagnostics have been proposed to distinguish quantum chaos from integrability, quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians are widely expected to exhibit trivial Lanczos structure. Here we demonstrate that Lanczos coefficients generated from local boundary operators provide a quantitative diagnostic of whether the lowest excitation gap is controlled by boundary-localized or bulk-extended modes in the long-range Kitaev chain, the model for topological superconductivity with algebraically decaying couplings. We introduce $Krylov$ $staggering$ $parameter$, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Kikuchi</p>
            <p>Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</p>

            <p>We digitally simulate quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved backgrounds using 80 superconducting qubits on IBM Heron processors. By engineering spatially varying couplings in the spin-$\frac12$ XXZ chain, consistent with the low-energy description of the model in terms of an inhomogeneous Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, we realize excitations that follow geodesics of an effective metric inherited from the underlying spatial deformation. Following quenches from Néel and few-spin-flip states, we observe curved light-cone propagation, horizon-induced freezing in the local magnetization, and position-dependent oscillation frequencies set by the engineered spatial deformation. Despite strong spatial inhomogeneity, unequal-time correlators reveal ballistic quasiparticle propagation in the spin chain. These results establish large-scale digital quantum processors as a flexible platform for detailed and controlled exploration of many-body dynamics in tunable and synthetic curved spacetimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rakshit Kumar Singh, Aryan Amit Barsainyan, Bharath Ramsundar</p>
            <p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used for first-principles simulations in chemistry and materials science, but its computational cost remains a key limitation for large systems. Motivated by recent advances in ML-based exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, this paper introduces a differentiable framework that integrates machine learning models into density functional theory (DFT) for solids and other periodic systems. The framework defines a clean API for neural network models that can act as drop in replacements for conventional exchange-correlation (XC) functionals and enables gradients to flow through the full self-consistent DFT workflow. The framework is implemented in Python using a PyTorch backend, making it fully differentiable and easy to use with standard deep learning tools. We integrate the implementation with the DeepChem library to promote the reuse of established models and to lower the barrier for experimentation. In initial benchmarks against established electronic structure packages (GPAW and PySCF), our models achieve relative errors on the order of 5-10%.</p>

            <h2>Breaking of clustering and macroscopic coherence under the lens of asymmetry measures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florent Ferro</p>
            <p>In one-dimensional systems, spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) states are fragile by nature, as the injection of a non-zero energy density above the ground state is expected to restore the symmetry. This instability implies that local perturbations can lead to macroscopic correlation profiles, a breaking of clustering properties and even macroscopic quantum superpositions. In this work, we investigate the effect of interaction on this phenomenology by considering an interacting model with conserved domain wall number, that possesses a ferromagnetic ground state breaking the Z2 symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We first show that a local quench in this system amplifies quantum interferences, producing a macroscopic magnetisation profile that directly reflects the scattering phase of the model. Then, we use two asymmetry measures, namely the Entanglement Asymmetry (EA) and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), to characterise the quantum coherence associated with the fluctuations of the magnetisation. By focusing on subsystems comparable in size to the light-cone of the perturbation, we confirm the emergence of macroscopic quantum coherence throughout the whole perturbed region. Finally, we discuss the link between EA and QFI and show that the variance/EA inequality for pure state can be generalised to a QFI/EA inequality for mixed states.</p>

            <p>Chromium thiophosphate is a long-known material: a layered semiconducting antiferromagnet. Its recently discovered gate-tunable metamagnetic phase transitions, the remarkable positive and oscillating magnetoresistance as a tunnel barrier, and its Fano-resonance luminescence, elusive among the multitude of Cr3+ compounds, call for revisiting the understanding of its electronic structure, especially regarding how it relates to magnetic order. Here, we employ X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, implemented in both absorption and resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopies, together with quantum many-body calculations, to unveil the complex nature of magnetoelectronic coupling in CrPS4, featuring hybridization between crystal-field and charge-transfer transitions. We reveal the role of extended superexchange paths involving P and S atoms, mediating interactions between the Cr spins across the different magnetic phases: antiferromagnetic, canted, and ferromagnetic. Our results elucidate the electronic states involved in these phases and provide prescriptions for engineering the metamagnetic phase diagram of CrPS4.</p>

            <p>Graphene-based systems have emerged as a rich platform for exploring emergent quantum phenomena-including superconductivity, magnetism, and correlated insulating behavior-arising from flat electronic bands that enhance many-body interactions. Realizing such flat bands has thus far relied primarily on moiré graphene superlattices or rhombohedral stacking graphene systems, both of which face challenges in reproducibility and tunability. Here, we introduce an artificial Kagome superlattice in bilayer graphene, engineered via nanopatterning of the dielectric substrate to create a precisely defined and electrostatically tunable periodic potential. Magnetotransport measurements reveal the emergence of a stack of correlated insulating states at moderate superlattice potentials, characteristic of strong electron-electron interactions within Kagome-induced flat bands. As temperature increases, these correlated gaps collapse, signaling the thermal suppression of interaction-driven states. Continuum-model calculations confirm the formation of multiple flat minibands and reproduce the observed evolution of band reconstruction. Our results establish dielectric-patterned graphene superlattices as a robust and controllable architecture for realizing flat-band-induced correlated phenomena beyond moiré systems.</p>

            <p>Symmetry offers a useful approach to unfold the intertwined degrees of freedom. Thus it paves the way to resolve coexisting quantum orders into distinct symmetry sectors. Motivated by the recent observation of superconductivity in nano-flaked IrTe$_2$, we investigate the superconductivity in strain-stabilized two-dimensional (2D) limit of IrTe$_2$ by combining density-functional theory with mean-field solution of spin-fluctuation mediated pairing interaction on a symmetry-constrained ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ model. The spin-orbit coupled band structure shows $\Gamma$-centred Fermi sheets with coexistence of band-selective Rashba-like (in-plane) and Ising-like (out-of-plane) superconductivity. Remarkably, the superconducting gaps are odd in spin, orbital, and momentum channels despite the presence of global inversion symmetry. Fermi surface topologies and little-group symmetry enforce distinct irreducible representations to the Rashba and Ising channels, forbidding their mixing. Our findings open up a symmetry-based route to multichannel superconductivity in 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides with unique functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Decoherence of Josephson coupling and thermal quenching of the Josephson diode effect in bilayer superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Yang, C. Y. Dong, Joshua A. Robinson, L. Q. Chen</p>
            <p>Motivated by recent studies on superconducting (SC) diode nonreciprocity, we uncover an unexpected hierarchy of SC-phase decoherence in bilayer superconductors hosting both interlayer Josephson coupling and a Josephson diode effect. Contrary to the conventional single-energy-scale paradigm where Josephson coherence and diode nonreciprocity vanish simultaneously at the SC gap-closing temperature, we demonstrate, using a self-consistent microscopic theory incorporating phase fluctuations, that the system undergoes a sequence of distinct thermal crossovers upon heating: the diode effect disappears first at $T_{\eta}$, Josephson coherence is subsequently lost at $T_c$, and the SC gap collapses only at a higher temperature $T_s$. Rather than a direct SC-normal transition, the system thus evolves through successive nonreciprocal, reciprocal, and incoherent Josephson regimes before entering the normal state. Counterintuitively, the separation between these regimes is governed not only by interlayer coupling, but also sensitively by in-plane disorder and carrier density. These findings point to a generic hierarchy of SC decoherence in low-dimensional Josephson systems, and suggest broader relevance to layered superconductors, including cuprates and recently discovered nickelates, as well as to SC qubits.</p>

            <p>Bismuth oxide (Bi$_2$O$_3$) is a polymorphic material of considerable technological interest, with applications spanning from heterogeneous catalysis to next-generation nanoelectronics. Despite its relevance, systematic investigations of Bi$_2$O$_3$ thin films remain scarce. Here, we report a comprehensive, multi-technique study of bismuth oxide grown on Au(111). By combining synchrotron-based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffraction with low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy, we elucidate the structural evolution of the surface during controlled oxidation and subsequent annealing. We find that Bi deposition induces well-defined surface reconstructions, whereas oxidation triggers the formation of a complex sequence of Bi$_2$O$_3$ domains. High-resolution spectroscopic and diffraction data enable us to propose a structural model consistent with the $(201)$ surface of $\beta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$. In addition, work function measurements reveal substantial electronic modifications at the interface. These results provide benchmark structural and electronic insights into the Bi oxide/Au(111) system and establish a framework for integrating Bi$_2$O$_3$ in devices in combination to two-dimensional semiconductors exploiting its low contact resistance.</p>

            <p>While it has been one of the most important new physics discoveries in the last decade, the nature of superconductivity in the twisted graphene family remains an unsolved problem. Motivated by recent scanning tunneling experiments that report Kekulé ordering in moiré graphene superconductors, we develop a microscopic theory of this superconductivity for the twisted bilayer system. The pairing we find is an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) that intrinsically carries a Kekulé modulation. This state exhibits four salient features: (i) spontaneous breaking of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, producing nematic order (ii)with triplet pairing; and (iii) a quasiparticle density of states that evolves from a V-shaped profile to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum as the attraction increases which is accompanied by (iv) systematic behavior of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance. These features align with key experimental signatures. We find, as well, that with only modest interaction strengths, the state is near to a BEC-like phase, consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Taken together, these results identify a microscopic intra-valley Kekulé PDW as a compelling candidate for unconventional superconductivity in the twisted graphene family.</p>

We find that the spin configuration of the twin-skyrmion adapts to the direction of the IL-DMI by elongating or changing the helicities in the two layers. Driving the skyrmions by spin-polarized currents in the current-perpendicular-to-plane configuration, we observe significant changes either in the skyrmion velocity or in the skyrmion Hall angle depending on the current polarization. These findings unravel further prospects for skyrmion manipulation enabled by the IL-DMI.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity is usually understood as a phase in which charge-$2e$ Cooper pairs are condensed. Charge-$4e$ superconductivity has largely been discussed as a vestigial order at finite temperature emerging from charge-$2e$ states. Primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phases at zero temperature remain scarce in both experiments and microscopic models. Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case. We further characterize the corresponding normal states and discuss the resulting finite temperature phase diagram.</p>

            <p>The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.</p>

Based on the local density of states (LDOS) spectra acquired with a millikelvin scanning tunnelling microscope under magnetic fields, each spectrum was decomposed into multiple Lorentzian peaks. The extracted peak parameters were assembled into a structured feature set and subsequently embedded and clustered with unsupervised ML algorithms. ML-based clustering identified distinct classes of LDOS spectra, separating superconductor vortices exhibiting ZBPs consistent with established characteristics of MZMs from vortices displaying ZBP-mimicking features of trivial origin. Furthermore, spatially resolved ZBP distributions differentiate isotropic vortex cores with well-defined ZBPs from vortices that exhibit locally distorted ZBPs. By comparing the ZBP distributions to defect locations measured without magnetic field, we found a correlation between local heterogeneity and the ZBP formation, necessitating the systematic, data-driven analysis in disentangling genuine MZM signatures in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow paves the way to further manipulating MZMs in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow advances reliable MZM detection in TSCs, providing a foundation for MZM manipulation towards quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Diode effect in microwave irradiated Josephson junctions with Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aritra Lahiri, Marcel Polák, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>We investigate the critical current in microwave-irradiated Josephson junctions hosting Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states due to magnetic impurities. Under two conditions, namely, (i) the breaking of particle-hole symmetry in the normal sense by non-zero potential scattering, and (ii) the breaking of inversion symmetry either by unequal magnitudes of potential scattering and/or magnetic moments, microwave irradiation induces an additional phase-independent contribution to the current. This leads to asymmetric critical currents for opposite current polarities, an effect absent in the same junction without microwave irradiation. The asymmetry is highly tunable via the microwave amplitude and frequency, and we may even achieve perfect asymmetry where the critical current vanishes for one polarity, akin to a perfect diode. While Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states provide the ideal platform for a pronounced asymmetry, we find that as long as the two conditions (i) and (ii) above are met, our proposal does not necessarily depend upon them.</p>

            <h2>Universal electrical transport of composite Fermi liquid to Metal transition in Moiré systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youxuan Wang, Rongning Liu, Feng Liu, Xueyang Song</p>
            <p>We compute universal electrical transport near continuous transitions between a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and a metallic phase in moire Chern bands, focusing on fillings $\nu=-1/2$ and $\nu=-3/4$. The critical theory represents a novel QED-Chern-Simons framework: a charged sector at a bosonic Laughlin-superfluid critical point is coupled, via emergent gauge fields and Chern-Simons mixing, to a neutral spinon Fermi surface. Integrating out matter fields to quadratic order yields an explicit Ioffe-Larkin composition rule for the full resistivity tensor, showing how longitudinal channels add in series while Chern-Simons terms generate Hall response. To obtain the DC limit in the quantum critical fan, we develop a controlled large-N expansion where both fermion flavors and Chern-Simons levels scale with $N$, and solve a quantum Boltzmann equation at leading nontrivial order $1/N$. Gauge-mediated inelastic scattering removes the collisionless Drude singularity and produces a universal scaling function $\Sigma(\omega/T)$ and finite DC conductivities $\sigma(0) \approx 0.033 e^2/\hbar$ ($\nu=-1/2$) and $0.047 e^2/\hbar$ ($\nu=-3/4$). We also identify a Chern-Simons "filtering" mechanism that suppresses transmission of Landau damping from the spinon Fermi surface to the critical gauge mode. Our approach provides concrete transport diagnostics for detecting quantum criticality in moire superlattices.</p>

            <p>Moiré semiconductors offer flat bands where Coulomb interactions and band topology intertwine, while interlayer coupling plays a central role in forming the moiré potential. However, limited interlayer coupling strength and the lack of efficient tuning methods hinder further exploration of correlated phenomena in moiré semiconductors. Here we introduce a cryogenic dual-gated diamond-anvil platform using helium as a pressure medium, enabling reversible hydrostatic tuning together with magneto-optical spectroscopy in twisted bilayer WSe2. Pressure enhances the moiré potential, redshifts excitons, and stabilizes Stoner ferromagnetism otherwise absent at a 3.1-degree twist. Simultaneously, the half-filled C = 1 Chern insulating state strengthens, exhibiting a reduced saturation field. Moreover, we observe a topological phase transition from a Chern insulator to a Mott insulator at around 2 GPa. First-principles calculations reveal that a Gamma-to-K valence-band-maximum switching drives this transition by converting an Ising-like topological K-valley miniband into a spin-degenerate trivial Gamma miniband. Our findings demonstrate hydrostatic pressure as a powerful, continuous control axis for correlated magnetism and topological band engineering in moiré materials.</p>

            <p>Consecutive topological phase transitions (TPTs) between strongly correlated electronic phases that differ simultaneously in symmetry breaking and topological order are of fundamental interest in condensed matter physics, yet are rarely realized experimentally. We report two consecutive electric-field-driven TPTs at half filling (nu = 1) in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moire heterobilayers. With increasing out-of-plane displacement field, a geometrically frustrated Mott insulator evolves into a ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) Mott insulator, i.e., a spin-polarized topological Mott insulator without an observable charge-gap closure, and subsequently into an antiferromagnetic, valley-coherent Mott insulator (VC-AFM) accompanied by a continuous charge-gap collapse and the emergence of a critical metallic state. Layer-resolved magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), magneto-transport, and compressibility measurements jointly determine the phase diagram. The high-field evolution of the antiferromagnetic state reveals a metamagnetic-like transition at a critical field B*, above which a Chern insulating transport response reappears. Our results establish the MoTe2/WSe2 moire platform as a tunable realization of an extended Kane-Mele-Hubbard model hosting sequential correlation-topology-intertwined transitions.</p>

            <p>We develop a microscopic theory of nonlinear magneto-optical injection currents in multi-Weyl semimetals subjected to a uniform magnetic field. Using the Landau-level spectrum of a tilted multi-Weyl Hamiltonian with arbitrary monopole charge $\nu$ as a starting point, we formulate a Kubo-type nonlinear response theory in the Landau-level basis and derive the second-order conductivity tensor. We identify distinct contributions originating from chiral-chiral, chiral-bulk, and bulk-bulk optical transitions, revealing characteristic monopole-charge scaling and sharp resonant structures governed by Landau-level selection rules and tilt-induced asymmetry. In the untilted limit, closed-form analytical expressions emerge that expose universal frequency thresholds and provide clear experimental signatures of higher-order Weyl topology. Our results establish nonlinear magneto-optical injection currents as a direct transport probe of chiral Landau levels and multi-Weyl topological charge.</p>

For a monolayer MoSe$_2$ on a SiO$_2$ substrate above 77$\,$K showing a bright-dark splitting in the meV range, the local electric field causes fast intravalley spin relaxation on a sub-picosecond timescale, whereas it is negligible for other TMDCs with larger bright-dark splitting.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets (AMs) - magnetic materials that have spin-split bandstructure with zero net spin polarization can be classified as weak or strong depending upon the strength of altermagnetic term in the Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two AMs in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities are analyzed as functions of angle $\theta$ between the Néel vectors of the two AMs. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta \to \pi$, while in the weak AM regime it remains finite. Introducing a normal metal (NM) between two AMs leads to Fabry-Pérot-type oscillations in charge conductivity which can be controlled by an applied gate voltage. In the strong regime, transport in AM-NM-AM junctions is dominated by up-spin electrons, whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak regime. These results highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be utilized in electronic devices without a need for externally applied magnetic field.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character - which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements - and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum's Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Probing near-field EM fluctuations in superparamagnetic CoFeB with NV quantum dephasometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoaib Mahmud, Wei Zhang, Pronoy Das, Angshuman Deka, Wenbo Sun, Zubin Jacob</p>
            <p>Superparamagnetism in nanoscale magnetic layers is a critical property for a wide range of spintronic-based sensor and computing applications. While conventional magnetization measurements can detect superparamagnetic signatures, they often require the application of high perturbative fields and are difficult to implement for magnetic layers integrated within functional devices. In this study, we non-invasively investigate the superparamagnetic spin dynamics of a nanoscale CoFeB layer of thickness 1.1 nm, deposited on a diamond substrate, by probing its low-frequency near-field electromagnetic (EM) fluctuations using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers-based quantum dephasometry. Our measurements reveal an unconventional, non-monotonic temperature dependence of the dephasing time of NV centers, which we attribute to EM fluctuations produced by thermally driven superparamagnetic domain flipping in CoFeB. Our findings are further supported by the theoretical interpretation of the dephasing dynamics of NV centers and the complementary SQUID-based magnetization characterizations of the CoFeB layer. Additionally, exploiting the technique of NV dephasometry, we extract the spectral density of the EM fluctuations in CoFeB, which is used to isolate different components of the EM fluctuations acting on NV centers. We also measure the CoFeB-to-NV distance-dependent coherence times of NV centers to investigate the effect of the dimensionality of the CoFeB layer on the generated near-field EM fluctuations. These results provide critical insight into the magnetization dynamics and near-field EM environment of nanoscale magnetic layers. It also has significant implications for the development of hybrid quantum spintronic devices and applications involving nanoscale opto-magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Simulating strongly correlated systems in two dimensions is notoriously challenging due to rapid entanglement growth and frustration. Here, we introduce the adaptive projected-purified pseudoboson density-matrix renormalization group (A3P-DMRG) tailored to explore the ground states of dilute lattice models. The method compresses cluster Hilbert spaces by retaining only the most probable low-occupation Fock states, identified via probabilistic bounds and refined through a self-consistent mean-field basis optimization. We demonstrate that A3P-DMRG is advantageous in low-filling and weak-coupling regimes for large system sizes where conventional DMRG struggles. This establishes the method as a versatile tool for studying dilute quantum many-body systems relevant to ultra-cold atom quantum simulators, photonic lattices, Moiré materials and quantum chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical metastability and transient topological magnons in interacting driven-dissipative magnetic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent P. Flynn, Lorenza Viola, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>Metastability, i.e., partial relaxation to long-lived, quasi-stationary states before true asymptotic equilibrium sets in, emerges ubiquitously in classical and quantum dynamical systems as a result of timescales separation. In open quantum systems, an intrinsically nonequilibrium analogue, dynamical metastability, can originate from the spectral geometry of a non-Hermitian operator. In noninteracting models, this mechanism produces boundary-sensitive anomalous relaxation, transient amplification, and topologically mandated long-lived edge modes, all of which are enhanced as system size grows. Here we extend dynamical metastability into the nonlinear, interacting regime and identify magnetic heterostructures as a natural platform for its exploration. We introduce an interacting spin Lindbladian whose linearized magnon dynamics map onto a dynamically metastable Hatano-Nelson chain, and show that dynamical metastability in the noninteracting limit seeds genuinely nonlinear phenomena, including size-dependent spin dipping and anomalous attraction to unstable equilibria. Long-lived edge states associated to topologically mandated Dirac bosons persist under nonlinearities and disorder. We further analyze the magnetization dynamics in magnetic multilayers within the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski framework, identifying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, nonlocal damping, and spin-transfer torque as control parameters governing bulk-boundary stability mismatch and band topology. While all the distinctive dynamical phenomena previously identified reappear in this experimentally relevant setting, the LLGS framework also supports multistability and limit cycles that are absent in the quantum model. Our results constitute the first systematic study of dynamical metastability in nonlinear dynamics, directly relevant to spin-torque oscillator arrays, magnonic devices, and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Exact dimer ground state and quantum phase transitions in a coupled spin ladder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manas Ranjan Mahapatra, Rakesh Kumar</p>
            <p>Spin ladders are key models that act as intermediaries between one-dimensional and two-dimensional spin systems. In this study, we examine a coupled spin-$1/2$ ladder, where frustrated ladders with leg, rung, and diagonal interactions are linked through a horizontal coupling. By introducing a spatially anisotropic third-nearest-neighbor interaction along the horizontal direction, the model was found to possess an exact dimer ground state, characterized by a product of singlets forming a columnar dimer phase. The model is analyzed using bond-operator mean-field theory (BOMFT) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). BOMFT reveals three distinct phases: a double-stripe ordered phase, a Néel ordered phase, and a quantum disordered dimerized phase. The critical points for the transitions are $J_1 = -0.81$ (double-stripe to dimerized) and $J_1 = 2.81$ (dimerized to Néel phase). DMRG results corroborate the exact ground state and refine the critical points to $J_1 = -0.79$ and $J_1 = 2.29$ for the respective transitions. Additionally, another transition is identified as the Néel order vanishes for $J_1 > 4.5$. The static spin structure factor further corroborates the nature of the ordered phases.</p>

By exciting trions in two-dimensional tungsten-diselenide donors and transferring them into one-dimensional carbon-nanotube acceptors in mixed-dimensional heterostructures, we circumvent the usual carrier requirement, overcoming intrinsic Auger-quenching limitations. Benefitting from a reservoir effect induced by dimensional heterogeneity, this process achieves trion emission efficiencies increased by over 100-fold compared to conventional doping-based approaches, and remains robust across diverse doping conditions. Our findings extend the exciton transfer paradigm to the three-body quasiparticles, offering a new platform for advancing excitonic physics and trion-based optoelectronic/spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Compressed hydrides are promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity, yet achieving simultaneous structural stability and high-Tc at low pressures remains challenging. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for accomplishing this goal by mimicking the bonding characteristics of high-pressure H3S within metal hydrides. Using Li3CuH4 as an example, its Cu-H covalent interaction effectively mimics the core function of the S-H bonding in H3S. This interaction not only induces a high hydrogen-derived electronic density of states at the Fermi level, but also softens the hydrogen phonon modes, thereby significantly enhancing the electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, embedding the strongly ionic Li3H lattice into the covalent Cu-H framework stabilizes the structure at significantly low pressures via a chemical-template effect, while maintaining high-Tc. Li3CuH4 exhibits excellent thermodynamic stability at 20 GPa, with a Tc of 39.25 K at 12 GPa. Further comprehensive high-throughput studies on Li3MH4 (M = transition metal) compounds uncover general principles applicable to a broader range of compounds. This work establishes a new paradigm for the simultaneous optimization of the stability and high-temperature superconductivity of metal hydrides through complementary sublattice interactions, thus advancing the search for practical and viable superconducting materials.</p>

            <p>The evolution of magnetic correlation in strongly correlated electron systems with altermagentic spin splitting remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate how spin splitting generated by spin-dependent next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$ reshapes the Fermi surface nesting and van Hove singularities in the two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model, leading evolution of magnetic instabilities. Using the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method, we find the dominant magnetic correlation as functions of the filling and $t'/t$ by computing the momentum-resolved spin structure factor. The analysis reveals a transition from antiferromagnetic $(\pi,\pi)$ order in the isotropic, half-filled system to non-collinear spiral $(\pi,q)$ order upon increasing the spin-dependent anisotropy or doping away from half-filling, ultimately entering a short-range correlation regime where stripe and spiral correlation coexist. These findings highlight a possible route to realizing spiral correlation in altermagnetic systems, potentially providing a platform for spintronic devices that exploit non-collinear spin textures.</p>

            <p>Unidirectional magnetoresistance, or electric magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), is a nonlinear magnetotransport phenomenon that arises in noncentrosymmetric conductors , where changes in resistance $R(B)$ are: (i) chiral, $\Delta R(B)/R(0)=2\,\chi\, {\bf I}\cdot{\bf B}$, or (ii) polar, $\Delta R(B)/R(0)=2\,\gamma\, {\bf I}\cdot({\bf P}\times{\bf B})$, with eMChA coefficients $\chi$ and $\gamma$. In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 106602 (2025)], we showed that the eMChA in the conduction band of tellurene is polar ($\chi=0$, $\gamma\neq 0$) and emerges from the quantum metric dipole due to its Weyl node and from the lone pair polarization ${\bf P}$. Here, we extend our work to the valence band of tellurene, where the eMChA is usually said to be chiral ($\chi \neq 0, \gamma = 0$). We show that also a polar coefficient $\gamma \neq 0$ emerges naturally through a downfolding procedure, in which remote Weyl-node containing bands induce momentum-space gradients of the quantum metric in the low-energy levels, activating finite metric dipoles. Combining semiclassical Boltzmann transport with a ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ description of tellurene, our numerical calculations agree quantitatively with doping ($\mu$) dependent second-harmonic measurements of the longitudinal voltage $V^{2\omega}_\parallel(\mu)$ in perpendicular field. The combined chiral and polar characters ($\chi\neq0, \gamma\neq 0)$ of the eMChA in tellurene also explains the shift in the angular ($\phi$) dependence of $V^{2\omega}_\parallel(\phi)$ for in plane fields. Our results demonstrate that the polar eMChA can arise in topologically trivial bands through multiband effects and establishes tellurene as a platform for quantum-geometric rectification in both electron and hole regimes.</p>

            <p>Strong correlation, when combined with dissipation in open systems, can lead to a variety of exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we study nontrivial interplays between non-Fermi liquid behaviors emerging from strong correlation and non-Hermiticity arising from open systems.

We identify a weak-coupling local moment fixed point and a strong-coupling non-Fermi liquid fixed point under PT symmetry, both are enriched by the non-Hermitian effect. Remarkably, universal unconventional Kondo conductance behaviors are found for both cases, which are distinct from all previously studied Kondo systems. Particularly, we show that an anomalous upturn of conductance could take place with increasing the temperature, originating from the interplay between non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermiticity. Our results identify a novel class of transport phenomena unrecognized before, driven by intertwined effects of correlation and dissipation.</p>

            <p>Overheating is a critical bottleneck limiting the performance and reliability of next-generation high-power and high-frequency electronics. Interfacial thermal resistance constitutes a significant portion of the total thermal resistance. In this study, we report an ultrahigh thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of approximately 800 MW/m2-K at the atomically-sharp AlN-SiC interface, achieved through an ion implantation-enhanced nucleation epitaxy technique. This value is among the highest TBC values reported for semiconductor interfaces, confirmed by structural characterizations which show an ultrahigh-quality interface. Atomistic Green Function calculations reveal that elastic phonon transmission dominates the interface, with nearly half of the acoustic modes (0-15 THz) exhibiting near-unity transmission due to the atomically sharp structure. Furthermore, using high-energy-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we probe vibrational properties with nanometer spatial resolution and identify unique interfacial phonon modes connecting the mismatched phonon spectra, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The ultrahigh TBC is attributed to both the high elastic phonon transmission due to the high quality interfaces and the inelastic phonon scattering channel due to interfacial phonon modes. These findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of interfacial thermal transport but also provide a pathway for effective thermal management in emerging electronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksey Vlasov, Pavel Golovinski</p>
            <p>This paper considers the propagation of excitons in linear chains of QDs with a side defect, located on a dielectric substrate. This configuration is suitable for spatially selective excitation of the system by pulsed optical radiation through the side defect. The dynamics of excitation in the chain is governed by structural disorder, caused by technological variations in the parameters of the QDs themselves and their mutual arrangement. To describe the quantum properties of excitons in the QD chain, a model Hamiltonian is used, taking into account the coupling of neighboring QDs due to dipole-dipole interaction. The localization of stationary states is calculated depending on the magnitude of disorder and the chain length. A criterion is introduced that determines the boundaries of the phase transition from the localized to the delocalized excitation phase. The dynamics of exciton transfer along the QD chain is calculated depending on its length and degree of disorder for linear excitation of the system by a laser pulse. It is shown that dynamic localization emerging in the system corresponds to the stationary localization properties of the states of the chain with a side defect.</p>

Strikingly, the relaxation shape of the probe molecules in dilution is indistinguishable from that of the pure liquid composed of the probe molecules. By contrast, when explicit dynamic heterogeneity is introduced, e.g., through internal degrees of freedom or a distribution of probe molecule sizes, the relaxation shape becomes sensitive to the solvent concentration. These findings indicate that dynamic heterogeneity has a negligible influence on the rotational dynamics of single component van der Waals liquids above the melting point, despite the pronounced non-exponential character of their relaxation shape.</p>

            <p>Metastable cubic tin(II) sulfide ($\pi$-SnS) is an earth-abundant semiconductor whose three-dimensionally bonded chiral lattice may overcome the short minority-carrier lifetime of orthorhombic SnS while maintaining a near-ideal bandgap for tandem photovoltaics. Despite its promise, ultrafast carrier cooling and recombination mechanisms over illumination density remain poorly constrained. We use core-level extreme-ultraviolet attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy at the Sn $4d$ edge to track carrier injection, cooling, and recombination in $\pi$-SnS with element- and orbital-specific sensitivity. Following femtosecond near-infrared excitation, the Sn $4d\rightarrow$CB onset exhibits conduction-band state filling and a carrier-induced edge shift, enabling extraction of density-dependent kinetics. The transient response follows a biexponential decay with a fast hot-carrier cooling component and a slower recombination component. At low carrier densities, recombination is consistent with interface-limited processes, whereas above $\sim1\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ both cooling and recombination accelerate, indicating a crossover to carrier-carrier interaction-dominated dynamics. Coherent phonon oscillations with a period of $\sim188$ fs reveal coupling between electronic excitation and lattice motion. These results provide a comprehensive picture of nonequilibrium carrier and phonon dynamics in cubic SnS, reveal a change of mechanisms over a range of carrier densities, and establish the value of using attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to study ultrafast processes in complex semiconductors that have optoelectronic and energy-conversion applications.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning-integrated Multiscale Simulation Framework: Bridging Scales in Associative Polymer-Colloid Suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jalal Abdolahi, Dominic M. Robe, Ronald G. Larson, Elnaz Hajizadeh</p>
            <p>Predicting the rheological behavior of associative polymers bridging colloidal particles into transient networks is fundamentally challenging because the coupled spatiotemporal scales prevent efficient molecular-fidelity modeling. We address this through a novel, unified multiscale simulation framework for telechelic polymer-colloid suspensions integrating: explicit-chain Brownian dynamics resolving polymer-particle association kinetics; active learning metamodels compressing kinetics into efficient surrogates; and Population Balance-Brownian Dynamics (Pop-BD) computing network-scale dynamics from metamodel predictions. Validated against explicit-chain Brownian dynamics, our framework accurately reproduces time-and frequency-dependent stress relaxation moduli, enabling simulations of larger systems over longer timescales. Systematic investigations reveal that network connectivity exhibits critical transitions at specific chain-to-particle ratios, with bond density and lifetime correlating to enhanced relaxation times and moduli. Higher particle volume fractions yield more persistent bonds and slower relaxation. This framework connects chain-level dynamics to macroscopic rheology, enabling computationally efficient rational design of associative colloidal materials for waterborne coatings and soft-matter applications.</p>

            <h2>Bulk-boundary correspondence in topological two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems: Toeplitz operators and singular values</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Sirker</p>
            <p>In contrast to eigenvalue-based approaches, we formulate the bulk-boundary correspondence for two-dimensional non-Hermitian quadratic lattice Hamiltonians in terms of Toeplitz operators and singular values, which correctly capture the stability, localization, and scaling of edge and corner modes. We show that singular values, rather than eigenvalues, provide the only stable foundation for topological protection in non-Hermitian systems because they remain robust under translational-symmetry-breaking perturbations that destabilize the eigenvalue spectrum, rendering it unsuitable for topological classification. Building on Toeplitz operator theory, we establish general results for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians defined on half and quarter planes, relating the topological indices of the associated Toeplitz operators to the number of finite-size singular values that are separated from the bulk singular-value spectrum and vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This yields a precise bulk-boundary correspondence for edge and corner modes, including higher-order topological phases, without requiring crystalline symmetries. We illustrate our general results with detailed examples exhibiting topologically protected families of edge states, coexisting edge and corner modes, and phases with both gapped bulk and edges supporting only stable corner modes. The latter is exemplified by a non-Hermitian generalization of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnets typically host spin-wave (magnon) excitations in the terahertz (THz) regime, offering a promising platform for high-speed magnonic information technologies. Harnessing these excitations requires sensitive control of their spectral properties. Here we use resonant x-ray diffraction and Raman scattering to demonstrate uniaxial-strain control of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state and THz magnon excitations in the layered Mott insulator Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Although the states separated by the strain-induced phase transition differ only by the sign of the weak and partially frustrated interlayer interaction, their magnon energies differ by more than 10% (~ 0.3 THz). Our theoretical analysis explains this surprising observation by tracing the origin of both the sign reversal of the interlayer coupling and the magnon energy to the spin-orbital composition of the Ru valence electrons. The extreme strain sensitivity of the THz magnon energy near a magnetic phase transition opens up pathways towards a new generation of transition-edge magnonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. Pankaj, Sandeep Sugathan, Si Joon Kim, Pil-Ryung Cha</p>
            <p>Polycrystalline hafnia-based thin films exhibit mixed ferroelectric (FE), antiferroelectric (AFE), and dielectric (DE) behavior, with switching characteristics strongly influenced by microstructure and phase distribution. Here, we develop a unified grain-resolved three-dimensional phase-field framework for metal-insulator-metal capacitors that simultaneously captures ferroic phase characteristics in realistic polycrystalline microstructures by explicitly incorporating grain topology and crystallographic orientation. Antipolar sublattice kinetics are represented via the coupled evolution of macroscopic and staggered polarization order parameters. All thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are calibrated to experimental P-E hysteresis loops and held fixed across all simulations. The results show that phase fractions primarily determine hysteresis character, while vertical segregation of AFE- and FE-rich regions systematically reduces the effective coercive field (Ec) under identical electrical loading. Grain-resolved analysis reveals that this reduction arises from microstructure-assisted switching pathways and electrostatic coupling between layers. These findings demonstrate that vertical phase arrangement provides a viable strategy to engineer switching behavior in hafnia-based ferroic capacitors and highlight the importance of explicit microstructural resolution for quantitative phase-field modeling.</p>

            <h2>Phason-Driven Diversity of Nucleation Pathways in Icosahedral Quasicrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Cui, Lei Zhang, Pingwen Zhang, An-Chang Shi, Kai Jiang</p>
            <p>The nucleation of quasicrystals remains a fundamental puzzle, primarily due to the absence of a periodic translational template. Here, we demonstrate that phasons - hidden degrees of freedom unique to quasiperiodic order - drive diverse nucleation pathways in icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs). Combining a Landau free-energy model with the spring pair method, we compute distinct critical nuclei and their corresponding minimum energy paths. At low temperatures, a direct, symmetry-preserving pathway dominates. In contrast, higher temperatures promote a "symmetry detour" that reduces the nucleation barrier via a lower-symmetry critical nucleus. Remarkably, while the resulting bulk IQCs exhibit distinct real-space symmetries, they remain thermodynamically degenerate with identical diffraction patterns. We resolve this paradox within the high-dimensional projection framework, showing that phason shifts modulate real-space symmetry without altering bulk thermodynamics. Our findings establish phasons as the structural origin of pathway diversity, offering a new physical picture for the emergence of quasiperiodic order.</p>

            <p>The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond exists in different charge states with distinct photoluminescence properties, which are sensitive to the nanoscale electrochemical environment. Hence, the NV charge state is emerging as a powerful all-optical platform for nanoscale sensing and imaging. Although significant progress has been made in engineering near-surface NV centers in bulk diamond, controlling the NV charge state in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has proven challenging, limiting the sensitivity and reliability of FND-based charge state sensing. Here, we demonstrate reliable, reversible switching between the fluorescent NV$^0$ and non-fluorescent NV$^+$ charge states in sub-30 nm FNDs via surface oxidation and hydrogenation, respectively, for single particles and particle powder. In aqueous electrochemical cells, we demonstrate voltage and ion concentration imaging based on the NV charge state in self-assembled FND layers on transparent substrates. Applied voltages reliably modulate the FND PL with a sensitivity of up to 16 mV Hz$^{-1/2}$. Importantly, FND PL is also modulated by local changes in salt concentration with a sensitivity of up to 1.8% per millimolar NaCl, enabling all-optical imaging of ion concentration gradients at the microscale. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing fast, stable, and scalable nanoscale charge- and voltage-imaging technologies with sub-micrometer spatial resolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi-Bo Zeng, Rong Lü</p>
            <p>The interplay of topology, disorder, and non-Hermiticity gives rise to phenomena beyond the conventional classification of quantum phases. We propose a one-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with quasiperiodically modulated nonreciprocal intracell hopping. We show that quasiperiodic modulation can substantially enhance topological robustness and, remarkably, induce a non-Hermitian topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phase. Beyond the topological transition, increasing nonreciprocity drives a cascade of localization transitions in which all bulk eigenstates evolve from extended to multifractal critical and ultimately to localized states. Strikingly, the extended-to-critical transition coincides exactly with a real-complex spectral transition. We establish complete phase diagrams and derive exact analytical boundaries for both topological and localization transitions, uncovering an unanticipated coexistence of TAI and multifractal critical phases. Finally, we propose a feasible implementation in topolectrical circuits. Our results reveal a new paradigm for the cooperative effects of topology, quasiperiodicity, and non-Hermiticity.</p>

A fabricated SrIrO3/La-BiFeO3/SrIrO3 trilayer exhibits sub-100 ps switching, a remnant polarization of 20 uC/cm2, and a readout voltage contrast close to 1mV between high and low-resistance states. To connect device physics to circuit behavior, we develop and experimentally validate a compact circuit model that captures spin Hall injection and spin transport. Simulations with optimized material parameters predict output voltages > 100mV, enabling cascading without external amplification. Using this framework, we design MEMM-based memory and logic blocks, including a 1T1R array, two inverter implementations (complementary two-device and single-device), and a three-input majority gate, and evaluate deep-pipelined operation. The model projects switching energies down to 1 aJ per operation and logic propagation delays of 30-60 ps, indicating MEMM as a promising platform for energy-constrained, high throughput computing.</p>

The interaction-enabled EP2s are protected by zero-dimensional topology and give rise to qualitative changes in the loss rate, an experimentally measurable quantity for cold atoms. Furthermore, we reveal that interactions enable EP3s protected by one-dimensional topology beyond the point-gap topological classifications, suggesting the potential presence of a broader class of interaction-enabled non-Hermitian degeneracies.</p>

Under magnetic fields above 3T, TN splits into TN1 and TN2, which correspond to the transitions from the paramagnetic phase to the up-up-down (uud) phase and from the uud phase to the triangular coplanar phase, respectively. The NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 exhibits a critical divergence at TN1, indicating the onset of long-range magnetic order. At TN2, the NMR-linewidth measured at 5.4 T exhibits an anomalous decrease, which we attribute to a change in the spin structure from the uud to the triangular coplanar phase.</p>

            <p>Non-fullerene acceptors (NFA), such as Y6, have significantly improved the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). However, the fundamental processes behind the high efficiencies of NFA devices have remained incompletely understood, with the high efficiencies persisting without the large energetic offsets often thought to be required for charge separation. Even more surprising has been the efficient charge generation in neat Y6 devices, where there is no energetic offset at all. Here, we simulate charge transport and separation in Y6 using delocalised kinetic Monte Carlo (dKMC) parameterised using atomistic calculations, thus taking into account the often-neglected ingredients of delocalisation, disorder, and polaron formation. Including delocalisation predicts higher carrier mobilities and exciton diffusion coefficients than is possible with classical simulations, bringing them into agreement with experimental values. Delocalisation also predicts higher charge-generation efficiencies in neat Y6, in agreement with experimental measurements. Finally, this work establishes dKMC as a realistic, predictive tool for understanding next-generation OPVs.</p>

            <p>Controlling nonlinear effects in micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems is essential for unlocking their full potential in sensing, signal processing, and frequency control. In this study, we develop a voltage-dependent Hamiltonian framework for a nanoelectromechanical resonator with two strongly coupled vibrational modes, representative of a nanostring platform. The mode frequencies and couplings of the system are tuned electrostatically using a DC voltage, which also controls the strength of the interactions. Our theoretical model reproduces the experimentally observed avoided crossing in the absence of an AC drive and generates tunable frequency-comb spectra when a parametric drive is applied. By scanning the DC voltage, we generate a phase diagram that links comb formation and sharp regime boundaries to underlying bifurcations, multi-stability, and attractor switching. Phase-resolved diagnostics based on a Kuramoto order parameter, together with autocorrelation and Poincaré analyses, quantify coherence and critical slowing down near these transitions. We further explore the relationship between nonlinear coupling, parametric excitation, and stability transitions within a single device of experimental relevance and establish a dynamical framework for engineering nanoelectromechanical resonators that offer enhanced tunability, functionality, and a predictive link to experimental outcomes.</p>

            <p>We present a first-principles investigation of magnetic exchange interactions and critical behavior in (111)-oriented (LaMnO$_3$)$_{2n}$|(SrMnO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices for $n=2,4,6$. For all superlattices under investigation, we find robust half-metallic ferromagnetism extending across all the layers of both component regions. Changing octahedral tilt patterns is found to have negligible effects on the magnetic properties, despite determining the presence or absence of small Jahn-Teller distortions. The analysis of the response of the magnetic coupling to a variation of the Coulomb interaction parameters demonstrates that ferromagnetism is driven by a double-exchange mechanism involving itinerant $e_g$ electrons, while its final strength is hampered by antiferromagnetic contributions due to the superexchange of localized $t_{2g}$ electrons. Multi-scale simulations based on atomistic spin dynamics show that the thinnest superlattices, $n=2,4$, possess an ordering temperature that is at least comparable to that of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$. Conversely, as thickness increases, a two-phase behavior emerges, where the SrMnO$_3$ region loses long-range order faster than the LaMnO$_3$ region. While the global ordering temperature increases together with thickness, we argue that the high-temperature regime for the observed two-phase behavior is not representative of the real physical system, which will undergo a combined electronic, magnetic and structural phase transition as soon as the long-range order is lost inside the SrMnO$_3$ region. This study provides insights into the emergent magnetic phases and transition temperatures relevant to oxide heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in porous carbon materials has highlighted the importance of structural design in controlling emergent physicochemical properties. In this context, hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY), a three-dimensional framework derived from graphdiyne (GDY), has recently emerged as a promising architecture whose stacking-dependent behavior remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of HsGDY across distinct stacking sequences. Our results identify the AA and ABC configurations as the most energetically favorable, with AA corresponding to the global minimum, consistent with recent experimental observations. Electronic-structure analysis reveals that HsGDY is an indirect semiconductor with an electronic band gap of 0.89 eV (optB88-vdW), primarily governed by interlayer coupling and van der Waals interactions. The optical response exhibits pronounced absorption features spanning the visible to ultraviolet regions, highlighting strong potential for optoelectronic applications. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 700 K confirm the thermal robustness of the framework, with negligible structural distortions. Collectively, these findings elucidate the stacking-dependent stability and semiconducting character of HsGDY, providing a solid theoretical foundation for its integration into next-generation nanoelectronic and energy-harvesting technologies.</p>

Under an applied electric field, these materials undergo a volatile insulator-to-metal transition characterized by the formation of percolating metallic filaments within an insulating bulk. Using numerical simulations based on the Mott resistor network, we demonstrate that defect-induced modifications to filament nucleation and stability drive these devices into stochastic oscillatory regimes.

            <p>We study caging/trapping in Sokoban-type models, featuring a random walker moving through a disordered medium of obstacles and capable of pushing some obstacles blocking its path. In one-dimension, we allow the walker to push up to an arbitrary $N_{\rm P}$ number of obstacles. For $N_{\rm P}\gg 1$, we use large-deviation theory to show that the survival probability to remain uncaged exhibits crossover from an exponential decay with time at intermediate times to a stretched-exponential decay at long times, with an exponent $1/3$ independent of $N_{\rm P}$. The long-time exponent matches the Balagurov--Vaks--Donsker--Varadhan (BVDV) theory of the classical trapping problem, while the exponential decay is qualitatively distinct from the Rosenstock's intermediate-time theory for classical trapping. Similarly, in two dimensions, numerical simulations reveal that both the Sokoban model and its generalized version exhibit long-time stretched-exponential relaxation with exponent $1/2$, again consistent with the BVDV theory. Finally, in two dimensions, we find that the mean trap size is nonmonotonic in $\rho$: it is small at both low and high densities, but reaches a peak at a characteristic density $\rho_*$. We estimate $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ for the Sokoban model and $\rho_* \approx 0.675$ for the generalized Sokoban model.</p>

            <h2>Composite Boson Theory of Fractional Chern Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyu Yu, Zheng Zhu</p>
            <p>The understanding of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has been deeply guided by band topology and quantum geometry. Here, we introduce a real-space theoretical framework in which FCIs are understood in terms of composite bosons, local objects consisting of electrons bound to their energetically excluded surrounding orbitals. The central element of our framework is the construction of a radially ordered set of maximally localized basis for Chern bands without requiring continuous rotational symmetry. Within this basis, the complex many-body problem simplifies to a real-space organizing principle: a stable FCI occurs if the orbitals excluded around central electrons are those maximizing the two-body interaction energy. We validate this with direct numerical evidence for composite boson formation in the Haldane model, demonstrating that our criterion reliably characterizes FCIs. Importantly, our analysis illustrates that the composite boson framework bridges the fractional quantum Hall effect in continuum and lattice paradigms, providing a unified and intuitive real-space interpretation for distinct correlated phases. It thus establishes a foundation for diagnosing and guiding the design of both Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered phases across distinct platforms.</p>

Furthermore, we propose an experiment where a distinct scaling with a varying displacement field is predicted for an intralayer spin-singlet order in a bilayer. The scaling of the upper critical field with external tuning parameters can thus be used to extract information about the spin-symmetry of the superconducting order. We also explore the possibility of a mixed-parity spin-singlet and -triplet order parameter. In that case, we predict that the experimentally observable scaling would remain that of the spin-singlet component.</p>

A gas of $3 \times 10^5$ ytterbium atoms at a temperature of $340\,$nK is transported over $34\,$cm in $350\,$ms with efficiency over $60\%$. Furthermore, a degenerate gas of $1 \times 10^5$ atoms with a $40\%$ condensate fraction emerges from the phase synchronization process driven by atomic interactions. This demonstration enables the fast preparation of ultracold atomic beams and large-scale atom arrays for quantum sensing, simulation and computing.</p>

            <h2>Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongbo Deng, Jan G. Korvink</p>
            <p>Geometry design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors. Topology optimization is one of the most powerful approaches used to determine structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of both low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kushal Patel, Kesavaraja C, Pranab Dutta, Korak Biswas</p>
            <p>In this work, we report the development of a rubidium-based single-beam scalar optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) and demonstrate its application in measuring human cardiac magnetic fields in an unshielded environment. The developed magnetometers exhibit a noise floor below 15 pT/sqrt(Hz) in the frequency range of 1 to 35 Hz, with a measurement bandwidth of 100 Hz. When operated in a gradiometric configuration, the noise floor is further reduced to below 3 pT/sqrt(Hz) over the same frequency range. Magnetocardiography (MCG) signals were recorded at five different locations across the thorax. A clear polarity reversal of the QRS complex was observed across these measurement positions, confirming the spatial sensitivity of the system. The proposed system shows strong potential for clinical diagnostics, offering valuable physiological information through non-contact MCG measurements</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of mechanical properties of graphene oxide fibers via liquid crystalline phase formation and flake size optimization</h2>

            <p>Graphene oxide (GO) fibers are promising materials for lightweight, high-strength applications due to their unique structural tunability and mechanical performance. However, the properties of GO fibers strongly depend on the ordering of GO flakes during the assembly process. In this work, we demonstrate that GO fibers spun from a liquid crystalline (LC) GO dispersion exhibit significantly enhanced mechanical properties compared to those produced from non-LC GO dispersions. The improved tensile strength is attributed to the larger GO flake size and highly ordered alignment achieved in the LC phase. The LC-derived fibers demonstrated a Young's modulus of 12.3 GPa, a tensile strength of 146.8 MPa, and an elongation at break of 2.5%. These findings emphasize the critical role of flake size and LC ordering in enhancing the performance of GO-based fibers and suggest a straightforward pathway toward scalable fabrication of strong yet flexible carbon-based materials.</p>

            <p>Propagation of short pulses through Cu$_2$O crystal containing Rydberg excitons is studied with the use of density matrix formalism and FDTD method. Saturation effects related to the so-called Rydberg blockade are studied extensively, exploring not only reduction of absorption (bleaching) but also power-dependent changes of the dispersive properties of the medium. The role of exciton lifetime and coherent population oscillations in the dynamics of the system is investigated. A pump-probe setup with two pulses is also studied, showing good agreement with recent experimental studies.</p>

            <p>We experimentally investigate a frustrated spin-exchange antiferromagnet in a quantum simulator, composed of N = 114 dipolar Rydberg atoms arranged into a kagome array. Motivated by a recent theoretical proposal of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state, we use local addressing to adiabatically prepare low-energy states. We measure the local polarization and spin-spin correlations over this adiabatic protocol, and observe our system move from a staggered product state, through an intermediate magnetic crystal, and finally into a disordered, correlated liquid. We estimate the entropy density of this atomic liquid to be similar to that of frustrated magnetic insulators at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We compare the correlations in our liquid to those of a simple, parameter-free ansatz for the Dirac spin liquid, and find good agreement in the sign structure and spatial decay. Finally, we probe the static susceptibility of our system to a local field perturbation and to a geometrical distortion. Our results establish Rydberg atom arrays as a promising platform for the preparation and microscopic characterization of quantum spin liquid candidates.</p>

            <p>Neuromorphic computing aims to reproduce the energy efficiency and adaptability of biological intelligence in hardware. Superconducting devices are an attractive platform due to their ultra-low dissipation and fast switching dynamics. Here we introduce a shunted superconducting wirelet as an artificial neuron, representing the simplest possible superconducting neuron implementation. This minimal design, a single superconducting channel with a resistive shunt, enables straightforward fabrication, electronic control, and high scalability. The neuron exhibits spiking voltage behavior driven by the interplay of resistive switching and relaxation, with key properties such as threshold, firing frequency, and refractory time tunable via applied current, temperature, and shunt resistance. We further show that the resulting temporal voltage signals can be incorporated into a training algorithm to achieve accurate pattern recognition, demonstrating suitability for neuromorphic tasks. Finally, we discuss on-chip training using similar wirelets with gated synaptic weights, establishing a scalable, energy-efficient building block for cryogenic artificial intelligence hardware, integrable with other emergent superconducting technologies.</p>

            <p>Experiments at extreme strain rates and temperatures are critical for characterizing materials in high-speed applications. In this study, we develop a laser-driven particle impact platform capable of accelerating microparticles to supersonic velocities and impacting targets heated to temperatures approaching 2000 °C. The conventional laser-induced particle impact testing (LIPIT) system has been modified to enable high-temperature experiments through the integration of a resistive heating system and the development of a robust launch pad assembly suitable for accelerating particles in high-temperature environments. To eliminate the oxidation of materials at elevated temperatures, an optically accessible portable vacuum chamber has been developed and integrated into the setup. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated through a study of the temperature dependent particle impact cratering behavior of POCO graphite. With this new platform, high-velocity, high-temperature impact experiments can be performed in a controlled environment, supporting the investigation of materials under extreme conditions.</p>

            <h2>Probing atom-surface interactions from tunneling-time measurements via rotation-transport on an atom chip</h2>

            <p>We propose a novel method to measure the interaction between an ultracold gas of neutral atoms and a surface. This solution combines an optical dipole trap reflected by the surface, a magnetic trap formed by current carrying wires embedded below the surface, and a rotation of the surface itself. It allows to adiabatically transport a $^{87}$Rb BEC from few $\mu$m to few hundred nm of the surface. At such distances, atom-surface interaction strongly affects the trapping potential, causing an increase of the tunneling rate towards the surface. In this paper, we show that the measurement of the lifetime of the cloud and its comparison to a tunneling model will allow to extract the Casimir-Polder (CP) force coefficient in the retarded regime ($c_4$). Our model includes noise-induced heating, calibration biases of experimentally controlled parameters and accuracy of the atom lifetime measurement. Using typical trapping parameters and experimental uncertainties, we numerically estimate the relative uncertainty of $c_4$ to be 10%. This method can be implemented with any atomic species that can be magnetically and optically trapped.</p>

            <h2>Dislocation dynamics on deformable surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcello De Donno, Luiza Angheluta, Marco Salvalaglio</p>
            <p>We develop a fully coupled theoretical description of dislocation dynamics on deformable crystalline surfaces, using continuum modeling and the amplitude-phase-field crystal (APFC) framework extended to curved geometries. We derive a general kinematic expression for dislocation velocity directly from the complex-amplitude evolution equations, which is also applicable to deformed surfaces through curvature-modified differential operators. From numerical simulations, we show that even small out-of-plane deformations reshape the phenomenology of defect motion through curvature-induced self-propulsion, modified glide directions, and non-classical defect-defect interactions. Our results show how surface geometry profoundly influences defect dynamics and establish the surface-APFC model as a powerful framework for predicting and interpreting curvature-defect coupling across a wide range of systems, from stiff but deformable layers to soft matter surfaces and membranes that retain crystalline order.</p>

            <p>Polymer brushes and grafted polymers have attracted significant interest at the intersection of polymers, interfacial chemistry, colloidal science, and nanostructuring. The confinement of high-density grafted polymers and differences in swelling regimes govern the synthetic challenges and the interesting physics underlying their macromolecular dynamics. In this article, we focus on another intersection, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), and how workflows will enhance the microstructure and composition of these systems. It will also accelerate potential applications through high-throughput experimentation (HTE) and data-driven intelligence, enabling scientific discovery and optimization. Applications in microfluidics, sensors, bioimplants, drug delivery, and related areas may yet offer more opportunities for ML-driven optimization. There is also interest in applying these studies with self-driving laboratories (SDLs) that can leverage autonomous systems for synthesis screening, characterization, and application evaluation.</p>

            <h2>Ilmenite-Type Ca$_x$IrO$_3$ via Topochemical Ion Exchange: Stacking Faults and Low-Temperature Magnetic Anomaly</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruki Kira, Yuya Haraguchi, Wataru Yokoshima, Daisuke Nishio-Hamane, Hiroko Aruga Katori</p>
            <p>We report the synthesis of an ilmenite-type polymorph of Ca$_x$IrO$_3$ distinct from the known post-perovskite and perovskite phases, via low-temperature topochemical Ca$^{2+}$/2Na$^+$ exchange from Na$_2$IrO$_3$. Powder X-ray diffraction is indexable in $R\bar{3}$, and whole pattern modelling that includes layer glide faults indicates that the selective broadening can be captured by a first order Markov stacking description based on stochastic switching between two symmetry equivalent lateral stacking steps, with explicit model dependence and an uncertainty of at least several percent. A freezing-like bulk magnetic anomaly is suggested at $T^* \sim 25$ K (defined by the onset of a ZFC/FC bifurcation at $\mu_{0}H = 10$ mT), accompanied by a broad heat capacity feature and Curie-Weiss behavior with a large negative Weiss temperature of $\theta_W \sim -98$ K. The effective moment $\mu_{\rm eff} = 1.68 \mu_{\rm B}$ per Ir is consistent with $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ for an Ir$^{4+}$. SEM-EDX suggests an A-site content below unity (Ca/Ir $<$ 1); accordingly, we describe the ion-exchanged product using the nonstoichiometric formula Ca$_x$IrO$_3$. These results identify ilmenite-type CaIrO$_3$ as a honeycomb iridate in which stacking disorder can be quantified (with caveats regarding model and instrument correlations) and related to its low-temperature magnetic behavior.</p>

M-CODE classifies structures by dimensionality, structural complexity (from pristine to compound pristine, defective, and processed), and variants that capture common structure creation and evolution approaches. A practical implementation of the categorization is provided in an open-source codebase that includes JSON schemas, examples, and Python and TypeScript types/interfaces, designed to support reproducible dataset generation, validation, and community contributions.</p>

            <p>FeTe is a prototypical parent compound of iron-based superconductors. While bulk FeTe is non-superconducting with a long-range bicollinear antiferromagnetic order, superconductivity has been achieved in thin films. However, the approaches usually involve complex oxygen incorporation or interfacial effects, the microscopic mechanisms of which remain elusive. Here, we prepare high-purity, bare FeTe thin films on SrTiO3 and investigate their magnetic and superconducting states combining both microscopic and macroscopic characterizations. By reducing the interstitial Fe impurities, we successfully suppress the long-range antiferromagnetic order, enhance the quasiparticle coherence and induce superconductivity at ~10 K. Moreover, this process is readily reversible by tuning the Fe concentration. Our findings reveal that precise stoichiometric control is sufficient to induce intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films. This work provides insights into the competition between magnetism and superconductivity in iron chalcogenides, and supplies a robust pathway for developing stable, high-purity superconducting FeTe films.</p>

            <h2>Programming active-molecule dynamics via intramolecular nonreciprocity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye Zhang, Meng Xiao, Duanduan Wan</p>
            <p>The dynamics of a self-propelled particle are typically hard-wired by its microscopic construction, limiting the range of behaviors accessible without redesigning the particle itself. Here we show that intramolecular nonreciprocity provides a minimal and versatile mechanism to overcome this constraint. We construct active molecules from short chains of two species of self-propelled particles whose propulsion directions are coupled nonreciprocally according to a prescribed internal sequence. At the single-molecule level, homogeneous sequences exhibit standard persistent random-walk dynamics, whereas heterogeneous sequences produce distinct trajectories inaccessible to either constituent species alone. At the collective level, using motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) as a representative example, we find that modifying the internal sequence shifts the MIPS onset by multiple orders of magnitude in propulsion strength, without altering particle-level interactions. These results demonstrate that intramolecular nonreciprocity among a small set of active components enables sequence-level programmability from single-molecule dynamics to emergent collective behavior, providing a minimal mechanism to encode and control active-matter dynamics across scales.</p>

Chapman</p>
            <p>Molecular and polymeric crystals show a wide range of functional properties that arise from the interplay between the atomic-scale structure of their constituent molecules and the organization of these molecules within the crystal lattice at macroscopic length scales. X-ray diffraction can provide structural information at these disparate length scales, but usually only through experiments that address one or the other of molecular (or unit-cell) structure versus crystal structure. Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal. The approach may assist in studies such as diffusion and binding in MOFS, protein-drug binding, crystal growth, and the mechanical responses of photo-reactive or thermally driven dynamic crystals.</p>
