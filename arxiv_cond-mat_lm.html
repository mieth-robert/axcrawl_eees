            <h2>Physics-Informed Neural Operators for Generalizable and Label-Free Inference of Temperature-Dependent Thermoelectric Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeonbin Moon, Songho Lee, Wabi Demeke, Byungki Ryu, Seunghwa Ryu</p>
            <p>Accurate characterization of temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), such as thermal conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient, is essential for reliable modeling and efficient design of thermoelectric devices. However, their nonlinear temperature dependence and coupled transport behavior make both forward simulation and inverse identification difficult, particularly under sparse measurement conditions. In this study, we develop a physics-informed machine learning approach that employs physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for solving forward and inverse problems in thermoelectric systems, and neural operators (PINO) to enable generalization across diverse material systems. The PINN enables field reconstruction and material property inference by embedding governing transport equations into the loss function, while the PINO generalizes this inference capability across diverse materials without retraining. Trained on simulated data for 20 p-type materials and evaluated on 60 unseen materials, the PINO model demonstrates accurate and label-free inference of TEPs using only sparse field data. The proposed framework offers a scalable, generalizable, and data-efficient approach for thermoelectric property identification, paving the way for high-throughput screening and inverse design of advanced thermoelectric materials.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnet-Superconductor Heterostructure: a Scalable Platform for Braiding of Majorana Modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Themba Hodge, Eric Mascot, Stephan Rachel</p>
            <p>Topological quantum computation, featuring qubits built out of anyonic excitations known as Majorana zero modes (MZMs), have long presented an exciting pathway towards scalable quantum computation. Recently, the advent of altermagnetic materials has presented a new pathway towards localized MZMs on the boundary of two-dimensional materials, consisting of an altermagnetic film, subject to a superconducting proximity effect from a superconducting substrate. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility for an altermagnet-superconductor heterostructure, to not only harbor MZMs, but also freely manipulate their position along the topological boundary of the material, via rotation of the Néel vector. Using this mechanism, on a square platform, we utilize a time-dependent method to simulate the Z-gate via braiding, and then extend this to a larger H-junction, where we implement the $\sqrt{X}$ and $\sqrt{Z}$ gate on a single-qubit system. Further, this structure is eminently scalable to many-qubit systems, thus providing the essential ingredients towards universal quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Composite Superconducting Orders and Magnetism in CeRh$_2$As$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Jakubczyk, Julia M. Link, Carsten Timm</p>
            <p>Locally noncentrosymmetric materials are attracting significant attention due to the unique phenomena associated with sublattice degrees of freedom. The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has emerged as a compelling example of this class, garnering widespread interest for its remarkable temperature-magnetic-field phase diagram, which features a field-induced first-order superconductor-to-superconductor phase transition with nontrivial dependence on the field direction and high critical fields, as well as antiferromagnetic and potentially higher multipole orders. To investigate the complex interplay of the ordered phases in CeRh$_2$As$_2$, we develop a theoretical framework based on symmetry analysis combined with Bogoliubov--de Gennes and Landau methods. This approach allows us to propose probable symmetries of the superconducting states and elucidate their close relationship with magnetism. Intriguingly, we find that the first-order transition can be interpreted as a transition between coexistence phases of the same symmetry but with distinct admixtures of individual superconducting order parameters. This line may end in a critical endpoint below the superconducting critical temperature. Our approach accurately reproduces current experimental phase diagrams for varying temperature as well as out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic field, both if the transition to a magnetic phase occurs below the superconducting critical temperature and if it occurs above. Furthermore, we calculate the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat and compare these quantities to recent experimental results.</p>

            <h2>Visualizing a Terahertz Superfluid Plasmon in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor</h2>

            <p>The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, where the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional copper-oxygen planes, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at sub-gap millielectronvolt energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers. However, within the copper-oxygen planes the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply sub-diffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near-field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance-absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase-and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum- and frequency dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. These results establish a new platform for investigating superfluid phenomena at finite momenta and THz frequencies, highlighting the potential to engineer and visualize superconducting devices operating at ultrafast THz rates.</p>

            <h2>Spin-split superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled hybrid nanowires with ferromagnetic barriers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Zhao, A. Mazanik, D. Razmadze, Y. Liu, P. Krogstrup, F. S. Bergeret, S. Vaitiekėnas</p>
            <p>We report transport studies of hybrid Josephson junctions based on semiconducting InAs nanowires with fully overlapping epitaxial ferromagnetic insulator EuS and superconducting Al partial shells. Current-biased measurements reveal a hysteretic superconducting window with a sizable supercurrent near the coercive field of the ferromagnetic insulator, accompanied by multiple Andreev reflections. Tunneling spectroscopy shows a superconducting gap characterized by three peaks, which we attribute to tunneling between exchange-split superconductors. A theoretical model reproduces the observed features and indicates that spin mixing, driven by sizable spin-orbit coupling, is essential to their formation. Our results demonstrate proximity-induced superconductivity through a ferromagnetic insulator and establish a new platform for exploring spin-triplet pairing.</p>

            <h2>Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Si-Jing Du, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan</p>
            <p>We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.</p>

            <h2>Exciton condensation from level repulsion: application to bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harley D. Scammell, Oleg P. Sushkov</p>
            <p>Exciton condensation in semiconductors and semimetals has long been predicted but remains elusive. In a semiconductor, condensation occurs when the exciton binding energy matches the band gap. This binding energy results from a balance between Coulomb attraction, which enhances it, and kinetic energy, which suppresses it. However, reducing kinetic energy typically increases screening, weakening Coulomb attraction. Empirically, in most candidate materials, the binding energy remains below the band gap, with few external parameters capable of altering this balance. Here, we propose an in-plane electric field as a control parameter. This field induces hybridisation between even- and odd-parity excitons, and the resulting level repulsion effectively enhances binding energy. We argue that this mechanism is generic to excitons in semiconductors and illustrate it with a model of biased bilayer graphene. Bilayer graphene is chosen since it has a tunable band gap, making it an excitonic condensate candidate and moreover, the Zener tunnelling rate contains, in addition to the usual exponential decay, a non-standard oscillating component -- thanks to details of the electron dispersion. Analogous to quantum oscillations, we propose that Fourier spectrum of the current-voltage data allows for a novel test of exciton condensation. Finally, we show that the is a large excitonic gap to critical temperature ratio -- a clear prediction for STM studies.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihang Wang, Dirk Bouwmeester</p>
            <p>Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</p>

            <h2>Andreev spin qubit protected by Franck-Condon blockade</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. D. Kurilovich, T. Vakhtel, T. Connolly, C. G. L. Bøttcher, B. van Heck</p>
            <p>Andreev levels localized in a weak link between two superconductors can trap a superconducting quasiparticle. If there is a spin-orbit coupling in the link, the spin of the quasiparticle couples to the Josephson current. This effect can be leveraged to control and readout the spin of the quasiparticle thus using it as a qubit. One of the factors limiting the performance of such an Andreev spin qubit is spin relaxation. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that the relaxation lifetime can be enhanced by utilizing the coupling between the Andreev spin and the supercurrent in a transmon circuit. The coupling ensures that the flip of the quasiparticle spin can only happen if it is accompanied by the excitation of multiple plasmons, as dictated by the Frank-Condon principle. This blocks spin relaxation at temperatures small compared to plasmon energy.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi</p>
            <p>We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place after the system becomes superradiant at a finite pumping strength. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Exciton Delocalization Suppresses Polariton Scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongseok Hong, Ding Xu, Milan Delor</p>
            <p>Exciton-polaritons (EPs) are part-light part-matter quasiparticles that combine large exciton-mediated nonlinearities with long-range coherence, ideal for energy harvesting and nonlinear optics. Optimizing EPs for these applications is predicated on a still-elusive understanding of how disorder affects their propagation and dephasing times. Here, using cutting-edge femtosecond spatiotemporal microscopy, we directly image EP propagation at light-like speeds in systems ranging from two-dimensional semiconductors to amorphous molecular films with systematically varied exciton-phonon coupling, exciton delocalization, and static disorder. Despite possessing similar EP dispersions, we observe dramatically different transport velocities and scattering times across systems. We establish a robust scaling law linking EP scattering to exciton transfer integral, demonstrating that polaritons based on materials with large exciton bandwidths are immune to disorder even for highly excitonic EPs. This observation cannot be deduced from the systems' linear optical properties, including EP dispersion and linewidth disorder. Our work highlights the critical and often-overlooked role of the matter component in dictating polariton properties, and provides precise guidelines for simultaneously optimizing EP propagation and nonlinearities.</p>

            <h2>Unified model for non-Abelian braiding of Majorana and Dirac fermion zero modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Huang, Rui Zhang, Xiaopeng Li, Xiong-Jun Liu, X. C. Xie, Yijia Wu</p>
            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are the most intensively studied non-Abelian anyons. The Dirac fermion zero modes in topological insulators, which are symmetry-protected doubling of MZMs under fermion number conservation, offer an alternative approach to explore non-Abelian anyons. However, a unified model that elucidates the braiding statistics of these types of topological zero modes remains absent. We show that the minimal Kitaev chain model beyond fine-tuning regime provides a unified characterization of the non-Abelian statistics of both MZMs and Dirac fermion zero modes in different parameter regimes. In particular, we introduce a minimal tri-junction setting based on the minimal Kitaev chain model and show it facilitates the unified scheme of braiding Dirac fermion zero modes, as well as the MZMs in the assistance of a Dirac mode. This unified minimal model provides deeper insights into non-Abelian statistics, demonstrating that the non-Abelian braiding of MZMs can be continuously extended to encompass Dirac fermion zero modes. The minimal Kitaev chain has been realized in coupled quantum dots [Nature 614, 445 (2023)]. Our extension, which demonstrates novel nontrivial phases with non-Abelian MZM pairs and Dirac zero modes emerging in the broader parameter regimes without fine-tuning, expands the accessible experimental parameter space and enhances the feasibility of observing non-Abelian statistics in the minimal Kitaev chain model.</p>

            <h2>Edge states and persistent current in a PT-symmetric extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with generic boundary conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Supriyo Ghosh, Pijush K. Ghosh, Shreekantha Sil</p>
            <p>We consider a generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) model by including next-nearest neighbour(NNN) interaction and balanced loss-gain(BLG), and subjecting the whole system to an external uniform magnetic field. We study the band structure, edge states and persistent current in this extended SSH model under General Boundary Condition(GBC) of which the periodic, anti-periodic and open boundary conditions appear as special cases. It is shown that the point bandgap decreases with the increasing value of the strength of the NNN interaction and vanish beyond a critical value. Further, the line gap exhibits closed-loop like structures for non-vanishing NNN interaction under the Periodic Boundary Condition(PBC). The Zak phase receives no contribution from the NNN interaction under the PBC. We show that the NNN interaction has no effect on the persistent current in the half-filled limit for the case of PBC. We show that the model without the NNN interaction is exactly solvable for a class of GBC of which PBC, anti-periodic boundary condition(APBC) and anti-hermitian boundary condition(AHBC) arise as special cases. We obtain analytic expressions for the edge states in the case of Open Boundary Condition(OBC) and AHBC for vanishing NNN interaction. We show numerically for OBC that edge states in the topologically trivial phase appear for non-vanishing NNN interaction in the parametric regions where PT-symmetry is broken under PBC. In the topologically non-trivial phase, the edge states under OBC exists only up to a critical value of the NNN strength and vanishes beyond a critical value. The bulk-boundary correspondence(BBC) for unbroken PT-phase is similar to hermitian SSH model, while non-Hermitian skin effect(NHSE) is observed for broken PT-phase.</p>

            <h2>Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Chen, Yijia Wu, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p>We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.</p>

            <h2>Probing quantum geometry with two-dimensional nonlinear optical spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Froese, Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>Recent studies have shown that the nonlinear optical response of crystalline systems is fundamentally a quantum geometric property. In this work, we propose two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which measures the nonlinear conductivity as a function of two independent frequencies using two time-delayed light pulses, as a probe of quantum geometry. We show how the two-frequency second-order nonlinear conductivity, which is naturally measured by 2DCS, decomposes into distinct quantum geometric contributions. We identify a term arising from the multi-band quantum connection that does not appear in linear response, and show that it can be measured in isolation by considering specific polarizations and enforcing time-reversal symmetry. We explore this finding via model calculations for transition metal dichalcogenides and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Through these examples, we demonstrate how 2DCS enables study of the quantum connection, providing a way to compare the quantum geometry of different materials. We also show that one can gain rough momentum-resolved knowledge of the quantum geometry by varying the chemical potential.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polaritons - coherently hybridized states of excitons and photons - are instrumental for solid-state nonlinear optics and quantum simulations. To enable engineered polariton energy landscapes and interactions, local control over the particle-like states can be achieved by tuning the properties of the exciton constituent. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides stand out in this respect, as they readily allow for a deterministic, flexible and scalable control of excitons, and thus of hybrid exciton-polaritons, via environmental dielectric engineering. Here, we demonstrate the realization of mesoscopic exciton-polariton domains in a structured dielectric exciton environment, and establish an effective long-range exciton hopping in the dispersive regime of cavity-coupling. Our results represent a crucial step toward interacting polaritonic networks and quantum simulations in exciton-polariton lattices based on dielectrically tailored two-dimensional semiconductors.</p>

            <p>This review synthesizes recent advancements in the study of moiré magnetism. This emerging field, at the intersection of twistronics, topology, and strongly correlated systems, explores novel phenomena that arise when moiré potentials influence magnetic two-dimensional systems. The manuscript presents recent advances highlighting the interfacial incongruity as a novel mechanism for regulating the magnetism of two-dimensional materials and for the manifestation of various phenomena in twisted and mismatched magnetic two-dimensional interfaces. The manuscript addresses seminal and recent experimental and theoretical advances associated with both small- and large-period magnetic moiré lattices, including novel magnetic phases, low-energy and topological magnetic excitations, magnetic and electronic transport, optical properties, phase transitions, and prospective applications of these materials. Moiré magnetism signifies a promising frontier for manipulating complex quantum states in quantum matter. The ongoing advances in this field are poised to impact condensed matter physics, materials science, and quantum information science.</p>

            <p>Quasiparticle condensates are among the most spectacular solid-state manifestations of quantum physics. Coupling macroscopic real-space wave functions to other degrees of freedom, such as the electron spin, could add valuable control knobs for quantum applications. While creating spin-carrying superconducting condensates has attracted enormous attention, man-made condensates of light-matter hybrids known as exciton-polaritons have lacked a comparable spin-related perspective. Here we open a new door by demonstrating exciton-polariton condensation in the antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr, a van der Waals material with strongly intertwined optical and magnetic properties. Under photoexcitation, CrSBr microwires embedded in an optical cavity show the hallmarks of polariton condensation: a dramatic increase of the emission intensity from an excited laterally confined polariton state by multiple orders of magnitude, spectral narrowing of the emission line, and an intriguing continuous shift of the peak energy. Interferometry evidences an increase of spatial and temporal coherence. The conditions for efficient optical pumping suggest a crucial role of surface excitons and ultrafast polariton-magnon scattering. Our results highlight CrSBr microwires as a promising platform for exploring magnetically tunable polariton condensates, their directional propagation and their potential for spin-based quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters are a key component in photonic quantum technologies. Enhancing their single-photon emission by engineering the photonic environment using cavities can significantly improve the overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often constrained by the need for precise nanoscale control over the emitter's position within micro- or nano-cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moiré patterns, we present an approach to strongly modify the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter using a finely designed multilayer moiré photonic crystal with a robust isolated-flatband dispersion. Theoretical analysis reveals that, due to its nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moiré cavity can simultaneously achieve a high Purcell factor and exhibit large tolerance over the emitter's position. We experimentally demonstrate the coupling between this moiré cavity and a quantum dot through the cavity-determined polarization of the dot's emission. The radiative lifetime of the quantum dot can be tuned by a factor of 40, ranging from 42 ps to 1692 ps, which is attributed to strong Purcell enhancement and Purcell inhibition effects. Our findings pave the way for moiré flatband cavity-enhanced quantum light sources, quantum optical switches, and quantum nodes for quantum internet applications.</p>

            <h2>Exciton--hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridization in Biased Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomer Eini, N. M. R. Peres, Yarden Mazor, Itai Epstein</p>
            <p>Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</p>

            <h2>polyBART: A Chemical Linguist for Polymer Property Prediction and Generative Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anagha Savit, Harikrishna Sahu, Shivank Shukla, Wei Xiong, Rampi Ramprasad</p>
            <p>Designing polymers for targeted applications and accurately predicting their properties is a key challenge in materials science owing to the vast and complex polymer chemical space. While molecular language models have proven effective in solving analogous problems for molecular discovery, similar advancements for polymers are limited. To address this gap, we propose polyBART, a language model-driven polymer discovery capability that enables rapid and accurate exploration of the polymer design space. Central to our approach is Pseudo-polymer SELFIES (PSELFIES), a novel representation that allows for the transfer of molecular language models to the polymer space. polyBART is, to the best of our knowledge, the first language model capable of bidirectional translation between polymer structures and properties, achieving state-of-the-art results in property prediction and design of novel polymers for electrostatic energy storage. Further, polyBART is validated through a combination of both computational and laboratory experiments. We report what we believe is the first successful synthesis and validation of a polymer designed by a language model, predicted to exhibit high thermal degradation temperature and confirmed by our laboratory measurements. Our work presents a generalizable strategy for adapting molecular language models to the polymer space and introduces a polymer foundation model, advancing generative polymer design that may be adapted for a variety of applications.</p>

            <h2>Geometric Bloch oscillations and transverse displacement in flat band systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Xin Liu, Giandomenico Palumbo, Marco Di Liberto</p>
            <p>We investigate transport phenomena and dynamical effects in flat bands where the band dispersion plays no role. We show that wavepackets in geometrically non-trivial flat bands can display dynamics when inhomogeneous electric fields are present. This dynamics is revealed both for the wavepacket trajectory and for its variance, for which we derive semiclassical equations extended to the non-Abelian case. Our findings are tested in flat band models in one- and two-dimensional lattices where the dynamics is solely determined by geometric effects, in the absence of band dispersion. In particular, in the one-dimensional case, we show the existence of Bloch oscillations for the wavepacket position and for the wavepacket variance, whereas in the two-dimensional case we observe a transverse displacement of the wavepacket in the absence of Berry curvature. This work paves the way for understanding quantum-geometry-induced dynamical effects in flat band materials and also opens the possibility for their observation with synthetic matter platforms.</p>

            <h2>Emergent gravity and gravitational lensing in quantum materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yugo Onishi, Nisarga Paul, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>We show that an effective gravitational field naturally emerges in quantum materials with long-wavelength spin (or pseudospin) textures. When the itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation. The emergent gravity gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of the gravitational lensing. Our work shows that novel ``gravitational'' phenomena generically appear in quantum systems due to nonadiabaticity, opening new research directions in quantum physics.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic field-free braiding and nontrivial fusion of Majorana bound states in high-temperature planar Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pankaj Sharma, Narayan Mohanta</p>
            <p>Demonstration of non-Abelian statistics of zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) is crucial for long-sought-after decoherence-free topological quantum computing. The ability to move the MBS on a two-dimensional platform such as a planar Josephson junction is practically constrained by a fixed direction of applied magnetic field. In addition, the detrimental effects of the magnetic field on proximity-induced superconductivity in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures is an outstanding problem for the realization of topological superconductivity. Here we show that these problems can be solved in a planar Josephson junction coupled to a skyrmion crystal, which generates the MBS without the need of any external magnetic field, phase biasing, and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Using a high-temperature superconductor having $d$-wave pairing symmetry, we confirm that our planar junction can support the MBS at high temperatures. We propose protocols for performing non-trivial fusion, exchange and non-Abelian braiding of multiple MBS in our field-free platforms. The proposed geometries and MBS movement protocols open a path towards successful experimental detection of the MBS via confirmation of their non-Abelian statistics.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Ge, Xiaoqi Liu, Pinyuan Wang, Haowen Pang, Qiangwei Yin, Hechang Lei, Ziqiang Wang, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.</p>

            <p>Elucidating dielectric losses, structural heterogeneity, and interface imperfections is critical for improving coherence in superconducting qubits.

We further employ a THz hyperspectral line scan to probe dielectric responses and field participation at Al junction interfaces. These findings highlight the promise of THz near-field methods as a high-throughput proxy characterization tool for guiding material selection and optimizing processing protocols to improve qubit and quantum circuit performance.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast Orbital-Selective Photodoping Melts Charge Order in Overdoped Bi-based Cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyi Jiang, Qizhi Li, Qingzheng Qiu, Li Yue, Junhan Huang, Yiwen Chen, Byungjune Lee, Hyeongi Choi, Xingjiang Zhou, Tao Dong, Nanlin Wang, Hoyoung Jang, Yingying Peng</p>
            <p>High-temperature superconductivity in cuprates remains one of the enduring puzzles of condensed matter physics, with charge order (CO) playing a central yet elusive role, particularly in the overdoped regime. Here, we employ time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant X-ray scattering at a free-electron laser to probe the transient electronic density of states and ultrafast CO dynamics in overdoped (Bi,Pb)$_{2.12}$Sr$_{1.88}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$. We reveal a striking pump laser wavelength dependence - the 800 nm light fails to suppress CO, whereas the 400 nm light effectively melts it. This behavior originates from the fact that 400 nm photons can promote electrons from the Zhang-Rice singlet band to the upper Hubbard band or apical oxygen states, while 800 nm photons lack the energy to excite electrons across the charge-transfer gap. The CO recovery time ($\sim$3 ps) matches that of the underdoped cuprates, indicating universal electronic instability in the phase diagram. Additionally, melting overdoped CO requires an order-of-magnitude higher fluence highlighting the role of lattice interactions. Our findings demonstrate orbital-selective photodoping and provide a route to ultrafast control of emergent quantum phases in correlated materials.</p>

            <h2>Tunable spin-phonon polarons in a chiral molecular qubit framework</h2>

            <p>Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. However, direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that clearly indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zichen Lian, Yongqian Wang, Yongchao Wang, Liangcai Xu, Jinsong Zhang, Chang Liu, Yayu Wang</p>
            <p>The topological quantum phases in antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ hold promise for next-generation spintronics, but their experimental realization has been constrained by challenges in preparing high-quality devices. In this work, we report a new wax-assisted exfoliation and transfer method that enables the fabrication of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ heterostructures with both surfaces encapsulated by AlO$_x$. This strategy strongly enhances the topological quantum phases in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ flakes. We observe the robust axion insulator state in even-layer device with wide zero Hall plateau and high longitudinal resistivity, and the quantum anomalous Hall effect in odd-layer device with large hysteresis and sharp plateau transition. These results demonstrate that the combination of wax exfoliation and AlO$_x$ encapsulation provides great potentials for exploring novel topological quantum phenomena and potential applications in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and other two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <h2>Delicate Wannier insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zoltán Guba, Aris Alexandradinata, Tomáš Bzdušek</p>
            <p>The defining feature of topological insulators is that their valence states are not continuously deformable to a suitably defined atomic limit without breaking the symmetry or closing the energy gap. When the atomic limit is given by symmetric exponentially-localized Wannier orbitals, one finds stable and fragile topological insulators characterized by robust bulk-boundary correspondence. More recently, delicate topological insulators (DIs) have been introduced, whose metallic states are guaranteed only at sharply terminated edges and surfaces. Although Wannierizable, their Wannier orbitals necessarily span multiple unit cells, thus refining the notion of the atomic limit. In this work, we extend delicate topological invariants from Bloch states to hybrid Wannier functions. The resulting models, dubbed delicate Wannier insulators (DWIs), are deformable to unicellular atomic limit in the absence of edges and surfaces; nevertheless, they exhibit obstructions to such deformations as well as topological boundary states in the presence of sharply terminated hinges and corners. We present a layering construction that allows us to elevate a DI in $d$ dimensions into a DWI in $(d\,{+}\,1)$ dimensions. We illustrate the phenomenology of DWIs by deploying the layering construction on three concrete models.</p>

            <h2>Designer polyradical nanographenes with strong spin entanglement and perturbation resilience via Clar's goblet extension</h2>

            <p>Polyradical nanographenes featuring strong spin entanglement and robust many-body spin states against external magnetic perturbations not only enable the exploration of correlated quantum magnetism at the molecular scale, but also constitute promising candidates for developing molecular qubits with chemical tunability and building scalable quantum networks. Here, we employed a predictive design strategy to achieve the on-surface synthesis of two homologues of Clar goblet, C62H22 and C76H26, via lateral and vertical extensions of the parent structure, respectively. Vertical extension increases the number of topologically frustrated zero-energy modes, which scale linearly with the total number of benzene ring rows. In contrast, the lateral extension enhances electron-electron interactions, leading to the emergence of additional radical states beyond those predicted by the topological zero-energy modes. Consequently, both structures exhibit correlated tetraradical character and a many-body singlet ground state as confirmed by multireference theoretical calculations. These magnetic states arise from unique magnetic origins and also display distinct resilience to external perturbations, which can be experimentally validated using nickelocene-functionalized scanning probe techniques. Our work presents a general strategy for rational design of highly entangled polyradical nanographenes with tunable spin numbers and resilience of their many-body spin states to perturbations, opening exciting possibilities for exploring novel correlated spin phases in molecular systems and advancing quantum information technologies.</p>

            <h2>Overlap Gap and Computational Thresholds in the Square Wave Perceptron</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Benedetti, Andrej Bogdanov, Enrico M. Malatesta, Marc Mézard, Gianmarco Perrupato, Alon Rosen, Nikolaj I. Schwartzbach, Riccardo Zecchina</p>
            <p>Square Wave Perceptrons (SWPs) form a class of neural network models with oscillating activation function that exhibit intriguing ``hardness'' properties in the high-dimensional limit at a fixed signal-to-noise ratio $\alpha = O(1)$. In this work, we examine two key aspects of these models. The first is related to the so-called overlap-gap property, that is a disconnectivity feature of the geometry of the solution space of combinatorial optimization problems proven to cause the failure of a large family of solvers, and conjectured to be a symptom of algorithmic hardness. We identify, both in the storage and in the teacher-student settings, the emergence of an overlap gap at a threshold $\alpha_{\mathrm{OGP}}(\delta)$, which can be made arbitrarily small by suitably increasing the frequency of oscillations $1/\delta$ of the activation. This suggests that in this small-$\delta$ regime, typical instances of the problem are hard to solve even for small values of $\alpha$. Second, in the teacher-student setup, we show that the recovery threshold of the planted signal for message-passing algorithms can be made arbitrarily large by reducing $\delta$. These properties make SWPs both a challenging benchmark for algorithms and an interesting candidate for cryptographic applications.</p>

            <h2>The non-Hermitian magnetic moment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bar Alon, Moshe Goldstein, Roni Ilan</p>
            <p>We construct a semiclassical theory for electrons in a non-Hermitian periodic system subject to perturbations varying slowly in space and time. We derive the energy of the wavepacket to first order in the gradients of the perturbations. Applying the theory to the specific case of a uniform external magnetic field, we obtain an expression for the orbital magnetization energy. Using the principles of non-Hermitian dynamics, we define a physically meaningful non-Hermitian generalization of the angular momentum operator and show that it is compatible with the real part of the orbital magnetic moment. The imaginary part of the orbital magnetic moment is also discussed and shown to originate from an imaginary counterpart to the angular momentum that gives rise to a non-Hermitian generalization of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.</p>

            <p>Computing topological invariants in two-dimensional quasicrystals and super-moire matter is an exceptional open challenge, due to the absence of translational symmetry and the colossal number of sites inherent to these systems. Here, we establish a method to compute local topological invariants of exceptionally large systems using tensor networks, enabling the computation of invariants for Hamiltonians with hundreds of millions of sites, several orders of magnitude above the capabilities of conventional methodologies. Our approach leverages a tensor-network representation of the density matrix using a Chebyshev tensor network algorithm, enabling large-scale calculations of topological markers in quasicrystalline and moire systems. We demonstrate our methodology with two-dimensional quasicrystals featuring 8-fold and 10-fold rotational symmetries and mosaics of Chern phases. Our work establishes a powerful method to compute topological phases in exceptionally large-scale topological systems, establishing the required tool to rationalize generic super-moire and quasicrystalline topological matter.</p>

            <p>We study charge fluctuations of a family of stochastic charged cellular automata away from the deterministic single-file limit and obtain the exact typical charge probability distributions, known to be anomalous, using hydrodynamics. The cellular automata considered are examples of linearly degenerate systems where two distinct mechanisms of diffusion, namely normal and convective diffusion, coexist. Our formalism, based on macroscopic fluctuation theory, allows us to describe current fluctuations stemming from these two diffusive processes, and we expect it to be applicable to generic linearly degenerate systems.

            <p>We numerically investigate the shear rheology of mixtures of active and passive Brownian particles, with varying fractions of active components. We find that even a small fraction of active dopants triggers fluidization with comparable efficiency to fully active systems. A combined parameter, active energy, given by dopant fraction multiplied by propulsion speed squared controls the shear rheology and glass transition of the active-passive mixtures. These results together provide a quantitative strategy for fine-tuning the mechanical properties of a soft material with small amounts of active dopants.</p>

            <h2>Geometric and Nonequilibrium Criticality in Run-and-Tumble Particles with Competing Motility and Attraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abir Bhowmick, Sayantan Mitra, P. K. Mohanty</p>
            <p>Self-propulsion in run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) generates effective attractive interactions that can drive motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), a phenomenon absent in their passive counterparts. In this work, we show that at high motility, introducing explicit attractive interactions among RTPs can suppress MIPS, leading to a homogeneous phase, and subsequently induce a re-emergence of phase separation at stronger attraction --thus realizing a reentrant phase transition. We characterize this transition by examining the percolation properties of dense clusters, which serve as geometric signatures of phase separation. Along the resulting critical line, we observe continuously varying critical exponents, while some of the associated scaling functions remain invariant and coincide with those of equilibrium lattice gas models undergoing interacting percolation, which is Ising-percolation universality. These findings reveal that the phase separation transition in interacting RTPs exhibits Ising-like super universality, bridging nonequilibrium active matter with classical critical behavior.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear projection for ballistic correlation functions: a formula in terms of minimal connected covers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Doyon</p>
            <p>In many-body systems, the dynamics is governed, at large scales of space and time, by the hydrodynamic principle of projection onto the conserved densities admitted by the model. This is formalised as local relaxation of fluctuations in the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, a nonlinear Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. We use it to derive a projection formula, expressing n-point connected correlation functions (cumulants) of generic observables at different space-time points, in terms of those of conserved densities. This applies in every d >= 1 spatial dimensions and under the ballistic scaling of space and time, both in and out of equilibrium. It generalises the well-known linear-response principle for 2-point functions. For higher-point functions, one needs to account for nonlinear fluctuations of conserved densities. The result is a nonlinear projection, expressed as a sum over certain products of lower-order correlation functions of conserved densities with equilibrium multivariances as coefficients. Using Malyshev's formula, the sum is combinatorially organised via certain covers of the set of space-time points, which we call "minimal connected covers". We use this in order to get general, explicit formulas for two- and three-point functions in stationary states, expressed in terms of thermodynamic and Euler-scale data.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic noise in one dimension: projected Kubo formula and its vanishing in integrable models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Doyon</p>
            <p>Hydrodynamic noise is the Gaussian process that emerges at larges scales of space and time in many-body systems. It arises by the central limit theorem applied to local microcanonical averages, representing the degrees of freedom that have been forgotten when projecting coarse-grained observables onto conserved quantities. It comes with "bare" diffusion terms. In one dimension of space, nonlinearities of the hydrodynamic equation are relevant (from a renormalisation perspective), usually giving rise to hydrodynamic superdiffusion. But in linearly degenerate systems, where the relevant nonlinearity vanishes, the diffusive scaling stays intact. Nevertheless, anomalies remain. We show that in such systems, the noise covariance is determined in terms of a modification of the Kubo formula, where effects of ballistic long-range correlations have been subtracted. This is the projected Onsager matrix, in which so-called quadratic charges are projected out. We show that the Einstein relation holds, giving a projected bare diffusion, and that the remaining nonlinearities are tamed by a point-splitting regularisation. Putting these ingredients together, we obtain an exact and well-defined hydrodynamic fluctuation theory in the ballistic scaling of space-time, for the asymptotic expansion in the inverse variation scale, including the first subleading (diffusive-scale) corrections beyond large deviations. This is expressed as a stochastic PDE. We then obtain the anomalous hydrodynamic equation, which takes into account separately long-range correlations and bare diffusion. Using these result, in integrable systems, we show that hydrodynamic noise must be absent, as was conjectured recently.</p>

Here, we study a dense binary mixture of motile and proliferating particles with exclusively repulsive interactions, where homeostasis in the proliferating subpopulation is maintained by pressure-induced removal. Using computer simulations, we show that phase separation emerges naturally in this system at high density and weak enough self-propulsion. We show that condensation is caused by interactions between motile particles induced by the growing phase, and recapitulate this behavior in an effective model of only motile particles with attractive interactions. Our results establish a new type of phase transition and pave a way to reinterpret the physics of dense cellular populations, such as bacterial colonies or tumors, as systems of mixed active matter.</p>

            <h2>Transient dynamics of associative memory models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David G. Clark</p>
            <p>Associative memory models such as the Hopfield network and its dense generalizations with higher-order interactions exhibit a "blackout catastrophe"--a discontinuous transition where stable memory states abruptly vanish when the number of stored patterns exceeds a critical capacity. This transition is often interpreted as rendering networks unusable beyond capacity limits. We argue that this interpretation is largely an artifact of the equilibrium perspective. We derive dynamical mean-field equations using a bipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models, with the Hopfield model as a special case, and solve them using a numerical scheme. We show that patterns can be transiently retrieved with high accuracy above capacity despite the absence of stable attractors. This occurs because slow regions persist in the above-capacity energy landscape as shallow, unstable remnants of below-capacity stable basins. The same transient-retrieval effect occurs in below-capacity networks initialized outside basins of attraction. "Transient-recovery curves" provide a concise visual summary of these effects, revealing graceful, non-catastrophic changes in retrieval behavior above capacity and allowing us to compare the behavior across interaction orders. This dynamical perspective reveals rich energy landscape structure obscured by equilibrium analysis and suggests biological neural circuits may exploit transient dynamics for memory retrieval. Furthermore, our approach suggests ways of understanding computational properties of neural circuits without reference to fixed points, advances the technical repertoire of numerical mean-field solution methods for recurrent neural networks, and yields new theoretical results on generalizations of the Hopfield model.</p>

Our results show that, besides affecting the mean squared displacement, the time-dependent diffusion coefficient, and the shear moduli, the micro-heterogeneities lead to displacement distributions that deviate from the usual Gaussian behavior. In addition, our study provides an analytical way to characterize the micro-heterogeneities of semisolid viscoelastic materials through their microrheology.</p>

            <h2>Landau-Ginzburg Paradigm of Topological Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan</p>
            <p>Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.</p>

            <h2>A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling-Yan Hung, Kaixin Ji, Ce Shen, Yidun Wan, Yu Zhao</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</p>

            <h2>Spinless and spinful charge excitations in moiré Fractional Chern Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Gonçalves, Juan Felipe Mendez-Valderrama, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Jiabin Yu, Xiaodong Xu, Di Xiao, B. Andrei Bernevig, Nicolas Regnault</p>
            <p>Fractionally charged elementary excitations, the quasi-electron and quasi-hole, are one of the hallmarks of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI). In this work, we observe that spontaneous spin polarization in twisted MoTe$_2$ leads to multiple species of low-energy quasi-particles distinguished by their spin quantum numbers. We perform large-scale exact diagonalization (ED) calculations to investigate the nature of these excitations and develop a method to extract their fundamental energetic properties. Focusing on $\theta = 3.7^{\circ}$ and filling factor $\nu = -2/3$ relevant to recent experiments, we show that spin-preserving (spinless) charge excitations have smaller gap than spin-flipping (spinful) excitations both with and without band mixing. This result is in qualitative agreement with the measured magnetic field dependence of the transport gaps. Beyond the spinless and spinful quasi-particle gaps, we extract the full quasi-electron and quasi-hole ``band structure'' and find significant dispersion with emergent magnetic translation symmetry -- a fundamental departure from the immobile excitations of the quantum Hall fluid. Our results establish a framework for computing the properties of novel elementary excitations in FCIs.</p>

            <h2>On the Potential of Microtubules for Scalable Quantum Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nick E. Mavromatos, Andreas Mershin, Dimitri V. Nanopoulos</p>
            <p>We examine the quantum coherence properties of tubulin heterodimers in the Microtubule (MT) lattice. In the cavity-MT model proposed by the authors, according to which the MT interiors are modeled as high-Q quantum-electrodynamics cavities, decoherence-resistant entangled states have been argued to emerge under physiological conditions, with decoherence times of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ s. The latter is the result of strong electric-dipole interactions of tubulin dimers with ordered-water dipole quanta in the MT interior. We re-interpret the classical nonlinear (pseudospin) $\sigma$-models, describing the emergent dynamics of solitonic excitations in such systems, as representing quantum coherent (or possibly pointer) states, arising from the incomplete collapse of quantum-coherent dipole states. These solitons mediate dissipation-free energy transfer across the MT networks. We underpin logic-gate-like behavior through MT-associated proteins and detail how these structures may support scalable, ambient-temperature quantum computation, with the fundamental unit of information storage being a quDit associated with the basic unit of the MT honeycomb lattice. We describe in detail the decision-making process, after the action of an external stimulus, during which optimal path selection for energy-loss-free signal and information transport across the MT network emerges. Finally, we propose experimental pathways, including Rabi-splitting spectroscopy and entangled surface plasmon probes, to experimentally validate our predictions for MT-based, scalable quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement suppression and quantum scars in a three-oscillator gravitational analogue</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. George Christopher, S. Shankaranarayanan (IIT Bombay)</p>
            <p>We study quantum correlations in a tripartite system of coupled harmonic oscillators, modeling mediator-induced interactions akin to those in quantum gravity proposals. Surprisingly, despite the system's integrability, we identify regimes where bipartite entanglement between distant oscillators vanishes even with non-zero quantum couplings. In the Heavy Mediator Regime, entanglement is restricted to sharply localized islands in parameter space, surrounded by extended regions of suppression, analogous to quantum scars in non-integrable systems. Fidelity analysis reveal that these low-entanglement states exhibit dynamical stability and spectral signatures reminiscent of quantum scars in non-integrable systems, suggesting a continuous-variable analogue of scarring tied to hidden phase-space symmetries. The Light Mediator Regime, by contrast, displays smooth entanglement generation. These results challenge entanglement-based tests of quantum gravity: the absence of entanglement need not imply classical mediation but may instead reflect a mediator dynamically constrained to a quantum subspace-akin to gravitational memory or decoherence-free subspaces. Our findings emphasize the necessity of probing the mediator's dynamical regime to unambiguously diagnose quantum gravity.</p>

            <p>A positron is equivalent to an electron traveling backward through time. Casting transmon superconducting qubits as akin to electrons, we simulate a positron with a transmon subject to particular resonant and off-resonant drives. We call positron-like transmons "antiqubits." An antiqubit's effective gyromagnetic ratio equals the negative of a qubit's. This fact enables us to time-invert a unitary implemented on a transmon by its environment. We apply this platform-specific unitary inversion, with qubit--antiqubit entanglement, to achieve a quantum advantage in phase estimation: consider measuring the strength of a field that points in an unknown direction. An entangled qubit--antiqubit sensor offers the greatest possible sensitivity (amount of Fisher information), per qubit, per application of the field. We prove this result theoretically and observe it experimentally. This work shows how antimatter, whether real or simulated, can enable platform-specific unitary inversion and benefit quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We report spectroscopic and time-resolved experimental observations to characterize the $[{\rm Xe}]4f^{13}(^2F^{o}_{5/2}){5d6s(}{^1\!D}){^{1}[5/2]^{o}_{5/2}}$ state in $^{172}$Yb$^+$ ions. We access this state from the metastable $4f^{14}5d (^2D_{3/2,5/2})$ manifold and observe an unexpectedly long lifetime of $\tau=37.9(9) \,\mu$s that allows visible Rabi oscillations and resolved-sideband spectroscopy. Using a combination of coherent population dynamics, high-fidelity detection and heralded state preparation, and optical pumping methods, we measure the branching ratios to the $^{2}D_{3/2}$, $^2D_{5/2}$, $^2S_{1/2}$ states to be 0.359(2), 0.639(2), 0.0023(16), respectively. The branching ratio to the $4f^{13}6s^{2}({^2F}_{7/2})$ is compatible with zero within our experimental resolution. We also report measurements of its Landé g-factor and the branching ratio of the ${^{2}{D}_{5/2}}$ to ${^{2}{S}_{1/2}}$ decay in $^{172}$Yb$^+$ to be 0.188(3), improving its relative uncertainty by an order of magnitude. Our measurements pave the way to a better understanding of the atomic structure of Yb$^+$ ions, which still lacks accurate numerical descriptions, and the use of high-lying excited states for partial detection and qubit manipulation in the omg architecture.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Detection of Dissipative Quantum Chaos</h2>

            <p>More than four decades of research on chaos in isolated quantum systems have led to the identification of universal signatures -- such as level repulsion and eigenstate thermalization -- that serve as cornerstones in our understanding of complex quantum dynamics. The emerging field of dissipative quantum chaos explores how these properties manifest in open quantum systems, where interactions with the environment play an essential role. We report the first experimental detection of dissipative quantum chaos and integrability by measuring the complex spacing ratios (CSRs) of open many-body quantum systems implemented on a high-fidelity superconducting quantum processor. Employing gradient-based tomography, we retrieve a ``donut-shaped'' CSR distribution for chaotic dissipative circuits, a hallmark of level repulsion in open quantum systems. For an integrable circuit, spectral correlations vanish, evidenced by a sharp peak at the origin in the CSR distribution. As we increase the depth of the integrable dissipative circuit, the CSR distribution undergoes an integrability-to-chaos crossover, demonstrating that intrinsic noise in the quantum processor is a dissipative chaotic process. Our results reveal the universal spectral features of dissipative many-body systems and establish present-day quantum computation platforms, which are predominantly used to run unitary simulations, as testbeds to explore dissipative many-body phenomena.</p>

            <p>We explore the spectral properties of the $4$-fermion Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with interaction sourced from a Lévy Stable (fat-tailed) distribution. Lévy random matrices are known to demonstrate non-ergodic behaviour through the emergence of a mobility edge. We study the eigenvalue distribution, focusing on long- and short-range correlations and extreme statistics. This model demonstrates a crossover from chaotic to integrable behaviour (in the spectral correlations) as the distribution becomes increasingly fat-tailed. We investigate this crossover through a hierarchical analysis of the eigenvalue spectrum, based on the multi-fractal hierarchy of the Lévy Stable distribution. The crossover is explained in terms of a genuine many-body effect, distinct from the transition (controlled by a mobility edge) in the Lévy random matrices. We conclude with comments on the model's solvability and discussion of possible models with exact transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Jansen, Samiah Hassan, Ruoyao Wang</p>
            <p>Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses. While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task (chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making near-term progress.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the general failure of the famous concept of tight binding and mode hybridization underlying modern theories of coupled open resonators. In spite of sophisticated examples in the literature, successfully illustrating these theories, the latter fail to describe any planar systems. This includes the simplest possible case of two dielectric slabs placed next to each other or separated by a distance, which is straightforward for verification, due to its analytical solvability. We present a rigorous theory capable of calculating correctly the eigenmodes of arbitrary three-dimensional dispersive coupled resonators in terms of their individual modes, providing insight into the proper mode hybridization and formation of bonding and antibonding supermodes. Planar optical resonators, such as coupled slabs and Bragg-mirror microcavities, are used for illustrative purposes as they allow precise and reliable verification of the theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanmoy Das, Daniel Lester, Anthony Stickland, Nicky Eshtiaghi</p>
            <p>Sedimentation of particulate suspensions in horizontal pipes can lead to formation, growth and consolidation of a solid-like bed which can severely retard pipeline performance. As stagnant flow conditions frequently arise during industrial processes, critical operational questions are: (i) at what rate and extent does sedimentation proceed, and (ii) can the sedimentation dynamics be predicted from conventional suspension characterisation methods? We address these questions by characterising the sedimentation properties of an aqueous Kaolin suspension via batch settling tests and comparing predictions from 1D sedimentation theory with experiments in a horizontally oriented cylindrical pipe. We show that particulate sedimentation can be accurately predicted, indicating that the estimated sedimentation properties are representative material properties, and that transient effects such as gravity currents are not significant. Conversely, we find that the consolidation of the sediment is not well predicted by 1D theory, suggesting that the stress state is not 1D and likely involves contributions from the pipe walls. These stagnant cylindrical pipe results provide a basis for the development of methods to predict pipeline sedimentation under more general (laminar and turbulent) flow conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Sorkin, Ned S. Wingreen</p>
            <p>Phase separation of biomolecular condensates is ubiquitous in living cells, promoting colocalization of enzymes and their substrates as well as achieving membrane-free compartmentalization. Energy-consuming processes are routinely used to regulate biocondensate growth by opposing the thermodynamic tendency toward coarsening. At the same time, cells often use energy to instead accelerate thermodynamic processes. Here, we theoretically explore the possibility of utilizing chemical reactions to accelerate biocondensate coarsening. We combine Lifshitz-Slyozov theory with a reaction-diffusion approach, wherein particles interconvert between phase-separating and inert forms. We find that mass conservation restricts the volume growth to be linear in time (as in the passive case) despite activity, though if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. Our acceleration theory is quantitatively supported by recent experiments on ripening in the presence of fueled interconversion reactions, under precisely the predicted conditions. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts as a regulator of metabolic channeling.</p>

            <p>Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial features of asymptotic freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates for the emergence of free probability behavior. Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</p>

            <p>We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant energy efficiency gains in AI training.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhayan Sahu, Yahui Li, Pablo Sala</p>
            <p>Strong symmetries enforce non-trivial quantum entanglement patterns on the stationary states of symmetric open quantum dynamics. Specifically, non-commuting conserved quantities lead to long-range quantum entanglement even for infinite temperature mixed states within fixed symmetry sectors. Leveraging the commutant algebra framework, we show that various bipartite entanglement measures for mixed states -- including exact and asymptotically-exact entanglement costs and squashed entanglement, which are generally intractable for a generic many-body mixed state -- can be computed for this class of states. In particular, we focus on strongly symmetric maximally mixed states arising from the Temperley-Lieb model, which features quantum Hilbert space fragmentation with exponentially large (in system size) non-Abelian commutants. We find that while both the logarithmic negativity and the `exact' entanglement cost for equal-size bipartitions scale with the volume of the system, the entanglement of formation, squashed entanglement, entanglement cost, and distillable entanglement exhibit subextensive scaling. We relate this separation in entanglement measures to a parametric difference between the entanglement cost of exact and asymptotically-exact state preparations, and infer this to be a consequence of a particular pattern of quantum Hilbert space fragmentation.</p>

            <p>The construction industry is a major consumer of raw materials, accounting for nearly half of global material usage annually, while generating significant waste that poses sustainability challenges. This paper explores the untapped potential of recycled plastics as a primary construction material, leveraging their lightweight, flexible, and customizable properties for advanced applications in modular chainmail systems. Through a computational workflow, the study optimizes the design, testing, and fabrication of vacuum-sealed chainmail structures composed of recycled plastic filaments, demonstrating their adaptability and structural performance for architectural use. Key contributions include a novel methodology for integrating recycled plastic filaments into chainmail geometries, validated through 2D sectional testing, 3D shell structure generation, and physical modeling under vacuum constraints. The research identifies the rectangular chainmail configuration as the most efficient and adaptable, achieving superior deformation capacity, material efficiency, and load-bearing performance. Optimization strategies for temporary structures highlight practical deployment potential, balancing material savings, usable area, and water drainage efficiency. The findings offer a foundation for innovative applications in extreme conditions, including disaster-prone areas, high-altitude environments, underwater platforms, and extraterrestrial habitats. These applications leverage the lightweight, adaptable, and durable properties of recycled plastics and modular chainmail systems, bridging the gap between waste management and high-performance design while addressing unique challenges in harsh and resource-constrained environments.</p>

            <h2>Axion-mediated photon-to-photon transitions in high finesse dielectric resonators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evangelos Almpanis</p>
            <p>Axions are hypothetical particles that could address both the strong charge-parity problem in quantum chromodynamics and the enigmatic nature of dark matter. However, if axions exist, their mass remains unknown, and they are expected to interact very weakly with the electromagnetic field, which explains why they have not been detected yet. This study proposes a way to substantially augment the axion-photon interaction by confining the photons within high-quality-factor dielectric resonators, increasing their intensity and lifetime and thus the possibility of interacting with axions in the background. In view of this, we study resonant axion-mediated photonic transitions in millimeter-sized spherical dielectric resonators, based on fully analytical calculations to the first order in perturbation theory. Such resonators exhibit high lifetime Mie resonances in the microwave part of the spectrum, with a separation that can be tailored with the radius of the sphere to match the expected axion frequency, allowing axion-mediated photonic transitions when particular selection rules are fulfilled. Such transitions are expected to be enhanced by more than ten orders of magnitude in the presence of the resonator, compared to transitions occurring in homogeneous space.</p>

            <p>We study single cell this http URL chemotaxis in a spatio-temporally varying attractant environment. Modeling the attractant concentration in the form of a traveling sine wave, we measure in our simulations, the chemotactic drift velocity of the cell for different propagation speed of the attractant wave. We find a highly non-trivial dependence where the chemotactic drift velocity changes sign, and also shows multiple peaks. For slowly moving attractant wave, drift velocity is negative, i.e. the drift motion is directed opposite to wave propagation. As the wave speed increases, drift velocity shows a negative peak, then changes sign, reaches a positive peak and finally becomes zero when the wave moves too fast for the cell to respond. We explain this rich behavior from the difference in attractant gradient perceived by the cell during its run along the propagation direction and opposite to it. In particular, when the cell moves in the same direction as the wave, the relative velocity of the cell with respect to the wave becomes zero when the wave speed matches the run speed. In this limit, the cell is able to ride the wave and experiences no concentration gradient during these runs. On the contrary, for runs in the opposite direction, no such effect is present and the effective gradient increases monotonically with the wave speed. We show, using detailed quantitative measurements, how this difference gives rise to the counter-intuitive behavior of chemotactic drift velocity described above.</p>

            <p>Spatial mapping of thermal properties is critical for unveiling the structure-property relation of materials, heterogeneous interfaces, and devices. These property images can also serve as datasets for training artificial intelligence models for material discoveries and optimization. Here we introduce a high-throughput thermal property imaging method called compressive sensing frequency domain thermoreflectance (CS-FDTR), which can robustly profile thermal property distributions with micrometer resolutions while requiring only a random subset of pixels being experimentally measured. The high-resolution thermal property image is reconstructed from the raw down-sampled data through L_1-regularized minimization. The high-throughput imaging capability of CS-FDTR is validated using the following cases: (a) the thermal conductance of a patterned heterogeneous interface, (b) thermal conductivity variations of an annealed pyrolytic graphite sample, and (c) the sharp change in thermal conductivity across a vertical aluminum/graphite interface. With less than half of the pixels being experimentally sampled, the thermal property images measured using CS-FDTR show nice agreements with the ground truth (point-by-point scanning), with a relative deviation below 15%. This work opens the possibility of high-throughput thermal property imaging without sacrificing the data quality, which is critical for materials discovery and screening.</p>

            <p>Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</p>

            <p>Many-body localization is a profound phase of matter affecting the entire spectrum which emerges in the presence of disorder in interacting many-body systems. Recently, the stability of many-body localization has been challenged by the avalanche mechanism, in which a small thermal region can spread, destabilizing localization and leading to global thermalization of the system. A key unresolved question is the critical competition between the thermal region's influence and the disorder strength required to trigger such an avalanche. Here, we numerically investigate many-body localization stability in an isolated Heisenberg spin chain of size $L$ subjected to a disordered magnetic field. By embedding a tunable thermal region of size $P$, we analyze the system's behavior in both static and dynamical regimes using entanglement entropy and the gap ratio. Our study yields two main findings. Firstly, for strong disorder, the avalanche only occurs if the thermal region scales with system size, specifically when $P/L$ exceeds a threshold value. Secondly, at strong disorder, we identify an intermediate phase between many-body localization and ergodic behavior as $P$ increases. This intermediate phase leaves its finger print in both static and dynamic properties of the system and tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Although our simulations are restricted to finite system sizes, the analysis suggests that these results hold in the thermodynamic limit for isolated many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Thermoplasmonics of Gold-Core Silica-Shell Colloidal Nanoparticles under Pulse Illumination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julien El Hajj, Gilles Ledoux, Samy Merabia</p>
            <p>Core-shell nanoparticles, particularly those having a gold core, have emerged as a highly promising class of materials due to their unique optical and thermal properties, which underpin a wide range of applications in photothermal therapy, imaging, and biosensing. In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the thermal dynamics of gold-core silica-shell nanoparticles immersed in water under pulse illumination. The plasmonic response of the core-shell nanoparticle is described by incorporating Mie theory with electronic temperature corrections to the refractive indices of gold, based on a Drude Lorentz formulation. The thermal response of the core-shell nanoparticles is modeled by coupling the two temperature model with molecular dynamics simulations, providing an atomistic description of nanoscale heat transfer. We investigate nanoparticles with both dense and porous silica shells (with 50% porosity) under laser pulse durations of 100 fs, 10 ps, and 1 ns, and over a range of fluences between 0.05 and 5mJ/cm2. We show that nanoparticles with a thin dense silica shell (5 nm) exhibit significantly faster water heating compared to bare gold nanoparticles. This behavior is attributed to enhanced electron-phonon coupling at the gold silica interface and to the relatively high thermal conductance between silica and water. These findings provide new insights into optimizing nanoparticle design for efficient photothermal applications and establish a robust framework for understanding energy transfer mechanisms in heterogeneous metal dielectric nanostructures.</p>

            <h2>Organic Crystal Active Waveguide as an All-Angle Signal Receiver and Transmission Platform for Visible Light Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankur Khapre, Jyotisman Hazarika, Rajadurai Chandrasekar</p>
            <p>Organic crystal waveguides, known for excellent light-guiding and photonic versatility, present a promising alternative to conventional optical media in visible light communication (VLC) systems. In a novel approach, the high photoluminescence quantum yield organic crystal 2,2dash-((1E,1Edash)-hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(methaneylylidene))diphenol (SAA) is used as an optical waveguide medium for real-time data communication in the visible range, employing a microcontroller unit with on off keying modulation. Leveraging its spectral properties, the SAA crystal demonstrates dual active and passive waveguiding capabilities for signal modulation. Error-free signal detection is achieved thanks to the smooth, defect-free surface morphology of the crystal. The relationship between incident angle and light intensity reveals stable fluorescence under narrow angle excitation, positioning the crystal as an all-angle signal receiver that surpasses conventional optical fibers. A real time data transfer setup is demonstrated, enabling direct transmission from a serial interface and accurate reconstruction of grayscale images. This represents the first implementation of a fully organic crystal-based VLC platform, integrating wavelength conversion, omnidirectional waveguiding, and real time signal processing. The results establish a foundation for compact, efficient, and integrable photonic communication technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: Strengths of IQPE and noise constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Mirzakhani, Kyungsun Moon</p>
            <p>Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum simulation for strongly correlated electron systems. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To examine these limitations, we utilize the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real backend. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap between ideal and practical implementations. Overall, our results highlight the promise of quantum computing for simulating correlated quantum materials, while also revealing the significant challenges posed by hardware noise in achieving accurate and reliable physical predictions using current quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>A Gaussian process approach for rapid evaluation of skin tension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matt Nagle, Hannah Conroy Broderick, Christelle Vedel, Michel Destrade, Michael Fop, Aisling Ni Annaidh</p>
            <p>Skin tension plays a pivotal role in clinical settings, it affects scarring, wound healing and skin necrosis. Despite its importance, there is no widely accepted method for assessing in vivo skin tension or its natural pre-stretch. This study aims to utilise modern machine learning (ML) methods to develop a model that uses non-invasive measurements of surface wave speed to predict clinically useful skin properties such as stress and natural pre-stretch. A large dataset consisting of simulated wave propagation experiments was created using a simplified two-dimensional finite element (FE) model. Using this dataset, a sensitivity analysis was performed, highlighting the effect of the material parameters and material model on the Rayleigh and supersonic shear wave speeds. Then, a Gaussian process regression model was trained to solve the ill-posed inverse problem of predicting stress and pre-stretch of skin using measurements of surface wave speed. This model had good predictive performance (R2 = 0.9570) and it was possible to interpolate simplified parametric equations to calculate the stress and pre-stretch. To demonstrate that wave speed measurements could be obtained cheaply and easily, a simple experiment was devised to obtain wave speed measurements from synthetic skin at different values of pre-stretch. These experimental wave speeds agree well with the FE simulations and a model trained solely on the FE data provided accurate predictions of synthetic skin stiffness. Both the simulated and experimental results provide further evidence that elastic wave measurements coupled with ML models are a viable non-invasive method to determine in vivo skin tension.</p>

After validating our theoretical model against experimental data, we use the predictive power of our code to guide our experiment and, in particular, we explore the performance of different transitions of erbium for light-assisted collisions in terms of their efficiency and fidelity for single-atom preparation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Drougkakis, Georgios Vasilakis, Wolf von Klitzing</p>
            <p>Over the last two decades the cold-atom physics has matured from proof-of-principle demonstrations to a versatile platform for precision measurements and study of quantum phenomena. Ultra-cold atomic ensembles have been used both for technological and fundamental science applications. To fully exploit their potential, a precise measurement and control of the atom number in the ensemble is crucial. We report on a precise, minimally-destructive measurement technique that can be used to prepare an atomic ensemble with a desired atom number. The measurement relies on the dispersive light-atom interaction, thus it is expected to have a negligible effect on the ensemble temperature and to induce minimal decoherence in the atomic quantum state. As a result, it can be used to perform quantum-enhanced measurements and prepare the atom-number state at the start of an interferometer sequence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Hess, Quaid Morris</p>
            <p>Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one- and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks (equivalently, the attention mechanism).</p>

            <h2>How to Train Your Dragon: Quantum Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Zhang, Alex Kamenev</p>
            <p>Training of neural networks (NNs) has emerged as a major consumer of both computational and energy resources. We demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape--akin to cutting off the ever-regenerating heads of a dragon. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states (dragon heads to be cut). We found that this quantum-assisted training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a notably higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.</p>

            <p>Repeated quantum non-demolition measurement is a cornerstone of quantum error correction protocols. In superconducting qubits, the speed of dispersive state readout can be enhanced by increasing the power of the readout tone. However, such an increase has been found to result in additional qubit state transitions that violate the desired quantum non-demolition character of the measurement. Recently, the readout of a transmon superconducting qubit was improved by using a tone with frequency much larger than the qubit frequency. Here, we experimentally identify the mechanisms of readout-induced transitions in this regime. In the dominant mechanism, the energy of an incoming readout photon is partially absorbed by the transmon and partially returned to the transmission line as a photon with lower frequency. Other mechanisms involve the excitation of unwanted package modes, decay via material defects, and, at higher qubit frequencies, the activation of undesired resonances in the transmon spectrum. Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of superconducting qubit state transitions caused by a strong drive.</p>

Our delay update scheme can be implemented in both zero-temperature and finite-temperature versions of DQMC. We apply the delay update scheme to various strongly correlated electron models and evaluate its efficiency under different conditions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed delay update scheme significantly improves the efficiency of DQMC simulations, enable it to simulate larger system size.</p>

            <h2>Giant piezoelectricity driven by Thouless pump in conjugated polymers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Paolo Villani, Marco Campetella, Paolo Barone, Francesco Mauri</p>
            <p>Piezoelectricity of organic polymers has attracted increasing interest because of several advantages they exhibit over traditional inorganic ceramics. While most organic piezoelectrics rely on the presence of intrinsic local dipoles, a highly nonlocal electronic polarization can be foreseen in conjugated polymers, characterised by delocalized and highly responsive ${\pi}$-electrons. These 1D systems represent a physical realization of a Thouless pump, a mechanism of adiabatic charge transport of topological nature which results, as shown in this work, in anomalously large dynamical effective charges, inversely proportional to the band gap energy. A structural (ferroelectric) phase transition further contributes to an enhancement of the piezoelectric response reminiscent of that observed in piezoelectric perovskites close to morphotropic phase boundaries. First-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations performed in two representative conjugated polymers using hybrid functionals, show that state-of-the-art organic piezoelectric are outperformed by piezoelectric conjugated polymers, mostly thanks to strongly anomalous effective charges of carbon, larger than 5e - ordinary values being of the order of 1e - and reaching the giant value of 30e for band gaps of the order of 1 eV.</p>

            <p>We develop a method to calculate generic time-dependent correlation functions for inhomogeneous quantum quenches in (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) induced by sudden Hamiltonian deformations that modulate the energy density inhomogeneously. Our work particularly focuses on the effects of spatial boundaries, which have remained unresolved by previous analytical methods. For generic post-quench Hamiltonian, we develop a generic method to calculate the correlations by mirroring the system, which otherwise are Euclidean path integrals in complicated spacetime geometries difficult to calculate. On the other hand, for a special class of inhomogeneous post-quench Hamiltonians, including the Möbius and sine-square-deformation Hamiltonians, we show that the quantum quenches exhibit simple boundary effects calculable from Euclidean path integrals in a straightforward strip spacetime geometry. Applying our method to the time evolution of entanglement entropy, we find that for generic cases, the entanglement entropy shows discontinuities (shockwave fronts) propagating from the this http URL contrast, such discontinuities are absent in cases with simple boundary effects. We verify that our generic CFT formula matches well with numerical calculations from free fermion tight-binding models for various quench scenarios.</p>

With increasing the electric-field strength, the discretized spectra, the period of which is proportional to the strength, become dominant, and the density of states exhibits the Wannier-Stark ladder in their spectra. In addition, we also simulate time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy using an ultrashort terahertz pump pulse that approximates a dc electric field.

            <p>Recent observations of the fractional anomalous quantum Hall effect in moiré materials have reignited the interest in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). The chiral limit in which analytic Landau level-like single-particle states form an ``ideal" Chern band and local interactions lead to Laughlin-like FCIs at $1/3$ filling, has been very useful for understanding these systems by relating them to the lowest Landau level. We show, however, that, even in the idealized chiral limit, a fluctuating quantum geometry is associated with strongly broken symmetries and a phenomenology very different from that of Landau levels. In particular, particle-hole symmetry is strongly violated and e.g. at $2/3$ filling an emergent interaction driven Fermi liquid state with no Landau level counterpart is energetically favoured. In fact, even the exact Laughlin-like zero modes at $1/3$ filling have a non-uniform density tracking the underlying quantum geometry. Switching to a Coulomb interaction, the ideal Chern band with electron filling of $1/4$ features trivial charge density wave states. Moreover, applying a particle-hole transformation reveals that the ideal Chern band with hole filling of $3/4$ supports a quantum anomalous Hall crystal with quantized Hall conductance of $e^2/h$. These phenomena have no direct lowest Landau level counterpart.</p>

            <p>Heavy fermion UTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity that also exhibits multiple high-field superconducting phases. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.</p>

            <p>Real-time arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) is essential in various engineering and research applications. This paper introduces a novel AWG architecture using an NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) and a commercially available high-speed digital-to-analog converter (DAC) card, both running on a desktop personal computer (PC). The GPU accelerates the "embarrassingly" data-parallel additive synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG software is developed using the developer-friendly compute unified device architecture (CUDA) runtime application programming interface (API) from NVIDIA. With this architecture, we achieve a 586-fold increase in the speed of computing periodic radio-frequency (rf) arbitrary waveforms compared to a central processing unit (CPU). We also demonstrate two different pathways for dynamically controlling multi-tone rf waveforms, which we characterize by chirping individual single-frequency tones in the multi-tone waveforms. One pathway offers arbitrary simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at a sampling rate of 280 megasamples per second (MS/s) for a limited time duration of 35 ms. The other pathway offers simultaneous chirping of 340 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 50 MS/s, or 55 individual tones at 280 MS/s for an arbitrary duration. Using the latter pathway, we demonstrate control over 5000-tone and 10,000-tone waveforms by chirping all of their constituent tones in groups of up to 100 tones. This AWG architecture is designed for creating large defect-free optical tweezer arrays of single neutral atoms or molecules for quantum simulation and quantum computation.</p>

In this work we argue that the quantum dot used in the capacitance measurement can be reasonably approximated by a non-interacting weakly coupled orbital. We then predict the measured flux and parity dependent capacitance for several parameter regimes of the disordered Majorana nanowire model that are both topological and trivial. Following this we study how such a fast capacitance read-out can be used to characterize the quantum coherence of a Majorana nanowire-based qubit using Rabi oscillations. We additionally show that such measurements, if made possible by coherent inter-wire tunneling, would provide a valuable way of characterizing the low energy states in the frequency domain.</p>

            <p>Pair density wave (PDW) is an intriguing quantum matter proposed in the frontier of condensed matter physics. However, the existence of PDW in microscopic models has been rare. In this work, we obtain, by Ginzburg-Landau arguments and self-consistent mean field theory, novel $2a_0\times2a_0$ PDW on the kagome lattice arising from attractive on-bond pairing interactions and the distinct Bloch wave functions near the p-type van Hove singularity. The PDW state carrying three independent wave-vectors, the so-called 3Q PDW, is nodeless and falls into two topological classes characterized by the Chern number $C = 0$ or $C = \pm2$. The chiral ($C=\pm2$) PDW state presents a rare case of interaction driven topological quantum state without the requirement of spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we analyze the stabilities and properties of these PDWs intertwining with charge orders, and discuss the relevance of our minimal model to recent experimental observations in kagome superconductors. Our theory not only elucidates the driving force of the chiral PDW, but also predicts strongly anisotropic superconducting gap structure in the momentum space and quantized transverse thermal conductivity that can be tested in future experiments.</p>

However, the effects of the non-Hermiticity, arising from the coupling to the environment and dissipation, have remained unexplored. We here develop a simple non-Hermitian (NH) version of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) by considering relative twisting of two NH graphene monolayers with non-Hermiticity encoded in the imbalance of in-plane nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes. Remarkably, by generalizing the Bistritzer-MacDonald approach to NH systems, we discover exceptional magic angles where the band structure changes from purely real to purely imaginary thus featuring flat bands with infinite lifetime. Between them, the bands remain flattened, and a Hermitian magic angle emerges at which the imaginary part of energy is maximal, and corresponds to the usual magic angle in non-dissipative, purely Hermitian TBG. We propose an optical lattice setup with gain and loss where our theoretical predictions can be verified. These results suggest the robustness of the flat bands in open systems, paving the way for the further studies on the interplay of dissipative effects, electronic topology, and interactions in such NH moiré bands.</p>

            <h2>Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyakka Nakada, Kotaro Tanahashi, Shu Tanaka</p>
            <p>In this study, we propose a new method for constrained combinatorial optimization using tensor networks. Combinatorial optimization methods employing quantum gates, such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm, have been intensively investigated. However, their limitations in errors and the number of qubits prevent them from handling large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Alternatively, attempts have been made to solve larger-scale problems using tensor networks that can approximately simulate quantum states. In recent years, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. For the principle verification of the proposed method, we constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem and conducted imaginary time evolution. We found that feasible solutions were obtained during the evolution, ultimately leading to the optimal solution. The proposed method is expected to facilitate the discovery of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</p>

            <h2>Modeling of the micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ondřej Wojewoda, Martin Hrtoň, Michal Urbánek</p>
            <p>Although micro-focused Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has been used for more than twenty years, it lacks a complete theoretical description. This complicates the analysis of experimental data and significantly limits the information that can be obtained. To fill this knowledge gap, we have developed a semi-analytical model based on the mesoscopic continuous medium approach. The model consists of the following steps: calculation of the incident electric field and the dynamic susceptibility, calculation of the induced polarisation, and calculation of the emitted electric field and its propagation towards the detector. We demonstrate the model on the examples of the measurements of thermal and coherently excited spin waves. However, the used approach is general and can describe any micro-focused Brillouin light scattering experiment. The model can also bring new analytical approaches to mechanobiology experiments or to characterization of acoustic wave based devices.</p>

            <h2>One-way catalysis in a solvable lattice model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sara Mahdavi, Yann Sakref, Olivier Rivoire</p>
            <p>Catalysts speed up chemical reactions with no energy input and without being transformed in the process, therefore leaving equilibrium constants unchanged. Some catalysts, however, are much more efficient at accelerating one direction of a reaction. Is it possible for catalysis to be strictly unidirectional, accelerating only one direction of a reaction? Can we observe directional catalysis by analyzing the microscopic trajectory of a single reactant undergoing conversions between a substrate and a product state? We use the framework of a simple but exactly solvable lattice model to study these questions. The model provides examples of strictly one-way catalysts and illustrates a mathematical relationship between the asymmetric transition rates that underlie directional catalysis and the symmetric transition fluxes that underlie chemical equilibrium. The degree of directionality generally depends on the catalytic mechanism and we compare different mechanisms to show how they can obey different scaling laws.</p>

            <p>The generation and manipulation of non-classical states of light is central to quantum technologies. Color centers in insulators have been extensively studied for single-photon generation, but organic molecules immobilized on substrates have gained attention due to their superior scalability, large oscillator strengths, and tunable emission frequency. Here, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the photoemission from organic molecules adsorbed on 2D materials. Focusing on terrylene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we obtain zero phonon line (ZPL) energies and emission lineshapes in excellent agreement with experiments. Notably, antisite defects in hBN can immobilize the molecule without influencing its key emission features. We further show that the main effect of the 2D substrate is to introduce sharp sidebands near the ZPL as a fingerprint of hindered rotational, translational, or bending modes of the molecule. Our findings provide insight into how substrate interactions shape the optical properties of molecular systems for quantum applications.</p>

            <p>Persistent currents--inviscid quantized flow around an atomic circuit--are a crucial building block of atomtronic devices. We investigate how acceleration influences the transfer of persistent currents between two density-connected, ring-shaped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, joined by a tunable weak link that controls system topology. We find that the acceleration of this system modifies both the density and phase dynamics between the rings, leading to a bias in the periodic vortex oscillations studied in T. Bland et al., Phys. Rev. Research 4, 043171 (2022). Accounting for dissipation suppressing such vortex oscillations, the acceleration facilitates a unilateral vortex transfer to the leading ring. We analyze how this transfer depends on the weak-link amplitude, the initial persistent current configuration, and the acceleration strength and direction. Characterization of the sensitivity to these parameters paves the way for a new platform for acceleration measurements, for which we outline a proof-of-concept ultracold double-ring accelerometer.</p>

            <p>We use the Dirac continuum model to study the propagation of electronic wave packets in graphene with periodically arranged circular potential steps. The time propagation of the wave packets are calculated using the split-operator method for different size, height and separation of the barriers. The time propagation of the wave packets is calculated using the split-operator method for various barrier sizes, heights, and separations. We found that, despite the pronounced Klein tunneling effect in graphene, the presence of a lattice of defects significantly impacts the propagation properties of the wave packets. For example, depending on the height and size of the incident wave packet, the transmission probability can decrease by more than 20\%. The alteration of the polarity of the potential barriers also contributes to the transmission probabilities of the wave packet in graphene. The obtained results could provide valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of charge carrier dynamics in graphene-based nanodevices.</p>

            <p>We study the three-body Fermi liquid effects in the SU($N$) Anderson impurity model in the strong interaction limit where the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of the impurity levels varies over the range of $0<N_d^{}<1$. The three-body correlation of impurity electrons contributes to the next-to-leading order terms of transport coefficients at low energies when the electron-hole symmetry, the time-reversal symmetries, or both are broken by external fields or potentials. Using the numerical renormalization group approach, we calculate the differential conductance and the nonlinear current noise through quantum dots, as well as the thermal conductivity of both quantum dots and magnetic alloys. Specifically, we focus on the SU(2) and SU(4) cases and demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve in the limit of $U\to\infty$, across the $1/N$-filling Kondo regime and the valence fluctuation regime. Our results clarify how the three-body correlation affects low-energy transport, with a crucial dependence on the occupation number $N_d^{}$. We also show that the three-body correlation strongly couples with asymmetries in the tunnel couplings between quantum dots and reservoirs; in particular it significantly affects the nonlinear current through the quarter-filling Kondo state for $N=4$.</p>

            <p>Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising accident-tolerant fuel because of its high fissile density and high thermal conductivity. In this study, we developed the first machine learning interatomic potentials for reliable atomic-scale modeling of UN at finite temperatures. We constructed a training set using density functional theory (DFT) calculations that was enriched through an active learning procedure, and two neural network potentials were generated. Both potentials successfully reproduce key thermophysical properties of interest, such as temperature-dependent lattice parameter, specific heat capacity, and bulk modulus. We also evaluated the energy of stoichiometric defect reactions and defect migration barriers and found close agreement with DFT predictions, demonstrating that our potentials can be used for modeling defects in UN. Additional tests provide evidence that our potentials are reliable for simulating diffusion, noble gas impurities, and radiation damage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. D. Fedoseev, A. O. Zlotnikov</p>
            <p>Although the appearance of vortex-localized states with zero energy in first-order topological superconductors is well known, their possibility to form in the higher-order topological phase of 2D systems has not been completely uncovered yet. Here we demonstrate the coexistence of zero-energy vortex modes and Majorana corner modes in the model of a 2D second-order topological superconductor. The model describes an interface between a normal layer supporting the topological insulating phase and a superconducting layer, for which different symmetries of the spin-singlet superconducting order parameter are considered. We show that the gapless vortex modes can appear under certain conditions in the superconducting state with a vortex if the bulk energy spectrum of the normal (non-superconducting) state is gapless and has Dirac cones. The number of pairs of such vortex modes corresponds to the number of Dirac cones. It is essential that if the normal bulk spectrum becomes gapped and the system is in the state of a topological insulator, then the zero-energy vortex modes can not be realized, while Majorana corner modes hold in the superconducting state. The interaction of the vortex modes with the edge and topological corner modes is studied when the vortex appears near the boundaries.</p>

            <p>Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a noncentrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its noncentrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirm that its structure is noncentrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa, whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Emergent electrostatics in planar XY spin models: the bridge connecting topological order with broken $U(1)$ symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael F. Faulkner</p>
            <p>Topological phases have been a central focus of condensed-matter physics for over 50 years. Along with many experimental applications, they have provided much intellectual interest due to their characterization via some form of topological ordering, as opposed to the symmetry-breaking ordering of conventional continuous phase transitions. This distinction is most subtle in the case of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition as its experimental realizations appear to break U(1) symmetry at low temperature. It also presents two further paradoxes: i) its prototypical short-range interacting planar XY spin model behaves as an emergent long-range interacting electrolyte; ii) its topological ordering is not accompanied by a topological nonergodicity within the BKT picture. This review paper addresses these three interconnected questions. We review a series of papers that demonstrate that U(1) symmetry is indeed broken, but within a broader framework than that traditionally used to characterize broken symmetry. We discuss recovery of this symmetry by breaking velocity-symmetry in a deterministic Markov process. We then expand on a modern field theory of the emergent electrolyte that maps directly from the spin field to an emergent lattice electric field governed by an augmented electrostatic Boltzmann distribution. This local model of electrolyte physics resolves both the short-range-long-range paradox and the question of topological nonergodicity - as in contrast with the BKT picture, it describes global topological defects and their nonergodic freezing by the topological ordering. It also connects the broken U(1) symmetry with the topological ordering, providing a comprehensive framework for broken symmetry at the transition. We introduce long-time topological stability as a measure of topological nonergodicity - within a general framework for weakly broken ergodicity.</p>

            <p>Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge-neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ (bosonic) \updated{ and $1/3$ (fermionic) fractional Chern insulator (FCI)} on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor acquires a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. As the system approaches the FCI-to-CDW transition point, we observe a pronounced sharpening of the roton mode, suggesting that the magnetoroton behaves more like a quasiparticle as it softens. Notably, this occurs while the single-particle gap remains finite. Besides the magnetoroton at finite momentum, we also construct quadrupolar chiral operators in a discrete lattice and resolve the chiral graviton mode around the $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we show the different chiralities of the gravitons of FCIs with opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time.</p>

            <p>We investigate the terahertz conductivity of conventional superconductors in Voigt and Faraday magneto-optical configurations. First, we review theoretical approaches describing the fundamental processes of suppression of superconductivity in magnetic field and how the in-gap states are filled. In the Voigt geometry, thin superconducting films are fully penetrated by the magnetic field which interacts with the spin, thus modifying the magnitudes of the optical gap and of the density of the condensate. In this configuration, we provide an alternative description of the recent experiments showing the gapless conductivity of a Nb film measured by Lee ${\it et\,al.}$ [Nat. Commun. 14,2737 (2023)], which better fits their data for magnetic fields above 1 T. In the Faraday geometry, we measured and analyzed the terahertz conductivity of three NbN films with varying thicknesses using the Maxwell-Garnett model, treating vortices as normal-state inclusions within a superconducting matrix. In both geometries, the optical conductivity can be comprehensively described by the model of Herman and Hlubina [Phys. Rev.

            <p>The present study reports on the structure formation in thin epitaxial nickel-aluminum films (Ni1-xAlx; Al atomic fraction x up to x=0.24) grown on MgO(001) substrates by magnetron sputtering. Experimental and computational data demonstrate that for x<0.11, the films exhibit the face-centered cubic random solid-solution Ni1-xAlx structure ({\gamma}). Whereas in the range x=0.11-0.24 the phase coexists with the ordered L12 structure ({\gamma}' phase). The two phases are homogenously intermixed forming a coherent and strained nano-solution, which exhibits a single lattice parameter that expands as the Al content increases. Isothermal annealing of films containing x=0.14 of Al, coupled with structural and nano-mechanical characterization, reveal that the nano-solution retains its overall integrity for temperatures up to 673 K, while the film hardness increases from 5.5 GPa (as deposited films) to 6 GPa. Further increase of the annealing temperature to 873 K and 1073 K causes the nano-solution to dissolve into distinct {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phase domains and the hardness to decrease down to values of 4 GPa. These findings confirm the metastable nature of the as-deposited thin Ni1-xAlx alloy films and underpin the effectiveness of high supersaturation/undercooling for creating non-equilibrium phases and self-organized nanostructures upon synthesis of multicomponent materials.</p>

            <p>Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between 50 K and 75 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</p>

Previous attempts to imprint pre-defined Sks and Bms in a ferromagnet (FM) and transfer them to an AFM using interfacial exchange bias in FM/AFM heterostructures have been hindered by complex multilayers with discontinuities, polycrystallinity, or multipartite chiral AFMs. Employing atomistic spin simulations, we demonstrate the viability of texture imprinting for nucleating Sks and Bms in AFMs, using a prototypical bipartite AFM layer in a multilayer structure free from discontinuities. Such imprinting is a crucial step towards understanding the static and dynamic properties of natural antiferromagnetic textures and their unique properties.</p>

            <p>The coherent transport of time-resolved ultrafast excitations in nanoelectronic interferometers is expected to exhibit an interesting interplay between the interferences and the time-dependent drive. However, the typical frequencies required to unlock this physics are in the THz range, making its observation challenging. In this work, we consider the propagation of the excitation generated by ultrashort voltage pulses through a small quantum dot, a system which we argue can display similar physics at significantly lower frequencies. We model the system with a single resonant level connected to two infinite electrodes subjected to a time-dependent voltage bias. For short pulses, we predict that the behaviour of the dot contrasts sharply with the long pulse (adiabatic) limit: the current actually oscillates with the amplitude of the voltage pulse. In the ultrafast limit, we predict that the current can even be negative, i.e. flow against the voltage drop. Our results are obtained by a combination of two approaches that are in quantitative agreement: explicit analytical expressions in the ultrafast and ultraslow limits and exact numerical simulations. We discuss the applicability of our findings and conclude that this system should be within reach of existing experimental platforms.</p>

When we consider all possible discrete gauging operations, we obtain bosonic and fermionic webs with 9 critical theories per web, each connecting 4 separate gapped phases, some of them topological. Bosonization maps the two webs into each other. In addition to discussing the multi-critical theory connecting the four gapped phases in each phase diagram, we discuss the partially gapped theories connecting two of those four.

            <p>Two-particle interferometry is an important tool for extracting the exchange statistics of quantum particles. We theoretically investigate the prospects of such interferometry to probe the statistics of point-like anyonic excitations injected in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setup based on a quantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the standard HOM ratio, i.e., the ratio of tunneling noises for two- and one-particle injections, and find that for point-like anyons, it only depends on the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension. Importantly, the latter is not necessarily related to the exchange phase. In fact, we establish that the HOM ratio does not reveal the exchange phase of the injected anyons: For injection-time delays that are small compared to the thermal time scale, we find that the exchange phase accumulated due to time-domain braiding between injected and thermally activated anyons is erased due to two mutually canceling sub-processes. In contrast, for time delays large compared to the thermal time, only a single sub-process contributes to the braiding, but the accumulated phase is canceled in the HOM ratio. These findings suggest caution when interpreting HOM interferometry experiments with anyons and approaches beyond the standard HOM ratio are thus necessary to extract anyonic statistics with two-particle interferometry experiments.</p>

            <p>Crystal symmetry plays a fundamental role in determining its physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. However, this is often inadequately addressed by existing generative models, making the consistent generation of stable and symmetrically valid crystal structures a significant challenge. We introduce WyFormer, a generative model that directly tackles this by formally conditioning on space group symmetry. It achieves this by using Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer encoder and an absence of positional encoding. Extensive experimentation demonstrates WyFormer's compelling combination of attributes: it achieves best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, incorporates a physics-motivated inductive bias, produces structures with competitive stability, predicts material properties with competitive accuracy even without atomic coordinates, and exhibits unparalleled inference speed.</p>

            <h2>A simple method for detection and quantitative estimation of deep levels in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures by analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maciej Matys, Atsushi Yamada, Yoichi Kamada, Toshihiro Ohki</p>
            <p>The characterization of deep levels in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures is one of the most important problems in GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) technology. This work reports on a technique for determination of deep level concentration in AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. The proposed method is relatively simple, and it is based on the detection of free holes created by optically induced transitions of electrons from the deep levels to the conduction band. The developed method can detect and provide quantitative estimation of deep level traps in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. Furthermore, it provides a framework for analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift, which includes an important experimental criterion of determination whether the holes are generated or not in the AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures by sub-band gap illumination. The method was verified by applications it to a study of the deep levels in GaN HEMTs grown on various substrates, i.e. SiC and GaN.</p>

            <p>Optical excitation of large-amplitude apical oxygen phonon oscillations has been shown to renormalize the electronic properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, inducing a superconducting-like optical response above equilibrium $T_C$. All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into a superconducting-like inductive response. This assignment was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report the first experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties, which has so far been elusive due to the high equilibrium reflectivity and the need to evaluate minute changes in the optical response. We report the appearance of a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2\Delta\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, both consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.</p>

Given the value of the Hall conductivity, we constrain the global symmetry of the low-energy theory and its anomaly.

This information is powerful enough to lead to a unique minimal topological order (or a small number of minimal topological orders). Almost all of the known experimentally discovered topological orders are these minimal theories. Since this work is interdisciplinary, we made a special effort to relate to people with different backgrounds by providing translations between different perspectives.</p>

            <p>This study explores the potential of MoS$_2$ polymorphs, specifically the semiconducting 2H phase and the metallic 1T$^\prime$ phase, as anchoring materials to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li--S) batteries. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$ exhibits stronger Li--S interactions, greater charge transfer, and enhanced catalytic activity compared to its 2H counterpart, effectively suppressing polysulfide dissolution and facilitating redox reactions. The reversible 2H$\leftrightarrow$1T$^\prime$ transition offers a tunable design space for balancing conductivity and structural stability. These findings position hybrid MoS$_2$ architectures as promising platforms for next-generation Li--S batteries with improved energy density, cycling stability, and rate capability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. W. González, T. Brumme, E. Suárez Morell, A. M. León</p>
            <p>Altermagnetic materials combine compensated magnetic order with momentum-dependent spin splitting, offering a fundamentally new route for spintronic functionality beyond conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. While most studies have focused on three-dimensional compounds, the emergence of altermagnetism in few-layer two-dimensional materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that bilayer MnPS$_3$, a prototypical 2D van der Waals magnet, can host stacking-induced altermagnetic phases. Using density-functional theory and spin-Laue symmetry analysis, we show that interlayer spin alignment and lateral displacement act as coupled symmetry control parameters that switch the system between Type II (collinear AFM) and Type III (altermagnetic) phases. Our systematic exploration reveals how specific stacking geometries enable momentum-dependent spin polarization without net magnetization, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. These results establish stacking engineering as a powerful, purely structural route for designing tunable altermagnetic states in 2D magnets, opening pathways toward symmetry-driven spintronic and magnetoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Liouvillian skin effects in two-dimensional electron systems at finite temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Shigedomi, Tsuneya Yoshida</p>
            <p>Liouvillian skin effects, manifested as the localization of Liouvillian eigenstates around the boundary, are distinctive features of non-Hermitian systems and are particularly notable for their impact on system dynamics. Despite their significance, Liouvillian skin effects have not been sufficiently explored in electron systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional electron system on a substrate exhibits $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Liouvillian skin effects due to the interplay among energy dissipations, spin-orbit coupling, and a transverse magnetic field. In addition, our analysis of the temperature dependence reveals that these Liouvillian skin effects become pronounced below the energy scale of band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field. While our $\mathbb{Z}$ Liouvillian skin effect leads to charge accumulation under quench dynamics, its relaxation time is independent of the system size, in contrast to that of previously reported Liouvillian skin effects. This difference is attributed to the scale-free behavior of the localization length, which is analogous to non-Hermitian critical skin effects.</p>

            <p>We investigated the origin of collective electronic phase transitions induced at the heterointerface between monoclinic insulating (MI) VO2 and rutile metallic (RM) electron-doped VO2 layers using in situ soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPES) on nanoscale VO2/V0.99W0.01O2 (001)R bilayers. Thanks to the surface sensitivity of SXPES, we determined the changes in the electronic structure and V-V dimerization in each constituent layer separately. The layer-selective observation of the electronic and crystal structures in the upper VO2 layer of the bilayer indicates that the MI-phase VO2 layer undergoes a transition to the RM phase by forming the heterointerface. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the RM-phase VO2 undergoes a transition to the MI phase with a decrease in temperature, as in the case of a VO2 single-layer film. Furthermore, during the temperature-induced phase transition in the VO2 layer, the spectra are well described by an in-plane phase separation of the RM and MI phases. These results suggest that the interface-induced transition from the MI to the RM phase in the VO2 layer of bilayers occurs as a collective phase transition derived from the static energy balance between the interfacial energy and the bulk free energies of the constituent layers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Vieweg, V. Kott, L. Lenke, A. Schellenberger, K.P. Schmidt</p>
            <p>We investigate the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code which corresponds to the $U(1)$-symmetry enriched toric code with two distinct star sublattices. One can therefore tune from the limit of isolated stars to the uniform system. The uniform system has been conjectured to possess non-Abelian topological order based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggesting a non-trivial ground-state degeneracy depending on the compactification of the finite clusters. Here we show that these non-trivial properties can be naturally explained in the perturbative limit of isolated stars. Indeed, the compactification dependence of the ground-state degeneracy can be traced back to geometric constraints stemming from the plaquette operators. Further, the ground-state degeneracy is fully lifted in fourth-order degenerate perturbation theory giving rise to a non-topological phase with confined fracton excitations. These fractons are confined for small perturbations so that they cannot exist as single low-energy excitation in the thermodynamic limit but only as topologically trivially composite particles. However, the confinement scale is shown to be surprisingly large so that finite-size gaps are extremely small on finite clusters up to the uniform limit which is calculated explicitly by high-order series expansions. Our findings suggest that these gaps were not distinguished from finite-size effects by the recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the uniform limit. All our results therefore point towards the absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code along the whole parameter axis.</p>

            <p>Here, we report a prominent quantum oscillation in the conductance of 2H-MoTe2 based resonant tunneling structure. In this work, a n-WSe2/HfO2/i-MoTe2/HfO2/Au resonant tunneling device (RTD) with a symmetric and asymmetric double barrier has been fabricated using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) grown 2H-MoTe2 and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) grown 2H-WSe2 along with theoretical modeling by adopting non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) formalism. The impact of MoTe2-quantum well widths equal, and above its excitonic Bohr radius (EBR:0.7 nm) on resonant tunneling current is investigated at cryogenic temperatures. Such peak values increase with downscaling of the well width up to a certain value and then it decreases with further miniaturization. The corresponding maximum peak-to-valley current ratio (PVR) is estimated to be 4 at 4K in the low voltage range for the very first time in MoTe2 based RTD. Therefore, the present work may provide the route for fabrication of WSe2/MoTe2-based high performance resonant tunneling devices integrable with HEMT device for modern Qubit architecture operational at ultra-low temperatures.</p>

            <p>Superconducting thin films and layered crystals display a Nernst signal generated by short-lived Cooper pairs above their critical temperature. Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body methods provide a systematic route to computing electronic properties of molecules and materials, but high computational costs restrict their use in large-scale applications. Due to the complexity in many-electron wavefunctions, machine learning models capable of capturing fundamental many-body physics remain limited. Here, we present a deep learning framework targeting the many-body Green's function, which unifies predictions of electronic properties in ground and excited states, while offering physical insights into many-electron correlation effects. By learning the $GW$ or coupled-cluster self-energy from mean-field features, our graph neural network achieves competitive performance in predicting one- and two-particle excitations and quantities derivable from one-particle density matrix. We demonstrate its high data efficiency and good transferability across chemical species, system sizes, molecular conformations, and correlation strengths in bond breaking, through multiple molecular and nanomaterial benchmarks.

            <p>We establish a correspondence between the fault-tolerance of local stabilizer codes experiencing measurement and physical errors and the mixed-state phases of decohered resource states in one higher dimension. Drawing from recent developments in mixed-state phases of matter, this motivates a diagnostic of fault-tolerance, which we refer to as the spacetime Markov length. This is a length scale determined by the decay of the (classical) conditional mutual information of repeated syndrome measurement outcomes in spacetime. The diagnostic is independent of the decoder, and its divergence signals the intrinsic breakdown of fault tolerance. As a byproduct, we find that decoherence may be useful for exposing transitions from higher-form symmetry-protected topological phases driven by both incoherent and coherent perturbations.</p>

            <p>Closed-form expressions for the average amplitude of the optical field in optomechanical systems are obtained, in which, in addition to the linear interaction, quadratic and cubic interactions of the vibrational mode of the mechanical resonator with the mode of the optical resonator are considered. In the framework of the non-secular perturbation theory, using the Bogoliubov averaging method, it is shown that the effects of photon blockade, collapse and revival of optical oscillations in such systems can be realized. The main contribution to the formation of revivals is provided by the Kerr self-action of the optical mode and the cross-Kerr interaction of the fourth degree in optical and mechanical amplitudes. The cross-Kerr interactions of the sixth- and eighth-order in amplitudes destroy the regular structure of revivals. The influence of these cross-Kerr nonlinearities disappears with an increase in the decay rate of the optical mode and is also completely suppressed at zero temperature. It is shown that the asymmetry of the spectral line of the optical field intensity in the cavity is most pronounced with an increase in the degree of nonlinearity and is explained by Fano interference.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mason Kamb, Surya Ganguli</p>
            <p>We obtain an analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-matching diffusion models can generate highly original images that lie far from their training data. However, optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching; (2) result in fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, local score (LS) and equivariant local score (ELS) machines that, (3) after calibrating a single time-dependent hyperparameter can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and UNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.95, 0.94, 0.94, 0.96$ for our top model on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, MNIST, and CelebA). Our model reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic mechanism of creativity, in which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local training set patches at different scales and image locations. Our theory also partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled UNets (median $r^2 \sim 0.77$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role for attention in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.</p>

            <p>We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to generate classical moments from the correlation function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 \equiv \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of limited data on training pairwise energy-based models for inverse problems aimed at identifying interaction networks. Utilizing the Gaussian model as testbed, we dissect training trajectories across the eigenbasis of the coupling matrix, exploiting the independent evolution of eigenmodes and revealing that the learning timescales are tied to the spectral decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix. We see that optimal points for early stopping arise from the interplay between these timescales and the initial conditions of training. Moreover, we show that finite data corrections can be accurately modeled through asymptotic random matrix theory calculations and provide the counterpart of generalized cross-validation in the energy based model context. Our analytical framework extends to binary-variable maximum-entropy pairwise models with minimal variations. These findings offer strategies to control overfitting in discrete-variable models through empirical shrinkage corrections, improving the management of overfitting in energy-based generative models. Finally, we propose a generalization to arbitrary energy-based models by deriving the neural tangent kernel dynamics of the score function under the score-matching algorithm.</p>

            <p>We introduce a platform to achieve ultra-strong coupling (USC) between light and matter using widely available materials. USC is a light-matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths exceeding 10% of the ground state energy. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single-photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low-threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q-factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here we leverage dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate USC to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra-thin SiO2 layer. The strong out-of-plane electric fields in our tapered bar structure overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode, resulting in a normalized coupling strength of 0.101 and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the ENZ mode energy; a four- to five-fold increase compared to previous approaches. The strong field confinement of our approach opens new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices, such as tunable frequency converters and low-energy optical modulators.</p>

In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.</p>

            <p>The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. For $N=3$, we investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch. We compute the anomalous dimension of the lightest operator that could participate in recombination, and find that it remains too heavy to allow for this scenario. This suggests that the NLSM $O(3)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(3)$ CFT, and may instead describe an alternative universality class, such as the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, corresponding to the Néel-VBS phase transition in $3$D. We also discuss how to generalize this analysis to $N>3$.</p>

            <p>Templated porous materials, such as MCM-41, due to the uniformity of their onedimensional structure and scalability in synthesis, have emerged as an attractive medium for studying one-dimensional quantum fluids. However, the experimental challenge of synthesizing these materials with pore radii smaller than 15 Angstroms hinders the realization of a one-dimensional quantum liquid of helium within such systems, as the coherence length of helium is shorter than the pore radius. Recently, DelMaestro et. al. have preplated MCM-41 with Ar resulting in a reduction of the pore size and a softening of the adsorption potential allowing them to observe 1D Tomanga-Luttinger liquid like behavior. In this paper we present a novel method to obtain an even more ideal environment for studying the behavior of 1D 4He. We propose preplating MCM-41 pores with cesium (Cs) metal. The non-wetting nature of helium on a Cs-coated surface, coupled with the large atomic radius of cesium, creates an optimal environment for confining a quantum liquid of helium in one-dimensional geometry. We present preliminary measurements of adsorption isotherms and Small Angle X-ray Scattering studies that 1reveal a reduction in pore radius upon preplating MCM-41 with Cs, demonstrating promising prospects for facilitating the realization of one-dimensional quantum fluids in templated porous materials.</p>

            <h2>Phonon-Mediated Intrinsic Topological Superconductivity in Fermi Arcs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Mæland, Masoud Bahari, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>We propose that phonons can mediate topological superconductivity on the surface of Weyl semimetals. Weyl semimetals are gapless topological materials with nondegenerate zero energy surface states known as Fermi arcs. We derive the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling in an effective model of a Weyl semimetal and apply weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In a slab geometry, we demonstrate that surface superconductivity dominates over bulk superconductivity in a wide range of chemical potentials. The superconducting gap function realizes spinless chiral $p$-wave superconductivity in the Fermi arcs, leading to Majorana bound states in the core of vortices. Furthermore, we show a suppression of the absolute value of the gap in the center of the arc, which is not captured by a local Hubbard attraction. The suppression is due to the nonlocal origin of electron-phonon coupling, leading to a layer dependence which has important consequences for topological surface states.</p>

            <p>The control of out-of-equilibrium electron dynamics in topological insulators is essential to unlock their potential in next-generation quantum technologies. However, the role of temperature on the renormalization of the electronic band structure and, consequently, on electron scattering processes is still elusive. Here, using high-resolution time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES), we show that even a modest ($\sim$15 meV) renormalization of the conduction band of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ can critically affect bulk and surface electron scattering processes. Supported by a kinetic Monte Carlo toy-model, we show that temperature-induced changes in the bulk band structure modulate the intervalley electron-phonon scattering rate, reshaping the out-of-equilibrium response. This work establishes temperature as an effective control knob for engineering scattering pathways in topological insulators.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetic polarons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Daghofer, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Jeroen van den Brink</p>
            <p>While a spin-dependent band splitting is one of the characteristic features of altermagnets, the conventional band picture itself breaks down in the many altermagnets that are correlated Mott materials. We employ two numerical many-body methods, the self-consistent Born approximation and variational cluster approach, to explore this strongly correlated regime and investigate hole motion in Mott altermagnets. Our results reveal that spin-dependent spectral-weight transfer is the dominant signature of Mott altermagnetism. This pronounced spin-momentum locking of the quasiparticle spectral weight arises from the formation of altermagnetic polarons, whose dynamics are governed by the interplay between free hole motion and the coupling of the hole to magnon excitations in the altermagnet. We demonstrate this effect by calculating ARPES spectra for two canonical altermagnetic systems: the checkerboard $J$-$J'$ model and the Kugel-Khomskii spin-orbital altermagnet based on cubic vanadates $R$VO$_3$ ($R$=La, Pr, Nd, Y).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Lanzini, Purnendu Das, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism has emerged as an unconventional form of collinear magnetism with spatial rotational symmetries, that give rise to strongly spin-split bands despite of an underlying fully-compensated antiferromagnetic order. Here, we develop a theory for the Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) response of altermagnetic Mott insulators. Crucially, the spectrum does not simply reflect the non-interacting band structure, but instead a magnetic polaron is formed at low energies, that can be interpreted as a spinon-holon bound state. We develop a spinon-holon parton theory and predict a renormalized bandwidth that we confirm by tensor network simulations. We analyze the characteristic spin-split spectrum and identify a spin-dependent spectral weight of the magnetic polaron, resulting from the altermagnetic symmetry. Our work paves the way for a systematic study of doping effects and correlation phenomena in altermagnetic Mott insulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Chen, Yijia Wu, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p>The hybrid system of a conventional superconductor (SC) on a semiconductor (SM) nanowire with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) represents a promising platform for achieving topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) towards topological quantum computation. While aluminum (Al)-based hybrid nanowire devices have been widely utilized, their limited superconducting gap and intrinsic weak SOC as well as small Landé g-factor may hinder future experimental advancements. In contrast, we demonstrate that lead (Pb)-based hybrid quantum devices exhibit a remarkably large and hard proximity-induced superconducting gap, exceeding that of Al by an order of magnitude. By exploiting electrostatic gating to modulate wavefunction distribution and SC-SM interfacial coupling, this gap can be continuously tuned from its maximum value (~1.4 meV, matching the bulk Pb gap) down to nearly zero while maintaining the hardness. Furthermore, magnetic-field-dependent measurements reveal a radial evolution of the gap structure with anti-crossing feature, indicative of strong SOC and huge effective g-factors up to 76. These findings underscore the superior functionality of Pb-based hybrid systems, significantly advancing their potential for realizing and stabilizing MZMs and the further scalable topological quantum architectures.</p>

            <p>Correlated transition metal oxides, such as cuprates, nickelates, and manganites, are typically considered "bad metals", where high electromagnetic losses suppress the conventional plasmonic effects observed in noble metals, 2D electron gases, and graphene. Nevertheless, using mid-infrared near-field optical nanoscopy, we demonstrate the emergence of strongly confined and long-propagating edge polaritons (EPs) of mixed phonon-plasmon nature at the boundaries between conducting and insulating regions in thin NdNiO$_{3}$ films, fingerprinted as a pronounced peak of the near-field signal phase. Our simulations reveal that the electromagnetic nature of the EPs depends significantly on the edge smoothness, being caused by a one-dimensional optical edge state (ES) at abrupt edges while being governed by the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) absorption in the case of broad boundaries. Our findings highlight the critical role of nonlocal plasmonic effects in near-field imaging of phase-separated correlated oxides and open new avenues for infrared plasmonics in this family of materials.</p>

            <p>Due to recent advances, silicon solar cells are rapidly approaching the Shockley-Queisser limit of 33% efficiency. Quantum Dot (QD) solar cells have the potential to surpass this limit and enable a new generation of photovoltaic technologies beyond the capabilities of any existing solar energy modalities. The creation of the first epitaxially-fused quantum dot solids showing broad phase coherence and metallicity necessary for solar implementation has not yet been achieved, and the metal-insulator transition in these materials needs to be explored. We have created a new model of electron transport through QD solids, informed by 3D-tomography of QD solid samples, which considers disorder in both the on-site and hopping terms of the commonly studied Anderson Hamiltonian. We used the transfer matrix method and finite-size scaling to create a dynamic metal-insulator transition phase diagram. For a surprisingly large portion of the parameter space, our model shows a critical exponent distinct from the expected value for the Anderson transition. We show the existence of a crossover region from the universality class of the Anderson transition (AI) to the Chiral Orthogonal class (BDI) due to the addition of weak kinetic (hopping) disorder.</p>

By tuning the optical trap profile via excitation lasers intensity, we precisely control the resonance width.

Exploiting the giant nonlinear interactions of exciton polaritons we observe compactly localised solitons (compactons) embedded within the continuum of propagating state bands - a form of nonlinear bound state in the continuum (BIC). The driven-dissipative nature of the system leads to a sudden self-localisation into the compacton state above a threshold power. The experimental results agree well with numerical simulations. These results have implications for the physics of interacting quantum particles in flat-band systems and for generation of quantum-correlated light and spatially multiplexed coherent information transport.</p>

            <p>Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate thin film superconductors discovered under ambient pressure enable vast possibilities for investigating electronic structures of the superconducting state. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 films grown on SrLaAlO4 substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced p-d hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest potential for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.</p>

            <p>We employ the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. The spins on all lattice sites are chosen to transform under the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ irreducible representation with a single row and $k$ boxes in the Young tableau. It is demonstrated that the wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ series are derived. The $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the $k=2$ member hosts Fibonacci anyons.</p>

            <p>The skyrmion number density, $q\equiv\vec{n}\cdot\left(\partial_x\vec{n}\times\partial_y\vec{n}\right)/(4\pi)$, is one of the key quantities that characterizes the topological properties of a magnetic skyrmion. In this work, we propose a model for a two-dimensional magnetic system with Hamiltonian that contains an interaction term proportional to $q^2$ which preserves inversion symmetry. The proposed $q^2$ term is also known as the Skyrme term and is a two-dimensional version of the well-known quartic term in models of three-dimensional Hopfions. In contrast with the usual exchange interaction, the $q^2$ term persists at the strong external magnetic field limit. Using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for micromagnetic calculations, we show that the minimum energy configuration of this model exhibits skyrmion properties. Furthermore, this configuration remains stable under small linear radially symmetric perturbations, and we demonstrate that the total energy of the system is bounded from below, ensuring that it remains above the vacuum energy. This implies a topologically protected configuration. Our model provides a framework for describing skyrmions in materials without broken inversion symmetry, particularly in systems subjected to strong external magnetic fields, where conventional exchange interactions are significantly weaker than the Zeeman effect.</p>

            <p>The string-net model describes a vast family of topological orders in two spatial dimensions. Here, we consider the effect of thermal fluctuations on these topological phases. In the original string-net model, the description of charge (vertex) excitations can be problematic. Therefore, in order to describe all anyon excitations, we study an extended model [Y. Hu et al., Phys. Rev. B 97, 195154 (2018)]. Building on recent methods, we compute the spectral degeneracies of excited states and obtain the exact partition function. In the thermodynamic limit, the latter is dominated by the trivial (vacuum) anyon, so that topological order is destroyed at any nonzero temperature. In contrast, in a finite-size system, order survives up to a finite temperature, revealing a nontrivial scaling between temperature and size similar to that of the one-dimensional classical Ising model. We confirm this scaling by computing the thermal average of several observables such as Wegner-Wilson loops and topological mutual information.</p>

            <p>The complex surface impedance is a well-established tool to study the super- and normal-fluid responses of superconductors. Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe$_2$ single crystals as a function of temperature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resistivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe$_2$, we find an isotropic $\Delta \lambda(T) \sim T^\alpha$ power-law temperature dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for $T\le T_c/3$ with $\alpha < 2$, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance $R_s(T) \sim T^{\alpha_R}$ with $\alpha_R < 2$. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more. We compare to predictions for topological Weyl superconductivity in the context of the observed isotropic power-laws, and anisotropy of the residual loss.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Lama, Mario di Bernardo, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Field theories for complex systems traditionally focus on collective behaviors emerging from simple, reciprocal pairwise interaction rules. However, many natural and artificial systems exhibit behaviors driven by microscopic decision-making processes that introduce both nonreciprocity and many-body interactions, challenging these conventional approaches. We develop a theoretical framework to incorporate decision-making into field theories using the shepherding control problem as a paradigmatic example of a multi-agent control system, where agents (herders) must coordinate to confine another group of agents (targets) within a prescribed region. By introducing continuous approximations of two key decision-making elements - target selection and trajectory planning - we derive field equations that capture the essential features of this distributed control problem. Our theory reveals that different decision-making strategies emerge at the continuum level, from average attraction to highly selective choices, and from undirected to goal-oriented motion, driving transitions between homogeneous and confined configurations. The resulting nonreciprocal field theory not only describes the shepherding problem but provides a general framework for incorporating decision-making into continuum theories of collective behavior, with implications for applications ranging from robotic swarms to crowd management systems.</p>

Lagoin, $\textit{et al.}$, Nature $\textbf{609}$, 485 (2022)], we study a one-dimensional version of the two-component extended Bose-Hubbard model via the density-matrix renormalization group method. By using the nearest-neighbor and on-site interaction parameters from the experiment, we start by mapping the quantum phase diagram in the hopping parameters $t_{A}\mbox{-}t_{B}$ plane with boson densities $\rho_{A}=\rho_{B}=1/2$. In addition to the density wave phase reported in the experiment, we find several regimes of superfluidity when one or two hopping parameters are large enough, and interestingly there is a supercounterfluid phase at moderate and comparable hopping parameters. The universality classes of these phase transitions are analyzed from the correlation functions, excitation gaps, and entanglement entropy. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type is recognized several gapped-to-gapless transitions. In addition, we also study the quantum phase transitions when varying $\rho_{B}$ from 0 to 1 while keeping $\rho_A = 1/2$. We identify a supersolid phase in a wide range of $1/2<\rho_B<1$.

The breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law is most pronounced near charge neutrality, where the Lorenz ratio can exceed its nominal universal Sommerfeld value by an order of magnitude. The corresponding Lorenz ratios exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the magnetic field, which is caused by emergent magnetic friction arising in liquids lacking Galilean invariance and possessing finite intrinsic conductivity.</p>

            <p>Surface states of a tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on a diamond lattice of finite thickness are investigated. We consider systems with (001), (110), and (111) surfaces. Even if the surface direction is fixed, there is freedom to choose the surface structure due to the two-sublattice nature of a diamond lattice. The existence of surface states is governed by the topology of the matrix elements of the bulk Hamiltonian. In this sense, the existence of surface states is determined by the bulk Hamiltonian. However, the matrix elements depend on the choice of the unit cell, which should be chosen to conform to the surface structure. Thus, the surface states depend on the surface structure. We find that for each surface direction, there are two choices of surface structure, and depending on the chosen structure, the corresponding surface states emerge in distinct regions of the surface Brillouin zone.</p>

            <h2>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Dong Lin, Long Zhang</p>
            <p>The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>NCoder -- A Quantum Field Theory approach to encoding data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David S. Berman, Marc S. Klinger, Alexander G. Stapleton</p>
            <p>In this paper we present a novel approach to interpretable AI inspired by Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which we call the NCoder. The NCoder is a modified autoencoder neural network whose latent layer is prescribed to be a subset of $n$-point correlation functions. Regarding images as draws from a lattice field theory, this architecture mimics the task of perturbatively constructing the effective action of the theory order by order in an expansion using Feynman diagrams. Alternatively, the NCoder may be regarded as simulating the procedure of statistical inference whereby high dimensional data is first summarized in terms of several lower dimensional summary statistics (here the $n$-point correlation functions), and subsequent out-of-sample data is generated by inferring the data generating distribution from these statistics. In this way the NCoder suggests a fascinating correspondence between perturbative renormalizability and the sufficiency of models. We demonstrate the efficacy of the NCoder by applying it to the generation of MNIST images, and find that generated images can be correctly classified using only information from the first three $n$-point functions of the image distribution.</p>

            <h2>How Much Entanglement Is Needed for Topological Codes and Mixed States with Anomalous Symmetry?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Li, Dongjin Lee, Beni Yoshida</p>
            <p>It is known that particles with exotic properties can emerge in systems made of simple constituents such as qubits, due to long-range quantum entanglement. In this paper, we provide quantitative characterizations of entanglement necessary for emergent anyons and fermions by using the geometric entanglement measure (GEM), which quantifies the maximal overlap between a given state and any short-range-entangled states. For systems with emergent anyons, based on the braiding statistics, we show that the GEM scales linearly in the system size regardless of microscopic details. The phenomenon of emergent anyons can also be understood within the framework of quantum error correction (QEC). Specifically, we show that the GEM of any 2D stabilizer codes must be at least quadratic in the code distance. Our proof is based on a generic prescription for constructing string operators, establishing a rigorous and direct connection between emergent anyons and QEC. For systems with emergent fermions, despite that the ground state subspaces could be exponentially huge and their coding properties could be rather poor, we show that the GEM also scales linearly in the system size. Our analysis establishes an intriguing link between quantum anomaly and entanglement: A quantum state respecting anomalous 1-form symmetries, must be long-range-entangled and have large GEM. Our results also extend to mixed states, such as the $ZX$-dephased toric code, providing a provably nontrivial class of intrinsically mixed-state phases.</p>

            <h2>Time-resolved Stochastic Dynamics of Quantum Thermal Machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhaya S. Hegde, Patrick P. Potts, Gabriel T. Landi</p>
            <p>Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We analyze the statistics of individual cycle types and their durations, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of a given type. Central to our analysis is the notion of intermittency, which captures the operational consistency of the machine by assessing the frequency and distribution of idle cycles. Our framework offers a novel approach to characterizing thermal machines with significant relevance to experiments involving mesoscopic transport through quantum dots.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Bao Wang, Zi-Hao Dong, Yi Zhang</p>
            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking generally circumvents one-dimensional systems with local interactions in thermal equilibrium. Here, we analyze a category of one-dimensional Hermitian models via local non-Hermitian constructions. Notably, spontaneous symmetry breaking and long-range order may emerge at finite temperatures in such systems under periodic boundary conditions, in sharp contrast to Hermitian constructions. We demonstrate clear numerical evidence, such as order parameters and specific heat, supporting phase diagrams with robust ordered phases. Non-Hermitian physics plays a vital role in prohibiting domain-wall proliferation and promoting spontaneous symmetry breaking. The fermions exhibit an exotic topological nature in their path-integral windings, which uphold nonzero integers -- commonly a non-Hermitian signature -- in the ordered phases, thus offering a novel and spontaneous origin for both symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Statistics on Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Yuyang Li, Hanyu Xue, Po-Shen Hsin, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>Statistics of excitations play an essential role in understanding phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the generalized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in lattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a sequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling local ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using the Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants. Our method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and loops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations. The statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized global symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on lattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range entangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in microscopic lattice models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hisanori Oshima, Ken Mochizuki, Ryusuke Hamazaki, Yohei Fuji</p>
            <p>Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a wide variety of entanglement phases. Here, we propose a general framework based on Lyapunov analysis to characterize topological properties in monitored quantum systems through their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We illustrate this framework by analyzing (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which are known to exhibit topological and trivial area-law entangled phases as well as a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement. Through the Lyapunov analysis, we identify the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our framework thus provides a general route to extend the notion of bulk-edge correspondence to monitored quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of limited data on training pairwise energy-based models for inverse problems aimed at identifying interaction networks. Utilizing the Gaussian model as testbed, we dissect training trajectories across the eigenbasis of the coupling matrix, exploiting the independent evolution of eigenmodes and revealing that the learning timescales are tied to the spectral decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix. We see that optimal points for early stopping arise from the interplay between these timescales and the initial conditions of training. Moreover, we show that finite data corrections can be accurately modeled through asymptotic random matrix theory calculations and provide the counterpart of generalized cross-validation in the energy based model context. Our analytical framework extends to binary-variable maximum-entropy pairwise models with minimal variations. These findings offer strategies to control overfitting in discrete-variable models through empirical shrinkage corrections, improving the management of overfitting in energy-based generative models. Finally, we propose a generalization to arbitrary energy-based models by deriving the neural tangent kernel dynamics of the score function under the score-matching algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammadhossein Dadgar, Christopher L. Baldwin</p>
            <p>Inhomogeneous quantum annealing (IQA), in which transverse fields are turned off one by one rather than simultaneously, has been proposed as an effective way to avoid the first-order phase transitions that impede conventional quantum annealing (QA). Here we explicitly study the dynamics of IQA, rather than merely the thermodynamics, and find that it is appreciably slower than the phase diagram would suggest. Interestingly, this slowdown manifests both when IQA succeeds in circumventing phase transitions and when it fails. Even in the absence of transitions, such as for the mean-field models that have been analyzed previously, IQA is slower than expected by a factor of the number of spins $N$. More significantly, we show that in non-mean-field models, first-order transitions are likely to be quite common, and the gap at such transitions is not merely exponential in $N$ but exactly zero. Thus IQA cannot reach the ground state on any timescale. Both of these results can be understood through the simple observation that a spin's magnetization becomes conserved once its field is turned off during the IQA protocol.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Yu Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu</p>
            <p>Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana modes, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose a novel experimental scheme for the quantum simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding statistics in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the topologically ordered ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding of parafermions, and show the application of this approach to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermions. We also examine the real experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility of our scheme in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulations of topological defects in SC qubits to qudit systems and opens up a promising way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</p>

            <p>Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of obtaining a given state starting from a typically unentangled state. In this work, we show that complexity, when defined through the minimization of a Riemannian cost functional over the manifold of Gaussian states, provides the same information as quantum fidelity and is therefore capable of detecting quantum phase transitions. However, it does not offer a more refined analysis than entanglement entropy for a given state. We conclude that incorporating a notion of spatial locality into the computation of complexity is essential to uncover new physics beyond what is accessible through entanglement entropy and fidelity.</p>

An analytical solution exists for the transient heat conduction in an infinite rod with a delta function heat input, but no analytical solution exists for short rods or for long duration heat inputs. Our apparatus is a copper rod with a heater and thermometers attached to the rod. The temperature of the metal rod due to transient heat conduction can be modeled using a simple numerical simulation and the finite centered difference method. Using a 22 cm long copper rod with the ends thermally sunk in aluminum blocks, we show poor agreement between the experimental results and the infinite-rod analytical model, but excellent agreement between the experimental results and our numerical simulation. This experiment shows the power of a numerical simulation but also the limitations of the chosen model, which can be used as motivation for further exploration.</p>

            <h2>Scrambling Dynamics with Imperfections in a Solvable Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadie Yiluo LiTenn, Tianci Zhou, Brian Swingle</p>
            <p>We study how probes of quantum scrambling dynamics respond to two kinds of imperfections -- unequal forward and backward evolutions and decoherence -- in a solvable Brownian circuit model. We calculate a ``renormalized'' out-of-time-order correlator (ROTOC) in the model with $N$ qubits, and we show that the circuit-averaged ROTOC is controlled by an effective probability distribution in operator weight space which obeys a system of $N$ non-linear equations of motion. These equations can be easily solved numerically for large system sizes which are beyond the reach of exact methods. Moreover, for an operator initially concentrated on weight one $w_0=1$, we provide an exact solution to the equations in the thermodynamic limit of many qubits that is valid for all times, all non-vanishing perturbation strengths $p\gtrsim 1/\sqrt{N}$, and all decoherence strengths. We also show that a generic initial condition $w_0 >1$ leads to a metastable state that eventually collapses to the $w_0=1$ case after a lifetime $\sim \log(N/w_0)$. Our results highlight situations where it is still possible to extract the unperturbed chaos exponent even in the presence of imperfections, and we comment on the applications of our results to existing experiments with nuclear spins and to future scrambling experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haotian Hang, Chenchen Huang, Alex Barnett, Eva Kanso</p>
            <p>The remarkable cohesion and coordination observed in moving animal groups and their collective responsiveness to threats are thought to be mediated by scale-free correlations, where changes in the behavior of one animal influence others in the group, regardless of the distance between them. But are these features independent of group size? Here, we investigate group cohesiveness and collective responsiveness in computational models of massive schools of fish of up to 50,000 individuals. We show that as the number of swimmers increases, flow interactions destabilize the school, creating clusters that constantly fragment, disperse, and regroup, similar to their biological counterparts. We calculate the spatial correlation and speed of information propagation in these dynamic clusters. Spatial correlations in cohesive and polarized clusters are indeed scale free, much like in natural animal groups, but fragmentation events are preceded by a decrease in correlation length, thus diminishing the group's collective responsiveness, leaving it more vulnerable to predation events. Importantly, in groups undergoing collective turns, the information about the change in direction propagates linearly in time among group members, thanks to the non-reciprocal nature of the visual interactions between individuals. Merging speeds up the transfer of information within each cluster by several fold, while fragmentation slows it down. Our findings suggest that flow interactions may have played an important role in group size regulation, behavioral adaptations, and dispersion in living animal groups.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Benini, Victor Carmona, Pieter Naaijkens, Alexander Schenkel</p>
            <p>This paper presents a conceptual and efficient geometric framework to encode the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors of an algebraic quantum field theory on the $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. It is shown that, under certain assumptions which are implied by Haag duality, the monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of localized superselection sectors carry the structure of a locally constant prefactorization algebra over the category of cone-shaped subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing techniques from higher algebra, one extracts from this datum an underlying locally constant prefactorization algebra defined on open disks in the cylinder $\mathbb{R}^1\times\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. While the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ arises geometrically as the angular coordinates of cones, the origin of the line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is analytic and rooted in Haag duality. The usual braided (for $n=2$) or symmetric (for $n\geq 3$) monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of superselection sectors are recovered by removing a point of the sphere $\mathbb{R}^1\times(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\setminus\mathrm{pt}) \cong\mathbb{R}^n$ and using the equivalence between $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and locally constant prefactorization algebras defined on open disks in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-trivial homotopy groups of spheres induce additional algebraic structures on these $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal $C^\ast$-categories, which in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is given by a braided monoidal self-equivalence arising geometrically as a kind of `holonomy' around the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$. The locally constant prefactorization algebra structures discovered in this work generalize, under some mild geometric conditions, to other discrete spaces and thereby provide a clear link between the geometry of the localization regions and the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors.</p>

            <h2>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maarten Golterman, Yigal Shamir</p>
            <p>Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.</p>

            <p>The integration of high-energy degrees of freedom along the renormalization group (RG) flow in Poincaré-invariant theories can be captured by a monotonic c-function. For such theories, holographic monotonic c-functions have been constructed using entanglement entropy. However, in theories with broken Lorentz invariance, such constructions generally fail, reflecting both the violation of the entanglement RG monotonicity and its limitations in capturing certain properties of non-relativistic RG flows. Since many quantum many-body systems lack Lorentz invariance, it is of significant importance to identify a quantity that reflects the decrease in degrees of freedom along non-relativistic RG flows. We show that the recently introduced holographic timelike entanglement entropy naturally gives rise to a new c-function applicable to all such theories. We further demonstrate the existence of this c-function in theories with Lifshitz and hyperscaling-violating fixed points, showing that, provided the null energy conditions and thermodynamic stability are satisfied, the proposed c-function exhibits the expected monotonic behavior along the RG flow.</p>

            <p>We present a method to quantify entanglement in mixed states of highly symmetric systems. Symmetry constrains interactions between parts and predicts the degeneracies of the states. While symmetry alone produces entangled eigenstates, the thermal mixed state (density) which contains all of the eigenstate densities weighted by their Boltzmann factors is not necessarily as entangled as the eigenstates themselves because generally the mixed state can be re-expressed as a sum over densities which are less entangled. The entanglement of the mixed state is the minimum obtained by considering all such re-expressions, but there is no well-defined approach to solving this problem generally. Our method uses symmetry to explicitly construct unentangled densities, which are then optimally included in the thermal mixed state, resulting in a quantitative measure of entanglement that accounts for the reduction of entanglement arising from degenerate states. We present results for several small spin systems.</p>

As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel A. Nosov, Zhaoyu Han, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>Recent experiments reported evidence of superconductivity and re-entrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) insulator upon doping the $\nu_e = 2/3$ fractional quantum anomalous Hall states (FQAH) in twisted MoTe${}_2$, separated by narrow resistive regions. Anyons of a FQAH generally have a finite effective mass, and when described by anyon-flux composite fermions (CF), experience statistical magnetic fields with a commensurate filling. Here, we show that most of the experimental observations can be explained by invoking the effects of disorder on the Landau-Hofstadter bands of CFs. In particular, by making minimal assumptions about the anyon energetics and dispersion, we show that doping anyons drives plateau transitions of CFs into integer quantum Hall states, which physically corresponds to either to a superconductor or to a RIQAH phase. We develop a dictionary that allows us to infer the response in these phases and the critical regions from the knowledge of the response functions of the plateau transitions. In particular, this allows us to relate the superfluid stiffness of the superconductor to the polarizability of CFs. As a first step towards a quantitative understanding, we borrow results from the celebrated integer quantum Hall plateau transitions to make quantitative prediction for the critical behavior of the superfluid stiffness, longitudinal and Hall conductivity, and response to out-of-plane magnetic field, all of which agree reasonably well with the experimental observations. Our results provide strong support for anyon superconductivity being the mechanism for the observed superconductor in the vicinity of the $\nu_e = 2/3$ FQAH insulator.</p>

Typically, data analysis proceeds via the inspection of time distribution curves (TDCs), which represent the time-dependent photoemission intensity in a region of interest -- often chosen somewhat arbitrarily -- in energy-momentum space. Here, we employ $k$-means, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to systematically investigate trends in TDC line shape for quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene and for a simple analytical model. Our analysis reveals how finite energy and time resolution can affect the TDC line shape. We discuss how this can be taken into account in a quantitative analysis, and under what conditions the time-dependent photoemission intensity after laser excitation can be approximated by a simple exponential decay.</p>

While the frequencies of both modes increase with the electron density, we observe an asymmetric response with respect to the electric field in a dual-gated trilayer device. To understand the mechanism of this disparity, we develop a layer-resolved macrospin model describing the magnetic dynamics in thin, non-uniformly doped devices. Through this model we establish the doping- and electric-field-dependence of the exchange interaction, magnetic anisotropy, and magnetic moment of individual layers. Our results advance the applications of gate-tunable magnonic devices based on 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Doried Ghader, Bilal Jabakhanji</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the magnon band topology and associated topological edge states (TESs) in Neel-type ferromagnetic skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, using parameters relevant to monolayer CrI3. Employing stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations and discrete Holstein-Primakoff bosonization, we analyze the impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice structure on the magnonic spectrum, in contrast to the extensively studied triangular spin-lattice SkXs. Our analysis identifies topological features unique to the honeycomb lattice. In particular, certain characteristic magnon modes (e.g., elliptical distortion and triangular distortion modes) acquire nontrivial Chern numbers absent in triangular-based SkXs. Moreover, contrary to predictions based on triangular spin-lattice SkXs, we find that the counterclockwise (CCW)-breathing magnonic gap exhibits topological behavior only at large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI), losing its universality with decreasing DMI strength. Meanwhile, the second magnon gap consistently hosts robust TESs across the entire range of DMI and magnetic fields studied, closing at critical fields through field-induced topological phase transitions. The study further uncovers a remarkable richness in the magnon topology, identifying 65 distinct topological magnon phases generated by magnetic-field-driven skyrmion deformation. These findings underscore the profound role of lattice geometry in shaping magnon topology in non-collinear spin textures.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium transport through the Hubbard dimer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaroslav Pavlyukh, Riku Tuovinen</p>
            <p>We apply a computationally efficient approach to study the time- and energy-resolved spectral properties of a two-site Hubbard model using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. By employing the iterative generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA) within a time-linear framework, we avoid the computational cost of solving the full two-time Kadanoff-Baym equations. Spectral information is extracted by coupling the system to multiple narrow-band leads, establishing a direct analogy to photoemission experiments. Our results reveal correlation-induced shifts and broadenings of spectral features, along with a suppression of transient current oscillations. This approach provides a promising avenue for analyzing correlated electron dynamics in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We report on the discovery of superconductivity in the previously unknown compound Ta$_4$Rh$_2$C$_{1-\delta}$. Ta$_4$Rh$_2$C$_{1-\delta}$ crystallizes in the $\eta$-carbide structure type, in the cubic space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ (No.227) with a unit cell parameter of $a = $ 11.7947 Å. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and specific heat capacity measurements reveal that Ta$_4$Rh$_2$C$_{1-\delta}$ is a type-II bulk superconductor with a critical temperature of $T_{\rm c}$ = 6.4 K, and a normalized specific heat jump $\Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c}$ = 1.56. Notably, we find Ta$_4$Rh$_2$C$_{1-\delta}$ has a high upper critical field of $\mu_0 H_{\rm c2}{\rm (0)}$ = 17.4 T, which is exceeding the BCS weak coupling Pauli limit of $\mu_0 H_{\rm Pauli}$ = 11.9 T.</p>

            <p>We report the computational discovery and characterization of Dodecaphenylyne (DP), a novel carbon allotrope with a distinctive geometric arrangement. DP structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, electronic, and optical properties were evaluated using density functional theory and a machine learning interatomic potential trained explicitly for this material. The formation energy of -7.98 eV/atom indicates high thermodynamic stability, further supported by the absence of imaginary phonon modes and the preservation of structural integrity up to 1000 K in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Mechanical analysis reveals high in-plane stiffness with directional dependence: Young's modulus values of 469.09 GPa and 600.41 GPa along the x and y directions, respectively. Electronic band structure and projected density of states analyses confirm the DP semiconducting character. Calculations of carrier mobility using the deformation potential theory reveal pronounced anisotropy, with maximum values reaching up to $30.6 \times 10^4$ cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s (electrons, e) and $8.4 \times 10^4$ cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s (holes, h), much higher than the observed for other 2D materials. DP also exhibits anisotropic optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum, highlighting its potential for optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the behavior of phonons at the epitaxial interface between YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} thin film and (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 substrate using vibrational electron energy loss spectroscopy. Interfacial phonon modes with different degrees of scattering localization were identified. We find evidence that surface contributions from the surrounding environment can impose additional scattering modulation into local EELS measurements at the interface. A method to remove those contributions is then used to isolate the phonon information at the interface. This work unveils interfacial phonon modes in a high-Tc cuprate superconductor, that are not accessible with traditional phonon spectroscopy techniques, and provides a method for probing interfacial phonons in complex oxide heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Efficient hydrogen storage in solid-state materials is essential for next-generation energy systems, yet achieving a high gravimetric capacity with optimal adsorption characteristics remains a critical challenge. Although Li-decorated irida-graphene (IG) has shown promising hydrogen storage potential, its capacity is limited to $\sim$ 7wt\%, which, despite exceeding the U.S. DOE target, remains inadequate for large-scale applications. Additionally, Li clustering over extended cycles may compromise adsorption efficiency and structural stability. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the hydrogen storage potential of IG decorated with superalkali OLi$_3$ clusters, aiming to enhance the adsorption capacity and stability for advanced hydrogen storage technologies. Our findings show that the OLi$_3$ clusters exhibit a significant binding energy of -3.24 eV, which highlights its strong interaction with the IG. OLi$_3$@IG complex can host up to 12H$_2$ molecules, with optimal maximum storage capacity of 10.00 wt\%. Additionally, the release temperature (T$_R$) and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate that H$_2$ molecules can be efficiently released at operating temperatures under ambient conditions. These results highlight the potential of OLi$_3$-decorated irida-graphene as a promising candidate for reversible hydrogen storage.</p>

            <p>Quantum dot mode-locked laser-based optical frequency combs are emerging as a critical solution for achieving low-cost, high-efficiency, and large-capacity optical interconnects. The practical implementation of wavelength division multiplexing interconnects necessitates a temperature-stable OFC source with a minimum 100 GHz channel spacing to enable high-bandwidth modulation while mitigating the complexity of optical filtering and detection. By leveraging the advanced co-doping technique and a colliding pulse mode-locking scheme, here, we report a compact, ultra-wideband, highly reliable, isolator-free 100 GHz-spacing InAs/GaAs QD OFC source operating up to a record temperature of 140 °C. The comb source delivers a record 3 dB optical bandwidth of 14.312 nm, containing flat-top comb lines, each supporting 128 Gb/s PAM-4 modulation, which results in a total throughput of 3.328 Tb/s with an extremely low power consumption of 0.394 pJ/bit at 25°C. Performance remains stable at 85 °C, with negligible degradation of device critical metrics. Remarkably, accelerated aging tests under harsh conditions (85 °C with 8x threshold current injection) revealed a mean time to failure of approximately 207 years. The QD OFC source demonstrated in this work, for the first time, establishes a concrete link between fundamental research on comb sources and their practical deployment in next-generation, high-density optical interconnect systems.</p>

Most importantly, our analysis reveals a new mechanism for reducing the magnetic gap of the topological surface states based on the orbital composition of the wavefunction.</p>

            <p>The study of magnetism in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant interest, driven by fundamental investigations into low-dimensional magnetic phenomena and their potential for applications in spintronic devices. Through dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we demonstrate that Ni$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ exhibits flat-band characteristics resulting from the geometric frustration of its layered triangular lattice. These flat bands are further renormalized due to moderate electronic correlation. Our calculations reveal that the magnetic order of Ni atoms is significantly influenced by both the Coulomb interaction and Hund's coupling, indicating that the physics of Ni atoms is situated in an intermediate region between Hundness and Mottness. Additionally, our results show that Ni atoms experience significant spin fluctuations in their local moments, maintaining paramagnetism at low temperatures. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of vacancies, finding a substantial suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. The physical mechanisms uncovered by our study provide a comprehensive understanding of the novel properties exhibited by this type of material.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the role of confinement-induced resonances (CIRs) in low-dimensional ultracold atomic mixtures for the formation of weakly bound dimers. To this end, we examine the scattering properties of a binary atomic mixture confined by a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) potential. In this regime, the interspecies two-body interaction is modeled as an effective 1D zero-range pseudopotential, with a coupling strength $g_\mathrm{1D}$ derived as a function of the three-dimensional scattering length $a$. This framework enables the study of CIRs in harmonically confined systems, with particular attention to the case of mismatched transverse trapping frequencies for the two atomic species. Finally, we consider the Bose-Fermi mixture of $^{87}$Rb and $^{87}$Sr, and identify values of the experimentally accessible parameters for which CIRs can be exploited to create weakly bound molecules.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Chu, Zheng Wang, Christopher Ness, Konrad Samwer, Alessio Zaccone, Lina Hu</p>
            <p>Metallic glasses possess outstanding mechanical and physical properties, making them promising candidates for advanced structural and functional applications; however, the lack of understanding and control over their glass transition and solidification processes remains a significant barrier to practical design. The glass transition from liquid to amorphous solid has remained an open problem in physics despite many theories and recent advances in computational efforts. The question of identifying a clear and well-defined diverging length scale accompanying the glass transition has remained unanswered, as has the nature of the transition and, indeed, the presence of a transition at all, as opposed to a mere dynamical crossover. Here we answer these questions using numerical results and theoretical analysis showing that, in atomic (metallic) glass formers, the glass transition coincides with, and is caused by, a continuous rigidity percolation transition from a liquid-like to a solid-like material. The transition occurs as five-fold symmetric atomic clusters progressively aggregate, forming a system-spanning rigid network that marks the onset of mechanical stability. This percolation-driven rigidity growth is accompanied by a sharp increase in the shear modulus G', indicating the emergence of macroscopic solid-like behavior. Beyond this point, which coincides with the Maxwell isostatic point of the percolating structure, dynamical arrest or "freezing-in" prevents further evolution. The long-sought diverging length scale is thus identified as the percolation-driven growth of rigid five-fold clusters, providing a direct link between local structural motifs and macroscopic mechanical properties at the glass transition. These insights offer practical routes to rationally engineer metallic glasses with targeted mechanical stiffness, hardness, and toughness.</p>

            <p>Electronic conductivity in organic materials is well-established. Moreover, semiconductive or metallic behavior in (quasi) 0-, 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional carbon-based materials has been demonstrated and understood and is nowadays widely applied in commercial devices. Despite the large structural variety, these materials commonly have an extended $\pi$-system, formed by sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which is responsible for the conductivity. Here, we present a class of organic molecular materials that, despite the absence of an extended $\pi$-system, show a distinct direct current conductivity in quasi-1D supramolecular stacks of small organic molecules. Long-range conductivity takes place by removal of an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital, i.e. oxidation, followed by charge transfer between neighboring molecules. In thin-film devices, the resulting transport band becomes energetically accessible to charges from the contacts by interfacial dipoles stemming from a dipolar group in the molecule. Long-range order in the form of the supramolecular polymers with lengths exceeding several micrometers enhances the macroscopic conductivity but is not essential. The results presented herein show a new way to incorporate electronic functionality in organic materials and present a new class of organic conductors that lack the extended $\pi$-electron-system of conventional organic semiconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Karmakar, Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti</p>
            <p>Quasiperiodic systems are known to exhibit localization transitions in low dimensions, wherein all electronic states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant localization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic disorder strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously localized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter window. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with simple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals, the impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior remains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior in a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials following the Aubry-André-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping modulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean sequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse participation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the occurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between quasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. Our findings highlight the crucial role of underlying structural correlations in governing localization-delocalization transitions in low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, where the correlated disorder manifests in both diagonal and off-diagonal terms.</p>

A robust signature of the semiconductor-to-Dirac semimetal transition is identified in the spherically averaged Compton profile. We demonstrate how the number of electrons involved in this transition can be estimated to provide a novel descriptor for quantifying the strength of spin-orbit coupling responsible for driving the transition. The associated theoretical deviation of the Born charge of Na in Na$_3$Bi from the expected ionic charge of +1 is found to be consistent with the corresponding experimental value of about 10%.

            <p>We study the violation of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in hybrid superconducting systems consisting of one superconducting and two normal leads coupled to a central region containing localized levels, focusing on the role of quantum coherence. We first study the simplest setup yielding TUR violations, where the central region is a single-level quantum dot and only one normal lead is connected. In addition to the {\it classical} TUR, we consider an alternative formulation recently derived for coherent conductors. We find even the latter TUR is violated (although by a smaller extent) as a result of the macroscopic coherence related to the superconducting condensate. To support this conclusion, we connect the second normal lead as a dephasing probe, demonstrating that the violation is directly correlated with the superconducting coherence, as measured by the dot's pair amplitude. When the central region is a Cooper-pair splitter, crossed Andreev processes introduce nonlocal superconducting correlations that further enhance the quantum-TUR violation.</p>

            <p>Charge density waves (CDWs) involve coupled amplitude and phase degrees of freedom, but direct access to local amplitude correlations remains experimentally challenging. Here, we report cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) measurements of CDW ordering in 2H-NbSe2, enabled by liquid helium-based cooling down to 20 K. By mapping the spatial distribution of CDW superlattice intensities at nanometer-scale resolution and analyzing their autocorrelations, we extract the temperature-dependent correlation length associated with the local amplitude of the CDW order parameter, independent of global phase coherence. Our results reveal that weak short-range amplitude correlations persist above the transition temperature, and grow significantly upon cooling, reaching approximately 150 nm at 20 K.

            <p>Optically excited quantum materials exhibit nonequilibrium states with remarkable emergent properties, but these phenomena are usually transient, decaying on picosecond timescales and limiting practical applications. Advancing the design and control of nonequilibrium phases requires the development of targeted strategies to achieve long-lived, metastable phases. Here, we report the discovery of symmetry-protected electronic metastability in the model cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$. Using femtosecond resonant x-ray scattering and spectroscopy, we show that this metastability is driven by a transfer of holes from chain-like charge reservoirs into the ladders. This ultrafast charge redistribution arises from the optical dressing and activation of a hopping pathway that is forbidden by symmetry at equilibrium. Relaxation back to the ground state is hence suppressed after the pump coherence dissipates. Our findings highlight how dressing materials with electromagnetic fields can dynamically activate terms in the electronic Hamiltonian, and provide a rational design strategy for nonequilibrium phases of matter.</p>

            <p>Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.</p>

            <p>Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The models are trained on 32 to 45 samples, using geometric inputs in the branch network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging. These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.</p>

However, most thermometric studies rely on the analysis of luminescence decay profiles, a method that significantly hinders, if not entirely precludes, real-time thermal imaging. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on the luminescence intensity ratio integrated over two temporal gates. Tests conducted on two representative phosphors, Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+, demonstrate that the proposed method not only enables thermal imaging but also achieves substantially higher relative sensitivity, reaching SR=17.1 % K-1 for Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and SR=9.4 % K-1 for Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+, compared to the conventional lifetime-based approach (SR=4.2 % K-1 for Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and SR=1.2 % K-1 for Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+). Furthermore, careful selection of gate lengths allows optimization of the thermometric performance of the proposed luminescent thermometers. This approach enables expansion of the thermal operating range at the cost of relative sensitivity, providing versatility to adapt the thermometer for specific applications.</p>

            <h2>DistMLIP: A Distributed Inference Platform for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin Han, Bowen Deng, Amir Barati Farimani, Gerbrand Ceder</p>
            <p>Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications. In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional space-partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that existing foundational potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.</p>

            <h2>Learning Circuits with Infinite Tensor Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joe Gibbs, Lukasz Cincio</p>
            <p>Hamiltonian simulation on quantum computers is strongly constrained by gate counts, motivating techniques to reduce circuit depths. While tensor networks are natural competitors to quantum computers, we instead leverage them to support circuit design, with datasets of tensor networks enabling a unitary synthesis inspired by quantum machine learning. For a target simulation in the thermodynamic limit, translation invariance is exploited to significantly reduce the optimization complexity, avoiding a scaling with system size. Our approach finds circuits to efficiently prepare ground states, and perform time evolution on both infinite and finite systems with substantially lower gate depths than conventional Trotterized methods. In addition to reducing CNOT depths, we motivate similar utility for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, with a demonstrated $5.2\times$ reduction in $T$-count to realize $e^{-iHt}$. The key output of our approach is the optimized unit-cell of a translation invariant circuit. This provides an advantage for Hamiltonian simulation of finite, yet arbitrarily large, systems on real quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatrice Magni, Xhek Turkeshi</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum correlation beyond entanglement: Holographic discord and multipartite generalizations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takato Mori</p>
            <p>While entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum theory and holography, quantum correlations arising from superposition, such as quantum discord, offer a broader perspective that has remained largely unexplored in holography. We construct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both holographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement, revealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and non-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically non-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence and persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by the holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free boundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even outside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite generalizations of discord, including a holography-inspired one based on multi-entropy. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum correlations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and offer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures.</p>

            <p>In vivo skin exhibits viscoelastic, hyper-elastic and non-linear characteristics. It is under a constant non-equibiaxial tension in its natural configuration and is reinforced with oriented collagen fibers, giving rise to anisotropic behaviour. Understanding the complex mechanical behaviour of skin has relevance across many sectors including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and surgery. However, there is a dearth of quality data characterizing human skin anisotropy in vivo. The available data is usually confined to limited population groups and/or limited angular resolution. Here, we use elastic waves travelling through the skin to obtain measurements from 78 volunteers from 3 to 93 years old. Using a Bayesian framework, we analyse the effect that age, gender and level of skin tension have on the skin anisotropy and stiffness. First, we propose a new measurement of anisotropy based on the eccentricity of angular data and conclude that it is a more robust measurement compared to the classic ``anisotropic ratio". We then find that in vivo skin anisotropy increases logarithmically with age, while the skin stiffness increases linearly along the direction of Langer Lines. We also conclude that gender does not significantly affect the skin anisotropy level, but does affect the overall stiffness, with males having stiffer skin on average. Finally, we find that skin tension significantly affects both the anisotropy and stiffness measurements, indicating that elastic wave measurements have promising applications in determining in vivo skin tension. In contrast to earlier studies, these results represent a comprehensive assessment of the variation of skin anisotropy with age and gender using a sizeable dataset and robust modern statistical analysis. This data has implications for the planning of surgical procedures and the adoption of universal cosmetic surgery practices for young or elderly patients.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thiago Ganascini, Wendel Lopes da Silva, Daniel Valente</p>
            <p>Finding principles of nonequilibrium self-organization in dissipative quantum systems is an open problem. One example is the notion of quantum dissipative adaptation (QDA), that relates the transition probability between the ground states of a quantum system to the nonequilibrium work absorbed during the transition. However, QDA has been originally derived with three-level systems in lambda ({\Lambda}) configuration. Here, we consider a model consisting of a two-site system driven by single-photon pulses. We find that the absorbed work is generally related to the sum of {\Lambda}-type transition probabilities, instead of the direct transition probability between the two ground states. Although this is equivalent to standard QDA in most scenarios, we find an exception whereby optimal self-organization does not maximize work consumption. We show how quantum coherence leaves this kind of imprint in the energetics of self-organization in the present model.</p>

            <p>The one-dimensional Fröhlich model describing the motion of a single electron interacting with optical phonons is a paradigmatic model of quantum many-body physics. We predict the existence of an arbitrarily large number of bound excited states in the strong coupling limit and calculate their excitation energies. Numerical simulations of a discretized model demonstrate the complete amelioration of the projector Monte Carlo sign problem by walker annihilation in an infinite Hilbert space. They reveal the threshold for the occurrence of the first bound excited states at a value of $\alpha \approx 1.73$ for the dimensionless coupling constant. This puts the threshold into the regime of intermediate interaction strength. We calculate the spectral weight and the number density of the dressing cloud in the discretized model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iñigo Liberal, Alejandro Manjavacas</p>
            <p>The interaction of light with rotating bodies has been historically limited to rotation frequencies much smaller than optical frequencies. Here, we investigate synthetic crystal rotations, i.e., spatiotemporal modulations mimicking the rotation of an anisotropic crystal, which grant access to large rotation frequencies. Spatiotemporal modulations change the fundamental symmetries of the electromagnetic field, breaking temporal and rotation symmetries, but preserving a spatiotemporal rotation symmetry that enforces the conservation of a combination of energy and spin angular momentum (SAM). The scattering of optical pulses by synthetically rotating crystals results in spatiotemporal light with intra-pulse SAM changes. The frequency-domain response reveals sidebands with frequency/SAM locking, and negative frequency sideband transitions for large enough rotation frequencies. Our results highlight the qualitatively different light-matter interaction regimes accessed by synthetic rotations.</p>

            <p>The strong coupling between light and matter gives rise to polaritons. Further coupling polaritons to phonons leads to the formation of hybrid polaromechanical systems. Recent experiments have achieved the strong coupling between polaritons and phonons in two different configurations, namely, the magnon-photon-phonon and exciton-photon-phonon systems, which makes it possible to prepare and control mechanical states via manipulating the polaritons. Here, we present a polaromechanical cooling theory and show how multiple mechanical modes can be simultaneously cooled by using polaritons with a single drive field. This is achieved by exploiting the great tunability of the polariton frequencies. Specifically, $N$ polaritons can be tuned to resonantly enhance the anti-Stokes scatterings associated with $N$ mechanical modes, leading to the cooling of all the mechanical modes at once. We explicitly show how such polaromechanical cooling can simultaneously cool two mechanical modes, and then discuss how to apply it to cool multiple mechanical modes and to various polaromechanical systems, such as magnon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaromechanical systems.</p>

            <p>Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for the development of quantum repeaters and resource-efficient quantum processors. We report the experimental realization of a novel architecture of superconducting random access quantum memory with cycling storage time, achieved through pulsed control of an RF-SQUID coupling element. The device demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and achieves 57.5\% fidelity with preservation of the input pulse shape during the first retrieval interval for near-single-photon level excitations, with subsequent exponential decay characterized by a time constant of 11.44 $\mu s$. This performance represents a several-fold improvement over previously reported implementations. Crucially, we establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching imperfections. These results highlight the potential of proposed architecture for quantum memory applications while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</p>

            <p>We study the recovery of multiple high-dimensional signals from two noisy, correlated modalities: a spiked matrix and a spiked tensor sharing a common low-rank structure. This setting generalizes classical spiked matrix and tensor models, unveiling intricate interactions between inference channels and surprising algorithmic behaviors. Notably, while the spiked tensor model is typically intractable at low signal-to-noise ratios, its correlation with the matrix enables efficient recovery via Bayesian Approximate Message Passing, inducing staircase-like phase transitions reminiscent of neural network phenomena. In contrast, empirical risk minimization for joint learning fails: the tensor component obstructs effective matrix recovery, and joint optimization significantly degrades performance, highlighting the limitations of naive multi-modal learning. We show that a simple Sequential Curriculum Learning strategy-first recovering the matrix, then leveraging it to guide tensor recovery-resolves this bottleneck and achieves optimal weak recovery thresholds. This strategy, implementable with spectral methods, emphasizes the critical role of structural correlation and learning order in multi-modal high-dimensional inference.</p>

            <p>A phase-field model is developed to simulate intergranular corrosion of ferritic/martensitic steels exposed to liquid lithium. The chromium concentration of the material is used to track the mass transport within the metal and liquid (corrosive) phase. The framework naturally captures intergranular corrosion by enhancing the diffusion of chromium along grain boundaries relative to the grain bulk with no special treatment for the corrosion front evolution. The formulation applies to arbitrary 2D and 3D polycrystalline geometries. The framework reproduces experimental measurements of weight loss and corrosion depth for a 9 wt\% Cr ferritic/martensitic steel exposed to static lithium at 600 $^\circ$C. A sensitivity analysis, varying near-surface grain density, grain size, and chromium depletion thickness, highlights the microstructural influence in the corrosion process. Moreover, the significance of saturation is considered and evaluated. Simulation results show that near-surface grain density is a deciding factor, whereas grain size dictates the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion.</p>

            <p>The electro-hydrodynamics near conducting walls is revisited. Attention is focused on the impact of an explicit diffuse Stern layer, which permittivity and viscosity differ from the bulk values, on the velocity of an electro-osmotic plug flow. To solve this problem we propose an approach of mapping the flow in the Stern layer to the surface dividing the Stern and diffuse layer, where an effective electro-hydrodynamic slip boundary condition is imposed. The latter implies that an effective surface charge is responding to the applied field and characterized by a mobility parameter $\mu \geq 1$. We derive analytic equations for $\mu$ and demonstrate that it is determined only by electrostatic properties of the electric double layer. These equations are then used to calculate electrokinetic (zeta) potentials of surfaces. We show that the zeta potential generally exceeds the surface one, which implies an amplification of the electro-osmotic flow. This effect is most pronounced if the hydrodynamic slip length is large and/or in concentrated solutions.</p>

We compare Variational Perturbation Theory (VPT) to ordinary many-body perturbation theory and the inversion method, all to second order in their respective expansions, and verify issues with Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields. VPT outperforms the other approaches at this level over a wide range of densities. The next steps to extend this approach toward nuclei are outlined.</p>

            <p>We have developed an effective thermodynamic model for a black hole's interior composed of scalar quasiparticles. The proposed interior consists of a core and a crust; the properties of both depend on the kinetics of the quasiparticles. In the core, the quasiparticles possess zero classical kinetic energy; the total potential energy $U(N)$ of the core depends only on the number $N$ of quasiparticles inside it. The thermodynamic description of this state of matter requires the introduction of an inverse temperature $\beta$ inversely proportional to $U(N)$ that supplants the standard temperature in every thermodynamic relation inside the core, driving both the energy density and the pressure negative. The different states of the core, correspondingly, can be parametrized by an additional parameter, which is a mean occupation number $\eta$ of the quasiparticles in the core. Concerning the crust, there are quasiparticles in it that remain trapped by the gravitational potential at finite temperature. The no-escape condition for the quasiparticles in the crust is imposed through a truncation of the phase-space integrals, yielding a direct and analytical coupling between thermodynamics and gravity. The resulting framework unifies core and crust within a single quasiparticle description, highlights the role of negative energy and pressure in black hole interiors, and provides testable predictions for any semiclassical theory that aims to resolve the singularity problem.</p>

As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p>The many-body physics at quantum phase transitions shows a subtle interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations, emerging in the low-temperature limit. In this review, we first give a pedagogical introduction to the equilibrium behavior of systems in that context, whose scaling framework is essentially developed by exploiting the quantum-to-classical mapping and the renormalization-group theory of critical phenomena at continuous phase transitions. Then we specialize to protocols entailing the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, such as instantaneous quenches and slow passages across quantum transitions. These are mostly discussed within dynamic scaling frameworks, obtained by appropriately extending the equilibrium scaling laws. We review phenomena at first-order quantum transitions as well, whose peculiar scaling behaviors are characterized by an extreme sensitivity to the boundary conditions, giving rise to exponentials or power laws for the same bulk system. In the last part, we cover aspects related to the effects of dissipative interactions with an environment, through suitable generalizations of the dynamic scaling at quantum transitions. The presentation is limited to issues related to, and controlled by, the quantum transition developed by closed many-body systems, treating the dissipation as a perturbation of the critical regimes, as for the temperature at the zero-temperature quantum transition. We focus on the physical conditions giving rise to a nontrivial interplay between critical modes and various dissipative mechanisms, generally realized when the involved mechanism excites only the low-energy modes of the quantum transitions.</p>

We achieve high accuracy in a proof-of-concept classification task using four magnetic topological memristors. Furthermore, our algorithm-level and circuit-level simulations of large-scale neural networks demonstrate software-level accuracy and lower energy consumption for image recognition and quantum state preparation compared with existing magnetic memristor and CMOS technologies.

            <p>Electronic band structure is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics and materials science. Conventional methods like Wannier interpolation (WI), which are commonly used to interpolate band structures onto dense k-point grids, often encounter difficulties with complex systems, such as those involving entangled bands or topological obstructions. We introduce the Hamiltonian transformation (HT) method, a novel framework that enhances interpolation accuracy by localizing the Hamiltonian. Using a pre-optimized transformation, HT produces a far more localized Hamiltonian than WI-SCDM (where Wannier functions are generated via the selected columns of the density matrix projection), achieving up to two orders of magnitude greater accuracy for entangled bands. Although HT utilizes a slightly larger, nonlocal numerical basis set, its construction is rapid and requires no optimization, resulting in significant computational speedups. These features make HT a more precise, efficient, and robust alternative to WI-SCDM for band structure interpolation, as verified by high-throughput calculations.</p>

Strain engineering on graphene has been achieved via random nanobubbles or artificial nanostructures on the substrate, but the highly localized and non-uniform pseudomagnetic fields can make spectroscopic probes of electronic structure difficult. Heterostructure engineering offers an alternative approach: By stacking graphene on top of another van der Waals material with large lattice mismatch at a desired twist angle, it is possible to generate large strain-induced pseudo magnetic fields uniformly over the entire heterostructure. Here, we report using nano-angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (nano-ARPES) to probe the electronic bandstructure of a graphene/black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP). By directly measuring the iso-energy contours of graphene and black phosphorus we determine a twist angle of 20-degrees in our heterostructure. High-resolution nano-ARPES of the graphene bands near the Fermi level reveals the emergence of flat bands located within the Dirac cone. The spacing of the flat bands is consistent with Landau level formation in graphene, and corresponds to a pseudo-field of 11.36 T. Our work provides a new way to study quantum Hall phases induced by strain in 2D materials and heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Poisson-Nernst-Planck charging dynamics of an electric double layer capacitor: symmetric and asymmetric binary electrolytes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Palaia, Adelchi J. Asta, Megh Dutta, Patrick B. Warren, Benjamin Rotenberg, Emmanuel Trizac</p>
            <p>A parallel plate capacitor containing an electrolytic solution is the simplest model of a supercapacitor, or electric double layer capacitor. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for such a system, describing the mean-field charging dynamics of the capacitor, when a constant potential difference is abruptly applied to its plates. Working at constant total number of ions, we focus on the physical processes involved in the relaxation and, whenever possible, give its functional shape and exact time constants. We first review and study the case of a symmetric binary electrolyte, where we assume the two ionic species to have the same charges and diffusivities. We then relax these assumptions and present results for a generic strong (i.e. fully dissociated) binary electrolyte. At low electrolyte concentration, the relaxation is simple to understand, as the dynamics of positive and negative ions appear decoupled. At higher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear regime (low voltages), relaxation is multi-exponential, it starts by the build-up of the equilibrium charge profile and continues with neutral mass diffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the Nernst-Hartley diffusion coefficients. In the purely nonlinear regime (intermediate voltages), the initial relaxation is slowed down exponentially due to increased capacitance, while bulk effects become more and more evident. In the fully nonlinear regime (high voltages), the dynamics of charge and mass are completely entangled and, asymptotically, the relaxation is linear in time. We finally discuss non-ideal behavior in real capacitors and provide conditions for which mean-field is expected to hold.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic scales and mechanism of quantum phase transitions in two-dimensional superconducting systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Rogachev, Samuel Feldman, Kevin Davenport</p>
            <p>The superconducting ground state in many two-dimensional materials can be created or destroyed through quantum phase transitions (QPTs) controlled by non-thermal parameters such as carrier density or magnetic field. While various mechanisms for these QPTs have been proposed, it remains unclear which, if any, are applicable to a specific two-dimensional superconducting system. Here, we find that a pair-breaking mechanism which suppresses the Cooper pair density gives a unifying description of magnetic-field-driven QPTs in amorphous MoGe, Pb and TaN films, and the high-temperature superconductor La$_{1.92}$Sr$_{0.08}$CuO$_{4}$. This transition occurs within the superconducting subsystem and is masked by the dominant non-critical contribution of normal electrons. The discovery was enabled by the development of a QPT model that goes beyond the conventional determination of the critical exponents and incorporates into the analysis a microscopic length scale characterizing the transitions. We found that in the materials studied, and MoGe nanowires, this scale corresponds to the size of a Cooper pair. The model has also been successfully applied to QPTs in Josephson junction arrays and various non-superconducting materials. The observation that microscopic scales are encoded in the scaled experimental data of QPTs likely extends beyond equilibrium condensed matter physics and may reveal underlying principles of critical phenomena in a wide variety of systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Bandur, Abigail Lee, Jakob Nachtigal, Stefan Tsankov, Juergen Haase</p>
            <p>Cuprates currently hold the record for the highest temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure, but the microscopic understanding of these materials remains elusive. Here we utilize nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data of planar oxygen and copper from essentially all hole-doped cuprates to provide a universal phenomenology relating the NMR spin shifts, which measure the electronic spin polarization at a given nucleus, with the superconducting dome and maximum critical temperature. We demonstrate that there are two separate contributions to the spin shift at planar copper, only one of which is seen at oxygen, and associate them with two different carrier types. Upon disentangling these two components, their relative size is shown to determine not only the doping dependence of the superconducting dome, but also the variation in maximum superconducting critical temperature, $T_\mathrm{c}$, between different families. One of these components is independent of family and resides in the hybridized planar orbitals. The second component, in contrast, has a more three-dimensional character and encodes the differences between the families. It is thus related to the charge transfer gap and planar hole sharing. Our findings offer a key, universal insight which should prove useful in the continuing development of a comprehensive theory of the cuprates, as well as an indication of how it may be possible to engineer materials with higher critical temperatures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sadjad Arzash, Indrajit Tah, Andrea J. Liu, M. Lisa Manning</p>
            <p>How do cells tune emergent properties at the scale of tissues? One class of such emergent behaviors are rigidity transitions, in which a tissue changes from a solid-like to a fluid-like state or vice versa. Here, we introduce a new way for a tissue described by a vertex model to tune its rigidity, by using ``tunable degrees of freedom." We use the vertex model elastic energy as a cost function and the cell stiffnesses, target shapes, and target areas as different sets of degrees of freedom describing cell-cell interactions that can be tuned to minimize the cost function. We show that the rigidity transition is unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as tunable degrees of freedom. When preferred shapes or areas are treated as tunable degrees of freedom, however, induced spatial correlations in target cell shapes or areas shift the rigidity transition. These observations suggest that tissues can coordinate changes in cell-scale properties, treated here as tunable degrees of freedom, to achieve desired tissue-scale behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Active nematic liquid crystals under a quenched random field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yutaka Kinoshita, Nariya Uchida</p>
            <p>Coupling between flow and orientation is a central issue in understanding the collective dynamics of active biofilaments and cells. Active stresses generated by motor activity destroy (quasi-)long-range orientational order and induce chaotic flows with many vortices. In cellular and subcellular environment, alignment is also hindered by heterogeneous filamentous structures in extracellular matrix and various intracellular organelles. Here we address the effects of a quenched random field on the flow patterns and orientational order in two-dimensional active nematic liquid crystals. We find that the director dynamics becomes frozen above a critical disorder strength. For sufficiently strong randomness, the orientational correlation function decays exponentially with distance, reproducing the behavior of passive random-field nematics. In contrast, the flow velocity decreases only gradually with increasing disorder, and exhibits a logarithmic spatial correlation under strong randomness. We identify the threshold between the activity- and disorder-dominated regimes and examine its dependence on the activity parameter.</p>

            <h2>Universal limiting behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems with conservation laws</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua F. Robinson, Thomas Machon, Thomas Speck</p>
            <p>Making sense of complex inhomogeneous systems composed of many interacting species is a grand challenge that pervades basically all natural sciences. Phase separation and pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems have been largely studied as two separate paradigms. Here we show that in reaction-diffusion systems composed of many species, the presence of a conservation law constrains the evolution of the conserved quantity to be governed by a Cahn-Hilliard-like equation. This establishes a direct link with the paradigm of coexistence and recent "active" field theories. Hence, even for complex many-species systems a dramatically simplified but accurate description emerges over coarse spatio-temporal scales. Using the nullcline (the line of homogeneous steady states) as the central motif, we develop a geometrical framework which endows chemical space with a basis and suitable coordinates. This framework allows us to capture and understand the effect of eliminating fast non-conserved degrees of freedom, and to explicitly construct coefficients of the coarse field theory. We expect that the theory we develop here will be particularly relevant to advance our understanding of biomolecular condensates.</p>

            <p>Square lattice Hubbard models with tunable hopping ratio $t'/t$ are highly promising for realizing a variety of quantum phases and for shedding light on key puzzles in correlated quantum materials, including higher-temperature superconductivity. We show that twisted square lattice homo-bilayers generically offer such tunability when the flat bands originate from the corner of the Brillouin zone. We reveal an emergent symmetry at low twist-angles, absent in single layers, that necessitates the vanishing of nearest neighbor hopping ($t=0$). This symmetry can be lifted by an inter-layer displacement field or by an in-plane magnetic field, introducing tunable $t$ and anisotropy, allowing access to a wide range of $t'/t$ ratios for correlated electrons on a moiré square lattice.</p>

            <h2>Integrative Mobility Model For Grain-Boundary-Limited Transport In Thermoelectric Compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gbadebo Taofeek Yusuf, Sukhwinder Singh, Alexandros Askounis, Zlatka Stoeva, Fideline Tchuenbou-Magaia</p>
            <p>Grain-boundary-limited charge transport remains a key bottleneck in polycrystalline thermoelectric materials, where reduced carrier mobility degrades electrical conductivity and suppresses the power factor. Here we present a semi-empirical mobility model that integrates three dominant grain-boundary mechanisms: (i) weighted mobility linked to carrier effective mass and concentration, (ii) thermionic emission across grain-boundary barriers, and (iii) geometric suppression arising from a finite mean free path ($\ell$). The model is validated against a diverse set of polycrystalline thermoelectric materials -- including Bi$_2$Te$_3$, PbTe, Mg$_2$Si, and SnSe -- showing excellent agreement with experiment ($R^2 = 0.93$--0.99) and yielding physically consistent parameters: $0 \lesssim \Phi_{\mathrm{GB}} \lesssim 0.15$ eV and $\ell \approx 15$--60 nm. The model captures the non-monotonic mobility trends produced by the interplay between barrier activation and phonon scattering. We further apply the model to Al-doped ZnO, revealing that combined grain-boundary passivation (reducing $\Phi_{\mathrm{GB}}$ from 0.15 eV to 0.05 eV) and moderate grain growth (increasing $\ell$ from 5 nm to 25 nm) can raise the power factor by $\sim 6\times$ (from $\sim 4$ to $\sim 26$ mW\,m$^{-1}$\,K$^{-2}$) and the electronic quality factor $B$ by nearly $7\times$ (from $\sim 0.15$ to $>1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^2$\,V$^{-1}$\,s$^{-1}$\,kg$^{3/2}$), approaching values achieved in leading chalcogenide thermoelectrics. The model therefore provides a transparent and practical framework for grain-boundary engineering in oxide-based thermoelectrics.</p>

            <h2>Holographic nature of critical quantum states of proteins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eszter Papp, Gabor Vattay</p>
            <p>The Anderson metal-insulator transition is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics, describing the transition from a conducting (metallic) to a non-conducting (insulating) state driven by disorder in a material. At the critical point of the Anderson transition, wave functions exhibit multifractal behavior, and energy levels display a universal distribution, indicating non-trivial correlations in the eigenstates. Recent studies have shown that proteins, traditionally considered insulators, exhibit much higher conductivity than previously assumed. In this paper, we investigate several proteins known for their efficient electron transport properties. We compare their energy level statistics, eigenfunction correlation, and electron return probability to those expected in metallic, insulating, or critical states. Remarkably, these proteins exhibit properties of critically disordered metals in their natural state without any parameter adjustment. Their composition and geometry are self-organized into the critical state of the Anderson transition, and their fractal properties are universal and unique among critical systems. Our findings suggest that proteins' wave functions may fulfill ``holographic'' area laws, since their correlation fractal dimension is \(d_2\approx 2\).</p>

            <h2>Fractionalization as an alternate to charge ordering in electronic insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seth Musser, Meng Cheng, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>Incompressible insulating phases of electronic systems at partial filling of a lattice are often associated with charge ordering that breaks lattice symmetry. The resulting phases have an enlarged unit cell with an effective integer filling. Here we explore the possibility of insulating states - which we dub "Quantum Charge Liquids" (QCL) - at partial lattice filling that preserve lattice translation symmetry. Such QCL phases must necessarily either have gapped fractionally charged excitations and associated topological order or have gapless neutral excitations. We establish some general constraints on gapped fermionic QCL phases that restrict the nature of their topological order. We prove a number of results on the minimal topological order that is consistent with the lattice filling. In particular we show that at rational fillings $\nu = p/q$ with $q$ an even integer the minimal ground state degeneracy on a torus of the fermionic QCL is $4q^2$, 4 times larger than that of the bosonic QCL at the same filling. We comment on models and physical systems which may host fermionic QCL phases and discuss the phenomenology of these phases.</p>

            <h2>Time-cost-error trade-off relation in thermodynamics: The third law and beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tan Van Vu, Keiji Saito</p>
            <p>Elucidating fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In the context of cooling, the unattainability principle of the third law of thermodynamics asserts that infinite ``resources'' are needed to reach absolute zero. However, the precise identification of relevant resources and how they jointly constrain achievable error remains unclear within the framework of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics. In this work, we introduce the concept of {\it separated states}, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states, and formulate the corresponding thermokinetic cost and error, thereby establishing a unifying framework for a broad class of thermodynamic operations. We then uncover a three-way trade-off relation between {\it time}, {\it cost}, and {\it error} for thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as $\tau{C}\varepsilon_{\tau}\ge 1-\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranay Gorantla, Tzu-Chen Huang</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze a deformation of the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory that preserves the non-invertible Wegner duality symmetry at the self-dual point. We identify a frustration-free point along this deformation where there are nine exactly degenerate ground states (on a periodic cubic lattice) even at finite volume. One of these ground states is a trivial product state and the rest are the topologically-ordered ground states of the 3+1d toric code. We also prove that the frustration-free point is gapped in the thermodynamic limit. Our model, therefore, realizes a gapped phase with spontaneously broken Wegner duality symmetry. Furthermore, by imposing the Gauss law constraints energetically, all the above features can be realized on a tensor product Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss a generalization of this deformation to the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_N$ gauge theory and conjecture the possible phase diagram.</p>

            <p>Symmetry protected topology has been studied extensively in the past twenty years, but the topology protected by spin symmetry has just begun to be studied. In this work, based on spin symmetry analysis, we propose that a class of Weyl nodal line semimetals is protected by the spin symmetry. Then, by the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ are node-network semimetals protected by the spin symmetry. Moreover, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ have nodal rings protected by the mirror symmetry and Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic spin symmetry. Furthermore, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ transform node-network semimetal phase into Weyl semimetal phase when considering spin-orbit coupling. Therefore, our work not only enriches the topological phases protected by spin symmetry, but also provides an excellent material platform to investigate the exotic physical properties of multiple altermagnetic topological semimetal phases in experiment.</p>

            <p>The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (HS) exhibit twist-angle ($\theta$) dependent interlayer charge transfer, driven by moiré potential that tunes the electronic band structure with varying $\theta$. Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Nataf</p>
            <p>We have developed an efficient method for performing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard chain with open boundary conditions, fully leveraging the SU(N) symmetry of the problem. This method extends a previously developed approach for the SU(N) Heisenberg model and relies on the systematic use of the semi-standard Young tableaux (SSYT) basis in a DMRG algorithm `a la White. Specifically, the method aligns the site-by-site growth process of the infinite-size part of the DMRG, in its original formulation, with the site-by-site construction of the SSYT (or Gelfand-like) basis, based on the chain of unitary subgroups $U(1)\subset U(2) \subset U(3) \subset U(4)\cdots $. We give special emphasis to the calculation of the symmetry-resolved reduced matrix elements of the hopping terms between the left and the right block, which makes direct use of the basis of SSYT and of the Gelfand-Tsetlin coefficients, offering a computational advantage in scaling with N compared to alternative methods that rely on summing over Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Focusing on the model with homogeneous hopping between nearest neighbors, we have calculated the ground state energy as a function of U, i.e the atom-atom interaction amplitude, up to N=6 for filling 1/N (one particle per site in average), and for one atom (resp. hole) away from filling 1/N, alllowing us to compute the charge gaps, and to estimate in the thermodynamical limit, the critical value $U_c$, separating the Mott insulator from the metallic phase. Central charges c are extracted from the entanglement entropy using the Calabrese-Cardy formula, and are consistent with the theoretical predictions: c=N-1, expected from the $SU(N)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten CFTs in the spin sector for the Mott phase, and c=N in the metallic phase, reflecting the presence of one additional (charge) gapless critical mode.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Nataf</p>
            <p>We show that the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on two sites, where N is the number of flavors of each fermion, corresponds to an exactly solvable two-level many-boson model that Richardson [J. Math. Phys. 9, 1327 (1968)] analytically solved long ago. We express the Bethe ansatz solutions as a function of the physical parameters of the SU(N) FHM, and recast its eigenvalues and eigenstates in terms of the Richardson pair energies and creation operators. In this context, the connection with the well-studied Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, known as equivalent to the Richardson model, is established and serves as a guideline to the prediction of some N-body physics phenomena in the two-site SU(N) FHM with N particles. In particular, the LMG second-order quantum phase transition (QPT) is shown to occur in the SU(N) FHM for an attractive density-density interaction U equal to U_c=-1/(2N), in units of the (absolute value of the) tunneling amplitude between the two sites. We show the finite-size energies, the gap, and the kinetic energy, which all reveal the transition, as a function of U for values of N from N = 3 to N = 36, suggesting that the QPT could be experimentally achieved with current technologies involving SU(N) ultracold atoms or molecules. Finally, we show the entanglement entropy of the first site with respect to the second, and it scales like N at the transition, in contrast with several two-mode models.</p>

            <p>Assembled monolayers of colloidal particles are crucial for various applications, including opto-electronics, surface engineering, as well as light harvesting, and catalysis. A common approach for self-assembly is the drying of a colloidal suspension film on a solid substrate using technologies such as printing and coating. However, this approach often presents challenges such as low surface coverage, stacking faults, and the formation of multiple layers. We numerically investigate the influence of substrate and particle wettability on the deposited pattern. Higher substrate wettability results in a monolayer with a hexagonal arrangement of deposited particles on the substrate. Conversely, lower substrate wettability leads to droplet formation after the film ruptures, leading to the formation of particle clusters. Furthermore, we reveal that higher particle wettability can mitigate the impact of the substrate wettability and facilitate the formation of highly ordered monolayers. We propose theoretical models predicting the surface coverage fraction dependent on particle volume fraction, initial film thickness, particle radius, as well as substrate and particle wettability, and validate these models with simulations. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the deposition process in the creation of assembled monolayers of colloidal particles.</p>

            <p>The 2d ferromagnetic Ising model was solved by Onsager on the square lattice in 1944, and an explicit expression of the free energy density $f$ is presently available for some other planar lattices. But an exact derivation of the critical temperature $T_c$ only requires a partial derivation of $f$. It has been performed on many lattices, including the 11 Archimedean lattices. In this article, we give general expressions of the free energy, energy, entropy and specific heat for planar lattices with a single type of non-crossing links. It is known that the specific heat exhibits a logarithmic singularity at $T_c$: $c_V(T)\sim -A\ln|1-T_c/T|$, in all the ferromagnetic and some antiferromagnetic cases. While the non-universal weight $A$ of the leading term has often been evaluated, this is not the case for the sub-leading order term $B$ such that $c_V(T)+A\ln|1-T_c/T|\sim B$, despite its strong impact on the $c_V(T)$ values in the vicinity of $T_c$, particularly important in experimental measurements. Explicit values of $T_c$, $A$, $B$ and other thermodynamic quantities are given for the Archimedean lattices and their duals for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions.</p>

            <h2>Uniaxial Ordering by Self-Assembly of Isotropic Octahedral Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuya Saito</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that isotropic octahedral (sixfold branched) junctions with three diagonal endpoint pairs of different colors almost inevitably form a macroscopic assembly of uniaxial order, exhibiting the perfect order of a single color. Monte Carlo simulations of the antiferromagnetic three-state Potts model on the tripartite reo net, consisting of corner-sharing regular octahedrons, confirm this counterintuitive prediction, while showcasing switching self-assembly upon an ordering phase transition. The possible inequivalence of three directions, i.e., more symmetry breaking than uniaxiality, is found and discussed for the ordered phase of this model at finite temperatures. Some additional analyses of the model are provided, including the possibility of a metastable isotropic order, which aligns better with intuition.</p>

            <h2>The Free-Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lars Kürten, Antoine Castagnède, Frank Smallenburg, C. Patrick Royall</p>
            <p>Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on its origins, due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy. Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of pre-critical nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been successfully compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Westhoff, Sebastian Paeckel, Mattia Moroder</p>
            <p>We present an efficient method for dissipatively preparing a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) directly on a lattice, avoiding the need for a two-staged preparation procedure currently used in ultracold-atom platforms. Our protocol is based on driving the lattice-subsystem into a non-equilibrium steady state, which we show to exhibit a lattice analog of a true BEC, where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. Furthermore, exploiting a symmetry-based Mpemba effect, we analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of a dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Recent experimental advances have uncovered fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) systems, posing significant theoretical challenges in understanding the interaction effects and correlated topological phases. Here, we construct a realistic moiré lattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich array of interaction- and filling-dependent phases, including the FCI, Chern insulator, and generalized Wigner crystal, etc., explaining recent experimental observations. Moreover, we reveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional moiré unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental exploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a single-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of fractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations determine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and ferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the charge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal activation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations. Overall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical tensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical framework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related systems.</p>

The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. They exhibit completely flat bands at specific values of model parameters indicated by lines in the phase diagrams. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. They reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires with strong wire-wire coupling away from the gapless regions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mutian Shen, Gerardo Ortiz, Zhiqiao Dong, Martin Weigel, Zohar Nussinov</p>
            <p>Limited resources motivate decomposing large-scale problems into smaller, "local" subsystems and stitching together the so-found solutions. We explore the physics underlying this approach and discuss the concept of "local hardness", i.e., complexity from the local solver perspective, in determining the ground states of both P- and NP-hard spin-glasses and related systems. Depending on the model considered, we observe varying scaling behaviors in how errors associated with local predictions decay as a function of the size of the solved subsystem. These errors stem from global critical threshold instabilities, characterized by gapless, avalanche-like excitations that follow scale-invariant size distributions. Away from criticality, local solvers quickly achieve high accuracy, aligning closely with the results of the more computationally intensive global minimization. These findings shed light on how Nature may operate solely through local actions at her disposal.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study the anomalous proximity effect in a ballistic normal metal/diffusive normal metal/superconductor junction based on Rashba semiconductor nanowire model. The system hosts two distinct phases: a trivial helical phase with zero-energy Andreev Bound States and a topological phase with Majorana Bound States. We analyze the local density of states and induced pair correlations at the edge of the normal metal region. We investigate their behavior under scalar onsite disorder and changing the Superconductor and diffusive regions lengths in the trivial helical and topological phases. We find that both phases exhibit a zero-energy peak in the local density of states and spin-triplet pair correlations in the clean limit, which we attribute primarily to odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs. Disorder rapidly splits the zero-energy peak in the trivial helical phase regardless of the lengths of the superconductor and diffusive normal regions. The zero-energy peak in the topological phase show similar fragility when the superconductor region is short. However, for long superconductor regions, the zero-energy peak in the topological phase remain robust against disorder. In contrast, spin-singlet correlations are suppressed near zero energy in both phases. Our results highlight that the robustness of the zero-energy peak against scalar disorder, contingent on the Superconductor region length, serves as a key indicator distinguishing trivial Andreev bound states from topological Majorana bound states.</p>

            <p>This study addresses microstructure selection mechanisms in rapid solidification, specifically targeting the transition from cellular/dendritic to planar interface morphologies under conditions relevant to additive manufacturing. We use a phase-field model that quantitatively captures solute trapping, kinetic undercooling, and morphological instabilities across a broad range of growth velocities ($V$) and thermal gradients ($G$), and apply it to a binary Fe-Cr alloy, as a surrogate for 316L stainless steel. By combining high-fidelity phase-field simulations with a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian active learning approach, we efficiently map the microstructure transitions in the multi-dimensional space of composition, growth velocity, and temperature gradient. We compare our PF results to classical theories for rapid solidification. The classical KGT model yields an accurate prediction of the value of $G$ above which the interface is planar for any growth velocity. Microstructures transition from dendrites to cells as the temperature gradient increases close to this value of $G$. We also identify the occurrence of unstable "intermediate" microstructures at the border between dendritic and planar at low $G$, in the absence of banding instability in this Fe-Cr alloy. Our results highlight the capabilities of Bayesian-guided PF approaches in exploring complex microstructural transitions in multidimensional parameters spaces, thereby providing a robust computational tool for designing process parameters to achieve targeted microstructures and properties in rapidly solidified metallic alloys.</p>

            <p>We studied InSb quantum well devices using Landau level tunneling spectroscopy through a three-terminal differential conductance technique. This method is similar to filled state scanning tunneling microscopy but uses a stationary contact instead of a mobile tip to analyze the two-dimensional electron system. Applying magnetic fields up to 15 T, we identified clear peaks in the differential current-voltage profiles, indicative of Landau level formation. By examining deviations from the expected Landau fan diagram, we extract an absolute value for the exchange-induced energy shift. Through an empirical analysis, we derive a formula describing the exchange shift as a function of both magnetic field strength and electron filling. Our findings indicate that the emptying of the $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ Landau levels causes an exchange interaction energy shift in the $\nu=1$ level. Unlike prior studies that infer level energies relative to one another and report oscillatory g-factor behavior, our method references the energy of the Landau levels above the filled states of the contact under a bias voltage, revealing that only the ground state Landau level experiences a measurable exchange shift.</p>

            <p>We present the electronic transport properties of $\mathrm{BaZrS_3}$ (BZS) thin films grown epitaxially by gas-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We observe n-type behavior in all samples, with carrier concentration ranging from $4 \times 10^{18}$ to $4 \times 10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ at room temperature (RT). We observe a champion RT Hall mobility of 11.1 $\mathrm{cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}}$, which is competitive with established thin-film photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. Temperature-dependent Hall mobility data show that phonon scattering dominates at room temperature, in agreement with computational predictions. X-ray diffraction data illustrate a correlation between mobility and stacking fault concentration, illustrating how microstructure can affect transport. Despite the well-established environmental stability of chalcogenide perovskites, we observe significant changes to electronic properties as a function of storage time in ambient conditions. With the help of secondary-ion mass-spectrometry (SIMS) measurements, we propose and support a defect mechanism that explains this behavior: as-grown films have a high concentration of sulfur vacancies that are shallow donors ($\mathrm{V_S^\bullet}$ or $\mathrm{V_S^{\bullet \bullet}}$), which are converted into neutral oxygen defects ($\mathrm{O_S^\times}$) upon air exposure. We discuss the relevance of this defect mechanism within the larger context of chalcogenide perovskite research, and we identify means to stabilize the electronic properties.</p>

            <p>Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.</p>

            <p>We embark on computing the longitudinal magnetoconductivity within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, where an isotropic triple-point semimetal (TSM) is subjected to collinear electric ($\boldsymbol E $) and magnetic ($\boldsymbol B$) fields. Except for the Drude part, the $B$-dependence arises exclusively from topological properties like the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artifact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. It necessitates the consideration of interband scatterings within the same node as well, providing a complex interplay of intraband, interband, intranode, and internode processes, offering an overwhelmingly rich set of possibilities. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.</p>

            <p>In 1991, V. J. Emery in his important review article entitled "Some aspects of the theory of high temperature superconductors"\cite{emery1} argued against the Zhang-Rice reduction of three-band to an effective one-band model. In his words "...therefore it seems that the simple $t-J$ model does not account for the properties of high temperature superconductors". Over approximately 35 years after the initial debates\cite{debates} much has happened in the field pertaining to this topic. Even though it is one of the most discussed issue, a comprehensive account and the required resolution are lacking. Connected to the debate over one-band versus three-band models is another discussion: the one-component versus two-component model for cuprates. The two-component model is most strongly advocated by Barzykin and Pines\cite{bp}. In this article the author attempts a perspective and a re-look on some of these issues. After an analysis of a large body of literature, author finds that V. J. Emery's criticism of the Zhang-Rice reduction was correct. Many central experimental features of cuprates cannot be rationalized within the one-band model, and Johnston-Nakano scaling is one such example. Other examples are also discussed. Author introduces a simple-minded toy model to illustrate the core issues involved.</p>

            <p>We propose ferroelectric layer sliding as a new approach to realize and manipulate topological quantum states in two-dimensional (2D) bilayer magnetic van der Waals materials. We show that stacking monolayer ferromagnetic topological states into layer-spin-locked bilayer antiferromagnetic structures, and introducing sliding ferroelectricity leads to asynchronous topological evolution of different layers (spins) owing to existence of polarization potentials, thereby giving rise to rich layer-resolved topological phases. As a specific example, by means of a lattice model, we show that a bilayer magnetic 2D second order topological insulator (SOTI) reveals an unrecognized spin-hybrid-order topological insulator after undergoing ferroelectric sliding. Interestingly, in such phase, the spin-up (top layer) and spin-down (bottom layer) channels exhibit first-order and second-order topological properties, respectively. Moreover, other topological phases such as SOTI, quantum spin Hall insulator, quantum anomalous Hall insulator, and trivial insulator can also emerge through changes in the parameters of the system, and the relevant topological indices are also discussed. In terms of materials, based on first principles calculations, we predict material ScI2 can serve as an ideal platform to realize our proposal. Further, we predict that the anomalous Nernst effect of these several topological phases exhibits distinct differences, and therefore can be used as a signal for experimentally probing.</p>

            <p>We screen 4784 stable monolayers from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) and identify 57 ferromagnetic (FM) and 67 antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds that should exhibit linear magnetoelectric (ME) effects. Using density functional theory, we compute contributions from the spin and orbital angular momentum as well as lattice-mediated and clamped-ion analogs to fully characterize the linear ME tensor in the static limit. We observe a general trend that AFM ordering gives rise to a larger ME response compared to FM ordered monolayers. Using a typical van der Waals interlayer distance, we find that AFM $\mathrm{Mn}_2\mathrm{SI}_2$ exhibits the strongest component of linear ME response, providing approximately 580 ps/m. This is two orders of magnitude greater than in prototypical $\mathrm{Cr}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ but comparable to the largest ME response measured in bulk $\mathrm{TbPO}_4$ (280-740 ps/m). We also search for antimagnetoelectricity and find a number of FM and AFM compounds with antiferroic tensor entries. By demonstration of select examples and analysis of our full data set, we argue that inclusion of all contributions (spin, orbital, lattice-mediated and clamped-ion) is of crucial importance for reliable predictions of the total ME response.</p>

            <p>We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Józef Kuśba</p>
            <p>To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The agreement between the basic expressions of the TRMC method and the analogous expressions of the renewal theory has been demonstrated. The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Görkem D. Dinc, André Eckardt, Alexander Schnell</p>
            <p>A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map, also known as quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent generator of Lindblad form, is generally an NP-hard problem. The difficulty is related to the fact that one has to search through all possible branches of the operator logarithm of the map, in order to identify, if any of the resulting effective generators is of Lindblad form. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective generator of Lindblad form. This significantly reduces the complexity of the search for an effective generator of Lindblad form in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.</p>

            <p>How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asaf Farhi, Haim Suchowski</p>
            <p>Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties of anisotropic materials. Here we derive closed-form expressions for the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of uniaxial and biaxial spheres and ellipsoids. We show that such particles exhibit novel radiation patterns and axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting and eigenvalue degeneracy. Finally, we analytically predict the Q-factors of the resonance peaks. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers and apply to other fields of physics.</p>

            <p>We construct a local decoder for the 2D toric code using ideas from the hierarchical classical cellular automata of Tsirelson and Gács. Our decoder is a circuit of strictly local quantum operations preserving a logical state for exponential time in the presence of circuit-level noise without the need for non-local classical computation or communication. Our construction is not translation invariant in spacetime, but can be made time-translation invariant in 3D with stacks of 2D toric codes. This solves the open problem of constructing a local topological quantum memory below four dimensions.</p>

            <p>Phase reconstruction is important in transmission electron microscopy for structural studies. We describe electron Fourier ptychography and its application to phase reconstruction of both radiation-resistant and beam-sensitive materials. We demonstrate that the phase of the exit wave can be reconstructed to high resolution using a modified iterative phase retrieval algorithm using data collected in an alternative optical geometry. This method achieves a spatial resolution of 0.63 nm at a fluence of $4.5 \times 10^2 \, e^-/\text{nm}^2$, as validated on Cry11Aa protein crystals under cryogenic conditions. Notably, this method requires no additional hardware modifications, is straightforward to implement, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing data collection software, providing a broadly accessible alternative approach to structural studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akhil Ayyadevara, Anand Prakash, Shovan Dutta, Arun Paramekanti, S. A. Rangwala</p>
            <p>Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry provides a powerful framework for predicting whether structural transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Trapped laser-cooled ions present a pristine and highly controllable few-body system for studying this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trap potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional unit-cell-sized ion clusters. We probe their distinct dynamical signatures: mode softening indicating a structural instability at a symmetry-breaking continuous transition, stochastic switching between stable structures at a discontinuous transition, and hysteresis near a spinodal point. We also observe a remarkable triple point-like feature where a discontinuous symmetry-changing transition and a continuous symmetry-breaking transition occur simultaneously. Analytical calculations based on symmetry considerations and numerical analysis of collective modes provide a comprehensive understanding of the observed dynamics. Our results demonstrate that tunable Coulomb clusters serve as a versatile platform to elucidate the interplay between symmetry, energy landscapes, and dynamical pathways in structural transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Baptiste Camps, Julien Randon-Furling, Ulysse Godreau</p>
            <p>Our knowledge of past cultures relies considerably on written material. For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies ("stemmata"), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic "biodiversity" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance ("drift") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julius Bohm, Hugo Gerlitz, Christina Jörg, Michael Fleischhauer</p>
            <p>One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength</p>

            <p>Layered 2D van der Waals materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, are promising for nanoscale spintronic and optoelectronic applications. Harnessing their full potential requires understanding both intrinsic transport and the dynamics of optically excited spin and charge carriers -- particularly the transition between excited spin polarization and the conduction band's intrinsic spin texture. Here, we investigate the spin polarization of the conduction bands of bulk WSe$_2$ using static and time-resolved spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, complemented by photocurrent calculations. Electron doping reveals the intrinsic spin polarization, while time-resolved measurements trace the evolution of excited spin carriers. We find that intervalley scattering is spin-conserving, with spin transport initially governed by photoexcited carriers and aligning with the intrinsic conduction band polarization after $\sim$150 fs.</p>

            <h2>1D Transition Metal Oxide Chains as a Challenging Model for Ab Initio Calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jila Amini, Mojtaba Alaei, Stefano de Gironcoli</p>
            <p>Providing highly simplified models of strongly correlated electronic systems that challenge {\it ab initio} calculations can serve as a valuable testing ground to improve these methods. In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of one-dimensional transition metal mono-oxide chains (VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) using density functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$, and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations. The Hubbard $U$ parameter for DFT+$U$ is determined using the linear response theory. In all systems studied except MnO, the presence of multiple local minima -- primarily due to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the d-orbitals -- leads to significant challenges for DFT, DFT+U, and Hartree-Fock methods in finding the global minimum in ab initio calculations. Our results indicate that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is energetically favored for all chains, except CrO, when using DFT+$U$ and PBE. We analyze the electronic band structures and find that while the PBE approximation often predicts metallic or half-metallic ground states for the ferromagnetic (FM) state, DFT+$U$ approach successfully opens band gaps, correctly predicting insulating behavior in all cases. Furthermore, we compared the energy differences between the AFM and FM states using DFT+$U$ and CCSD for CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO and NiO. Our findings indicate that CCSD predicts larger energy differences in some cases compared to DFT+$U$, suggesting that the Hubbard $U$ parameter obtained through linear response theory may be overestimated when used to calculate energy differences between different magnetic states. For CrO, CCSD predicts an AFM ground state, in contrast to the predictions from DFT+$U$ and PBE methods.</p>

            <p>Moir{é} heterostructures, created by stacking two-dimensional (2D) materials together with a finite lattice mismatch or rotational twist, represent a new frontier of designer quantum materials. Typically, however, this requires the painstaking manual assembly of heterostructures formed from exfoliated materials. Here, we observe clear spectroscopic signatures of moir{é} lattice formation in epitaxial heterostructures of monolayer (ML) NbSe$_2$ grown on graphite substrates. Our angle-resolved photoemission measurements and theoretical calculations of the resulting electronic structure reveal moir{é} replicas of the graphite $\pi$ states forming pairs of interlocking Dirac cones. Interestingly, these intersect the NbSe$_2$ Fermi surface at the $\mathbf{k}$-space locations where NbSe$_2$'s charge-density wave (CDW) gap is maximal in the bulk. This provides a natural route to understand the lack of CDW enhancement for ML-NbSe$_2$/graphene as compared to a more than four-fold enhancement for NbSe$_2$ on insulating support substrates, and opens new prospects for using moir{é} engineering for controlling the collective states of 2D materials.</p>

            <p>Magnetic topological systems based on MnBi2Te4 have recently attracted significant attention due to their rich interplay between magnetism and topological electronic states. In this work, using density functional theory (DFT), we investigate topological phase transitions (TPTs) in Mn1-xGexBi2Te4 compounds with both ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering under variations of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength and uniaxial strain along the c axis. We show that the emergence of a Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase requires the crossing of bands with opposite sz spin projections along the {\Gamma}Z direction. Modulation of SOC and strain can annihilate Weyl points via spin-selective hybridization, driving transitions into trivial or topological insulating phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that local asymmetry in Mn/Ge substitution, particularly at 37.5% Ge concentration (Mn0.625Ge0.375Bi2Te4) can locally disrupt AFM interlayer coupling and induce a WSM state even in globally AFM systems, without external remagnetization. To optimize Weyl point separation and enhance the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), we propose partial substitution of Mn by Fe and Te by Se.</p>

            <p>Charge-density wave (CDW) order is a key property of high-Tc cuprates, but its boundaries in the phase diagram and potential connections to other phases remain controversial. We report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in the prototypical cuprate YBa2Cu3Oy demonstrating that short-range static CDW order remains robust at optimal doping (p=0.165), exhibiting a strength and temperature dependence in the normal state similar to those observed at p=0.11 in the underdoped regime. For an overdoped sample with p=0.184, we detect no static CDW down to T=Tc, though weak CDW order plausibly emerges below Tc. More broadly, we argue that both quenched disorder and competition with superconductivity influence the apparent boundary of the CDW phase, likely causing an underestimation of its intrinsic extent in doping. These findings challenge the view that the CDW phase boundary lies below p*=0.19, widely regarded as the critical doping where the pseudogap phase ends in YBa2Cu3Oy.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond exhibit long spin coherence times, optical initialization, and optical spin readout under ambient conditions, making them excellent quantum sensors. However, the conventional scheme for charge state initialization based on off-resonant green excitation results in significant state preparation errors, typically around 30%. One method for improving charge state initialization fidelity is to use multicolor excitation, which has been demonstrated to achieve a near-unity preparation fidelity for bulk NV centers by using a few milliseconds of near-infrared (5 mW) and green (10 {\mu}W) excitation. The translation of such schemes to NV centers near the diamond surface with higher efficiency optical pumping would enable myriad tasks in nanoscale sensing. Here, we demonstrate a protocol for efficient charge initialization of shallow NV centers between 5 nm and 15 nm from the diamond surface. By carefully studying the charge dynamics of shallow NV centers, we identify a region of parameter space that allows for near-unity (95%) charge initialization within 300 {\mu}s of near-infrared (1 mW) and green (10 {\mu}W) excitation. The time to 90% charge initialization can be as fast as 10 {\mu}s for 4 mW of near-infrared and 39 {\mu}W of green illumination. This fast, efficient charge initialization protocol will enable nanoscale sensing applications where state preparation errors currently prohibit scaling, such as measuring higher-order multi-point correlators.</p>

            <p>Controlling quantum interference near avoided energy-level crossings is crucial for fast and reliable coherent manipulation in quantum information processing. However, achieving tunable quantum interference in atomically-precise engineered structures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate electrical control of quantum interference using atomic spins on an insulating film in a scanning tunneling microscope. Using bias voltages applied across the tunnel junction, we modulate the atomically-confined magnetic interaction between the probe tip and surface atoms with a strong electric field, and drive the spin state rapidly through the energy-level anticrossing. This all-electrical manipulation allows us to achieve Landau-Zener-Stückelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry on both single spins and pairs of interacting spins. The LZSM pattern exhibits multiphoton resonances, and its asymmetry suggests that the spin dynamics is influenced by spin-transfer torque of tunneling electrons. Multi-level LZSM spectra measured on coupled spins with tunable interactions show distinct interference patterns depending on their many-body energy landscapes. These results open new avenues for all-electrical quantum manipulation in spin-based quantum processors in the strongly driven regime.</p>

            <p>Orbital magnetism in graphene originates from correlation-driven spontaneous valley symmetry breaking1-7. It can lead to various anomalous transport phenomena such as integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects8-11. In general, the in-plane magnetic field B|| primarily couples to the spin degrees of freedom in graphene and has long been presumed to have a negligible effect on orbital magnetism due to the ultra-weak spin-orbit coupling12-18. In this work, we report multiple unconventional orbital magnetic phenomena that are highly sensitive to the B|| field in graphene/hBN superlattices hosting both integer and fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). We observed chirality-switching behaviors of the Chern insulator at moiré filling factor {\nu} = 1 under a finite B_par, demonstrating that both the C = +-1 states are permissible ground states at zero perpendicular magnetic field B_per. For the FCI at {\nu} = 2/3, we observed topological phase transitions between two states characterized by Hall resistivity \r{ho}xy = +-3h/2e2 under both B_per and B_par fields. In-plane B|| field can effectively suppress the FCI state at zero B_per field and enhance the FCI state with the opposite chirality, as resolved in Landau fan diagrams. Moreover, we observed rich phase transitions at 1 < {\nu} < 2, accompanied by intervalley coherence and anomalous Hall effects (AHE) that can be triggered by sweeping either B_per or B_par. Our work has unveiled new properties of orbital magnetism, providing a new knob for engineering various AHE in graphene.</p>

Furthermore, the internal representation learned by the DNN act as an entropy.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Véronique Brouet, Aaditya Vedant, Francois Bertran, Patrick Le Fèvre, Oleg Rubel</p>
            <p>Metallic kagome lattices are attracting significant attention as they provide a platform to explore the interplay between topology and magnetism. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) plays a key role in unraveling their electronic structure. However, the analysis is often challenging due to the presence of multiple bands near the Fermi level. Indeed, each orbital generates three bands in a kagome lattice due to its three inequivalent sites, which soon becomes complicated if many orbitals are present. To address this complexity, using ARPES matrix elements can be highly beneficial. First, band symmetry can be determined through selection rules based on light polarization. We emphasize that, in kagome lattices, symmetry is not only determined by the orbital character but also by the relative phase between the three sublattices. Additionally, interference between the three sublattices leads to a strong modulation of ARPES intensity across neighboring Brillouin zones. We show how unfolded band calculations capture these modulations, helping with band identification. We apply these ideas to CoSn, whose simple structure retains the key features of a kagome lattice. Taking advantage of these two effects, we isolate the dispersion of each band and discuss novel correlation effects, selectively renormalizing the bands crossing the Fermi level and shifting the others.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas Rasch, Lauriane Chomaz, Thomas Gasenzer</p>
            <p>The emergence of distinctly sub-diffusive scaling in the vicinity of an anomalous non-thermal fixed point is discussed in a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas in the superfluid phase, carrying ensembles of vortices and antivortices with zero net angular momentum. The observed scaling behavior reflects coarsening dynamics driven by the mutual annihilation of vortices and antivortices, with the mean inter-defect distance growing algebraically over time as $\ell_\text{v}(t)\sim t^{\,\beta}$. A sub-diffusive ($\beta<1/2$) exponent $\beta\approx0.2$ is extracted for various parameter regimes, initial conditions, and dipolar configurations from both scaling occupation-number spectra and the evolution of inter-defect distances as well as the corresponding total vortex densities. As vortex-antivortex annihilation progresses, excitations of the background condensate increase. This gives rise to a transition in the scaling behavior at late times, toward a non-thermal fixed point governed by diffusion-type scaling with $\beta\approx1/2$ as expected for the mutual annihilation of well-separated vortex-antivortex dipoles. While the temporal scaling with $\beta$ does not depend significantly on the strength and anisotropy of the dipolar interactions and thus underlines the universality of the anomalous as well as diffusion-type non-thermal fixed points, we find distinctly different vortex patterns resulting in the dipolar case. While in the superfluid with contact interactions only, same-sign vortices tend to cluster and form large-scale eddies, in the dipolar and tilted cases, roton excitations appear to prevent such motion, giving rather rise to a maximisation of distances between vortices of either sign.</p>

By using the substrate of SrLaAlO4(00l), we have successfully synthesized the superconducting thin film of La2PrNi2O7 with Tc(onset) = 41.5 K. Superconducting tunneling spectra are successfully measured on the terraces after we remove the surface layer and expose the superconducting layer by using the tip-excavation technique. The spectrum shows a two-gap structure with Delta1 = 19 meV, Delta2 = 6 meV, and fittings based on the Dynes model indicate that the dominant gap should have an anisotropic s-wave structure, and the pure d-wave model fails to fit the data. Thus, our data put the priority in selecting the s+- among the two arguable pairing models: s+- and d-wave. Assuming the dominant interlayer superconducting gap, we obtain its magnitude to be Delta(perp) = 13 meV, while the intralayer gap Delta(para) is about 6 meV. Our results shed new light in understanding the mystery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Inductive-Effect-Driven Tunability of Magnetism and Lumines-cence in Triangular Layers ANd(SO4)2 (A = Rb, Cs)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xudong Huai, Ebube E. Oyeka, Uchenna Chinaegbomkpa, Michal J. Winiarski, Hugo Sanabria, Thao T. Tran</p>
            <p>Tuning the energy landscape of manybody electronic states in extended solids through the inductive effect-a concept widely used in organic chemistry-offers a new, effective strategy for materials development. Here, we demonstrate this approach using the ANd(SO4)2 (A = Rb, Cs) model system, which possesses different A-site electronegativity and displays a distorted triangular lattice of Nd3+ (4I9/2 ground term). Magnetization data indicate appreciable antiferromagnetic interactions without long-range ordering down to 1.8 K while highlighting the tunable population of the electronic states. Temperature-dependent and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that emissions and nonradiative processes can be modified by the inductive effect at the atomic level. Heat capacity data confirm no magnetic ordering and add insight into the role of phonons in emission lifetime. Density functional theory calculations prove enhanced covalency in the Cs compound compared to the Rb counterpart while acknowledging the adjustable magnetic intralayer and inter-layer exchange pathways. These results demonstrate a viable framework for utilizing the inductive effect as an important knob for simultaneously dialing in magnetic, optical, and electronic properties in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The ambient-temperature high-pressure behaviour of (La0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Gd0.2Yb0.2)2Zr2O7 zirconate (HEZ) nanopowders with three different average particle sizes (~25nm, ~45 nm and ~ 68nm) were studied using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) measurements up to ~30 GPa. Smaller particle-size HEZ nanopowder (~25 nm), synthesized at the lower sintering temperature, exhibits pure defect-fluorite (DF) phase, whereas larger particle-size HEZ nanopowders (~45nm and ~68nm), synthesized at the higher sintering temperature, exhibit mixture of DF and pyrochlore phase (PY). The phase fraction of the PY phase increases with sintering temperature and hence with the particle size. All the HEZ nanopowders exhibit stability of initial structures (DF and PY) up to ~ 30 GPa, though phase fraction of PY phase in larger particle-size HEZ nanopowders successively reduces with pressure which is concomitant with significant variation in ox48f fractional coordinate in PY phase. Both the phases in all the studied samples exhibit anomalous pressure-volume (P-V) behaviour between ~7 to 15 GPa. The anomaly decreases with increasing particle size of HEZ nanopowders. The variation of bond lengths and polyhedron volume with pressure suggests that the anomalous P-V behaviour and structural changes at high pressures are primarily due to the distortion of the polyhedrons in DF and PY structures in HEZ nanopowders.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Kumar, Nirmal Ganguli</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of Rashba-like spin-orbit interaction in the antiferromagnetic BaMnO$_3|$KTaO$_3$ oxide heterostructure using density functional theory (DFT). The analysis of our charge transfer model based on electrostatic potential reveals a type-I band alignment and establishes the conditions under which the interface becomes conducting. Our calculations uncover pronounced linear Rashba splitting ($\alpha_{(1)}$ = 0.114~eVÅ) in Mn 3$d$ bands near the Fermi level, induced by proximity to Ta 5$d$ orbitals of the KTO substrate. The heterostructure exhibits inversion asymmetry due to polar discontinuities at its $p$-type and $n$-type interfaces. Using three-dimensional band dispersions and projected spin textures along with isoenergetic contours obtained from DFT calculations, we confirm the linear Rashba nature of the spin-orbit coupling. Employing Monte Carlo simulations based on DFT-derived magnetic exchange interactions, we estimate a Néel temperature of approximately $\sim 54 \mathrm{~K}$. Our results demonstrate a viable route to engineering strong spin-orbit coupling in centrosymmetric antiferromagnets for spintronics applications.</p>

The observed scaling agrees with theoretical models and suggests the influence of film defects on vortex expulsion dynamics. This instrument enables high-throughput magnetic characterization of superconducting materials and circuits, providing new insight for flux mitigation strategies in scalable superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dengis Simon, Sandro Wimberger, Peter Schlagheck</p>
            <p>We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Administration of pulmonary surfactant is crucial for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of Curosurf atomization via the Endosurf device, a recently developed spray technology, as a promising approach for surfactant delivery in infants with RDS. A comprehensive analysis was performed to evaluate the physicochemical properties of atomized Curosurf, including its surface tension and rheology. The size distribution of Curosurf vesicles was also investigated. An ex vivo respiratory model based on rabbit lungs breathing through an instrumented hypobaric chamber representing the thorax of a preterm infant was developed to provide proof of concept for regional aerosol deposition of atomized Curosurf. The atomization of Curosurf with the innovative Endosurf device did not significantly alter surface tension, but reduced vesicle size and promoted homogeneous distribution of Curosurf in the lungs. Rheological measurements showed the viscoelastic complexity of atomized Curosurf. This preliminary study confirmed the promising potential of Curosurf atomization via the Endosurf device for the distribution of surfactant in the lungs of infants with RDS. These advances could help to improve the treatment of RDS in preterm infants and offer new perspectives for healthcare professionals and affected families.</p>

            <p>Decoherence in superconducting qubits is dominated by defects that reside at amorphous interfaces. Interaction with discrete defects results in dropouts that complicate qubit operation and lead to nongaussian tails in the distribution of qubit energy relaxation time $T_1$ that degrade system performance. Spectral diffusion of defects over time leads to fluctuations in $T_1$, posing a challenge for calibration. In this work, we measure the energy relaxation of flux-tunable transmons over a range of operating frequencies. We vary qubit geometry to change the interface participation ratio by more than an order of magnitude. Our results are consistent with loss dominated by discrete interfacial defects. Moreover, we are able to localize the dominant defects to within 500 nm of the qubit junctions, where residues from liftoff are present. These results motivate new approaches to qubit junction fabrication that avoid the residues intrinsic to the liftoff process.</p>

            <p>The discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with application-specific properties remains a central challenge in materials chemistry, owing to the immense size and complexity of their structural design space. Conventional computational screening techniques such as molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT), while accurate, are computationally prohibitive at scale. Machine learning offers an exciting alternative by leveraging data-driven approaches to accelerate materials discovery. The complexity of MOFs, with their extended periodic structures and diverse topologies, creates both opportunities and challenges for generative modeling approaches. To address these challenges, we present a reinforcement learning-enhanced, transformer-based framework for the de novo design of MOFs. Central to our approach is MOFid, a chemically-informed string representation encoding both connectivity and topology, enabling scalable generative modeling. Our pipeline comprises three components: (1) a generative GPT model trained on MOFid sequences, (2) MOFormer, a transformer-based property predictor, and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL) module that optimizes generated candidates via property-guided reward functions. By integrating property feedback into sequence generation, our method drives the model toward synthesizable, topologically valid MOFs with desired functional attributes. This work demonstrates the potential of large language models, when coupled with reinforcement learning, to accelerate inverse design in reticular chemistry and unlock new frontiers in computational MOF discovery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Monika Sanoria, Gema Malet-Engra, Giorgio Scita, Nir Gov, Ajay Gopinathan</p>
            <p>The collective chemotaxis of multicellular clusters is an important phenomenon in various physiological contexts, ranging from embryonic development to cancer metastasis. Such clusters often display interesting shape dynamics and instabilities, but their physical origin, functional benefits, and role in overall chemotactic migration remain unclear. Here, we combine computational modeling and experimental observations of malignant lymphocyte cluster migration in vitro to understand how these dynamics arise from an interplay of chemotactic response and inter-cellular interactions. Our cell-based computational model incorporates active propulsion of cells, contact inhibition of locomotion, chemoattractant response, as well as alignment, adhesive, and exclusion interactions between cells. We find that clusters remain fluid and maintain cohesive forward migration in low chemoattractant gradients. However, above a threshold gradient, clusters display an instability driven by local cluster-shape dependent velocity differentials that causes them to elongate perpendicular to the gradient and eventually break apart. Comparison with our in vitro data shows the predicted transition to the cluster instability regime with increased gradient, as well as quantitative agreement with key features such as cluster aspect ratio, orientation, and breaking frequency. This instability naturally limits the size of multicellular aggregates, and, in addition, clusters in the instability regime display optimal forward migration speeds, suggesting functional implications in vivo. Our work provides valuable insights into generic instabilities of chemotactic clusters, elucidates physical factors that could contribute to metastatic spreading, and can be extended to other living or synthetic systems of active clusters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanchen Liu, Xiao Chen</p>
            <p>We investigate the stability of logical information in quantum stabilizer codes subject to coherent unitary errors. Beginning with a logical state, we apply a random unitary error channel and subsequently measure stabilizer checks, resulting in a syndrome-dependent post-measurement state. By examining both this syndrome state and the associated syndrome distribution, we identify a phase transition in the behavior of the logical state. Below a critical error threshold pc, the syndrome state remains in the same logical state, enabling successful recovery of the code's logical information via suitable error-correction protocols. Above pc, however, the syndrome state shifts to a different logical state, signaling the breakdown of efficient error correction. Notably, this process can often induce an effective unitary rotation within the logical space. This transition is accompanied by qualitative changes in both the global and local features of the syndrome distribution. We refer to this phenomenon as a coherent error induced phase transition. To illustrate this transition, we present two classes of quantum error correcting code models the toric code and non-local random stabilizer codes thereby shedding light on the design and performance limits of quantum error correction under coherent errors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ademola Soyemi, Khagendra Baral, Tibor Szilvasi</p>
            <p>Chemical potential of species in solution is essential for understanding various chemical processes at interfaces. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, constrained by fixed compositions, cannot satisfy a constant chemical potential condition as solute species can migrate to the interface and deplete the bulk due to solute-interface interactions. In this study, we introduce a simple and computationally efficient approach named iterative constant chemical potential molecular dynamics (iCuMD) simulation, which helps simulate targeted molar concentrations of species in solution. iCuMD overcomes the limitations of conventional MD by adjusting the number of species in the solution to reach a target concentration (chemical potential). We demonstrate our approach using solid-liquid and liquid-air interfacial systems as case studies. Specifically, we perform classical force field-based MD simulations of NaCl(aq)-air and NaCl(aq)-graphite interfaces and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-based MD simulations of the Na2SO4(aq)-graphene interface. Our results show that the iCuMD approach efficiently achieves the desired bulk ion concentration within two iterations and can also be integrated with MLIP-driven simulations which enable constant potential simulations with DFT-level accuracy. We show that iCuMD offers a robust and simple computational framework for constant chemical potential simulations as its only requirement is to be able to converge interfacial simulations with a measurable bulk region.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. L. Krapivsky</p>
            <p>Dynamic space filling (DSF) is a stochastic process defined on any connected graph. Each vertex can host an arbitrary number of particles forming a pile, with every arriving particle landing on the top of the pile. Particles in a pile, except for the particle at the bottom, can hop to neighboring vertices. Eligible particles hop independently and stochastically, with the overall hopping rate set to unity for every eligible particle at every vertex. When the number of vertices in a graph is equal to the total number of particles, the evolution stops at the moment when every vertex gets occupied by a single particle. We determine the halting time distribution on complete graphs. Using the mapping of the DSF into a two-species annihilation process, we argue that on $d-$dimensional tori with $N\gg 1$ vertices, the average halting time scales with the number of vertices as $N^{4/d}$ when $d\leq 4$ and as $N$ when $d>4$.</p>

            <p>Simulating correlated materials on present-day quantum hardware remains challenging due to limited quantum resources. Quantum embedding methods offer a promising route by reducing computational complexity through the mapping of bulk systems onto effective impurity models, allowing more feasible simulations on pre- and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. This work develops a quantum-classical embedding framework based on the ghost Gutzwiller approximation to enable quantum-enhanced simulations of ground-state properties and spectral functions of correlated electron systems. Circuit complexity is analyzed using an adaptive variational quantum algorithm on a statevector simulator, applied to the infinite-dimensional Hubbard model with increasing ghost mode numbers from 3 to 5, resulting in circuit depths growing from 16 to 104. Noise effects are examined using a realistic error model, revealing significant impact on the spectral weight of the Hubbard bands. To mitigate these effects, the Iceberg quantum error detection code is employed, achieving up to 40% error reduction in simulations. Finally, the accuracy of the density matrix estimation is benchmarked on IBM and Quantinuum quantum hardware, featuring distinct qubit-connectivity and employing multiple levels of error mitigation techniques.</p>

            <p>Transport of elementary excitations is a fundamental property of 2D semiconductors, important for wide-ranging emergent phenomena and device applications. While exciton transport reported in 2D materials barely exceeds 1-2 $\mu$m, coherent coupling of excitons with photons to form polaritons allows not only greatly enhanced transport length, but also the potential to leverage photonic mode engineering for novel transport properties. However, conventional vertical cavity or waveguide polaritons are difficult to tune or integrate into photonic circuits. Here, we report the transport of transition-metal dichalcogenide polaritons in slab 2D photonic crystals that are highly versatile for tuning, mode-engineering and integration. We show an order-of-magnitude enhancement of the transport length compared to that of bare excitons. We further show the dependence of transport on the polariton dispersion and population dynamics, which we control by varying the photonic crystal design and pumping intensity. Stimulated relaxation observed in the system suggests the potential for forming superfluid polaritons with frictionless transport. These results demonstrate the 2D photonic crystal polariton system as a versatile platform to enhance and manipulate energy transport for novel photonic technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debasish Sarker, Yi Zhang, Lynn K. Perry, Daniel S. Messinger, Chaoming Song</p>
            <p>Collective human movement is a hallmark of complex systems, exhibiting emergent order across diverse settings, from pedestrian flows to biological collectives. In high-speed scenarios, alignment interactions ensure efficient flow and navigation. In contrast, alignment in low-speed, socially engaged contexts emerges not from locomotion goals but from interpersonal interaction. Using high-resolution spatial and orientation data from preschool classrooms, we uncover a sharp, distance-dependent transition in pairwise alignment patterns that reflects a spontaneous symmetry breaking between distinct behavioral phases. Below a critical threshold of approximately 0.65\,m, individuals predominantly align side-by-side; beyond this range, face-to-face orientations prevail. We show that this transition arises from a distance-dependent competition among three alignment mechanisms: parallelization, opposition, and reciprocation, whose interplay generates a bifurcation structure in the effective interaction potential. A Fourier-based decomposition of empirical orientation distributions reveals these mechanisms, enabling the construction of a minimal pseudo-potential model that captures the alignment transition as a non-equilibrium phase transition. Monte Carlo simulations using the inferred interaction terms closely reproduce the empirical patterns. These findings establish a quantitative framework for social alignment in low-speed human motion, extending active matter theory to a previously unexplored regime of socially mediated orientation dynamics, with implications for modeling coordination and control in biological collectives and artificial swarms.</p>

            <p>Understanding the origin of phase synchronization between quantum self-sustained oscillators has garnered significant interest in recent years. In this work, we study phase synchronization in three settings: between two continuous-variable oscillators, between two arbitrary quantum spins, and within a hybrid setup involving a spin and an oscillator. We derive a simple and general condition on the elements of the joint density matrix that must be satisfied for them to contribute to the relative phase distribution. In particular, we identify the subset of coherence elements in the joint density matrix that serve as key resources for enabling quantum phase synchronization. Our theory is validated against the previously proposed interaction models known to induce synchronization between the self-sustained oscillators. Moreover, our approach offers valuable insights into the relationship between phase synchronization and various information-theoretic measures.</p>

Here, we show that by tuning the operating temperatures and the magnitude of the coupling between machine and load, the thermal machine can operate in four modes: engine, accelerator, heater, or refrigerator. In particular, we show that as we increase the coupling strength, the engine mode is suppressed, and the refrigerator mode is no longer attainable, leaving the heater as the most pronounced functioning modality, followed by the accelerator. This regime switching can be amplified by quantum effects, such as the bosonic enhancement factor for a harmonic oscillator load, which modifies the effective machine-load coupling, making the thermodynamic functioning sensitive to the initial preparation of the load.</p>

            <p>As a machine-learned potential, the neuroevolution potential (NEP) method features exceptional computational efficiency and has been successfully applied in materials science. Constructing high-quality training datasets is crucial for developing accurate NEP models. However, the preparation and screening of NEP training datasets remain a bottleneck for broader applications due to their time-consuming, labor-intensive, and resource-intensive nature. In this work, we have developed NepTrain and NepTrainKit, which are dedicated to initializing and managing training datasets to generate high-quality training sets while automating NEP model training. NepTrain is an open-source Python package that features a bond length filtering method to effectively identify and remove non-physical structures from molecular dynamics trajectories, thereby ensuring high-quality training datasets. NepTrainKit is a graphical user interface (GUI) software designed specifically for NEP training datasets, providing functionalities for data editing, visualization, and interactive exploration. It integrates key features such as outlier identification, farthest-point sampling, non-physical structure detection, and configuration type selection. The combination of these tools enables users to process datasets more efficiently and conveniently. Using $\rm CsPbI_3$ as a case study, we demonstrate the complete workflow for training NEP models with NepTrain and further validate the models through materials property predictions. We believe this toolkit will greatly benefit researchers working with machine learning interatomic potentials.</p>

            <p>We derive stretching and bending energies for isotropic elastic plates and shells. Through the dimensional reduction of a bulk elastic energy quadratic in Biot strains, we obtain two-dimensional bending energies quadratic in bending measures featuring a bilinear coupling of stretches and geometric curvatures. For plates, the bending measure is invariant under spatial dilations and naturally extends primitive bending strains for straight rods. For shells or naturally-curved rods, the measure is not dilation invariant, and contrasts with previous \emph{ad hoc} postulated forms. The corresponding field equations and boundary conditions feature moments linear in the bending measures, and a decoupling of stretching and bending such that application of a pure moment results in isometric deformation of a unique neutral surface, primitive behaviors in agreement with classical linear response but not displayed by commonly used analytical models. We briefly comment on relations between our energies, those derived from a neo-Hookean bulk energy, and a commonly used discrete model for flat membranes. Although the derivation requires consideration of stretch and rotation fields, the resulting energy and field equations can be expressed entirely in terms of metric and curvature components of deformed and reference surfaces.</p>

            <h2>Adiabatic observables and Berry curvatures in insulators and metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raffaele Resta</p>
            <p>A sharp definition of what "adiabatic" means is given; it is then shown that the time-dependent expectation value of a quantum-mechanical observable in the adiabatic limit can be expressed -- in many cases -- by means of the appropriate Berry curvature. Condensed-matter observables belonging to this class include: Born effective charges in insulators and in metals, quantized Faraday charges in electrolytes, and linear dc conductivities (longitudinal and transverse). Remarkably, the adiabatic limit is well defined even in metals, despite the absence of a spectral gap therein. For all of the above observables the explicit Berry-curvature expressions are derived in a general many-body setting, which also allows for compact and very transparent notations and formulas. Their conversion into band-structure formulas in the independent-electron crystalline case is straightforward.</p>

            <h2>Merons, hedgehogs and magnetoelectric switching in spiral multiferroics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Maranzana, Naoto Nagaosa, Sergey Artyukhin</p>
            <p>In spiral multiferroics, magnetism induces ferroelectricity, thus holding a promise for novel memory devices where an electric field switches magnetic bits. However, such a switching process, in which magnetic domain walls are moved electrically, is still poorly understood. We find multiferroic domain walls containing arrays of meron (half-skyrmion) strings with a plethora of topological defects, which profoundly affect wall dynamics. Minimum energy walls have alternating meron topological charges and move as relativistic massive particles, with velocity limited by the magnon speed. During domain nucleation, walls with non-alternating meron charges appear. Such defects result in a peculiar non-local dynamics where all the spins in the system rotate, and the wall mobility is suppressed. Meron strings possess 0D hedgehog defects, analogous to Bloch points, that pin the wall to the lattice. This fascinating interplay of magnetoelectric switching with a variety of topological defects and non-local spin dynamics opens a new playground for the electric manipulation of spins.</p>

            <h2>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Taige Wang, Tomohiro Soejima, Roger S. K. Mong, Shinsei Ryu</p>
            <p>A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. We also show that thermal and electric Hall conductivity of Abelian topological order can be extracted by partial rotations. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</p>

            <p>A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term, and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.</p>

            <h2>Efficient conversion from fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tong Liu, Ying-Hai Wu, Hong-Hao Tu, Tao Xiang</p>
            <p>Fermionic Gaussian states are eigenstates of quadratic Hamiltonians and are widely used in quantum many-body problems. We propose a highly efficient algorithm that converts fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states. It can be formulated for finite-size systems without translation invariance, but becomes particularly appealing when applied to infinite systems with translation invariance. If the ground states of a topologically ordered system on infinite cylinders are expressed as matrix product states, then the fixed points of the transfer matrix can be harnessed to filter out the anyon eigenbasis, also known as minimally entangled states. This allows for efficient computation of universal properties, such as the entanglement spectrum and modular matrices. The potential of our method is demonstrated by numerical calculations in two chiral spin liquids that have the same topological orders as the bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states, respectively. The anyon eigenbasis for the first one has been worked out before and serves as a useful benchmark. The anyon eigenbasis of the second one is, however, not transparent, and its successful construction provides a nontrivial corroboration of our method.</p>

            <h2>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolay Ebel, Tom Kennedy, Slava Rychkov</p>
            <p>Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</p>

            <h2>Shear stresses in fluid and solid membranes with bending elasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Dharmavaram, J. A. Hanna</p>
            <p>Comparison of a few simple models of fluid and solid membranes illustrates how shear stresses can arise from a bending energy through a coupling between curvature and surface stresses, a feature incidental to the fluid or solid nature of the material. In particular, it is shown how a fluid-like Helfrich bending energy contributes shear stresses, while a related solid-like energy, the correct continuum limit of a Seung-Nelson discrete bending term, produces a stress tensor with purely isotropic tangential part. A distinction is noted between the resistance to tangential flows on the surface and the ability to support tangential stresses. The tangential projection of the divergence of the stress, or the pseudomomentum balance, is viewed in the light of some statements and observations in the literature. Different types of constraints, invariance properties, and shape equations are briefly discussed. The state of a patch of unidirectionally-bent material is connected with prior analyses of the pulling of membrane tethers.</p>

            <p>We perform a structural analysis of large scale jammed packings of monodisperse, frictionless and frictional spheres to elucidate structural signatures of the static structure factor in the low-to-intermediate wavenumber ($q$) region. We employ discrete element method simulations containing up to eighty million particles, in which the particle friction coefficient(s), including sliding, rolling, and twisting interactions, are varied. At intermediate $q$ values, corresponding to length scales that lie between that of the nearest neighbor primary peak and the system size, we find the emergence of a prepeak -- a signature of intermediate range order -- that grows with increasing friction. We correlate the emergence of this peak to real space fluctuations in the local particle coordination number, which exhibits a grainy fluctuating field throughout the packing process that is retained in the final, mechanically stable state. While the formation of the prepeak shows varying degrees of robustness to packing protocol changes, our results suggest that preparation history may be used to construct packings with variable large length scale structural properties.</p>

            <h2>Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken-ichi Amano</p>
            <p>Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</p>

            <h2>Optical Properties and Spin States of Inter-layer Carbon Defect Pairs in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: A First-Principles Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Chacon, Andrea Echeverri, Carlos Cardenas, Francisco Munoz</p>
            <p>Substitutional carbon defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are prominent single photon emitters (SPEs), and their potential for spin activity ($S\geq1$) is particularly intriguing. While studies have largely focused on intra-layer defects, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate inter-layer dimers of identical carbon species (C$_X$C$_X$). We demonstrate that these C$_X$C$_X$ pairs can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature when closely spaced (e.g., within 3.5-7.1 Å) across hBN layers. As their separation increases beyond this range (e.g., $>7$ Å), they transition into weakly interacting $S=1/2$ pairs, characterized by singlet-triplet degeneracy. This regime is predicted to result in a very small zero-field splitting for the triplet manifold, offering a potential explanation for certain optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signals. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of these inter-layer C$_X$C$_X$ pairs is found to be practically monochromatic and within the visible range. Furthermore, we identify specific C$_B$C$_B$ inter-layer configurations exhibiting atypical low-energy phonon replicas due to out-of-plane vibrational coupling, a finding that may clarify the vibronic structure of other hBN emitters, such as the 'yellow emitters'.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement as a topological marker in harmonically confined attractive Fermi-Hubbard chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marina Sanino, Isaac Carvalho, Vivian França</p>
            <p>We investigate the single-site von Neumann entropy along a harmonically confined superfluid chain, as described by the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model with strongly attractive interactions. We find that by increasing the confinement (or equivalently the particle filling) the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid (SF) to a non-trivial topological insulator (TI) phase, which is characterized by an insulating bulk surrounded by highly entangled superfluid edges. These highly entangled states are found to be robust against perturbations and topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry, which is locally preserved. We also find a semi-quantitative agreement between entanglement and superconducting order parameter profiles, confirming then that entanglement can be used as a topological marker and an order parameter in these systems. The charge gap not only confirms the SF-TI transition, but also shows that this transition is mediated by a metallic intermediate regime within the bulk. Using the gap we could depict a phase diagram for which the non-trivial topological insulator can be found in such harmonically confined attractive systems.</p>

            <p>This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline Dy$_2$CoCrO$_6$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.</p>

We identify the conditions necessary for the emergence of PMM modes by precisely tuning the superconducting phases of the terminals and the inter-junction coupling between the 3TJJs. To validate our findings, we perform numerical simulations that account for disorder in a more general geometry and test experimentally feasible protocols based on conductance measurements to reliably detect these modes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on magnetic fields, our design eliminates the need for such fields, potentially increasing the energy-level resolution and significantly expanding the range of compatible semiconductor materials, such as Ge-based heterostructures.</p>

We find that interlayer interactions favor a $d_{xy}$-wave superconducting pairing symmetry over the $s^{\pm}$-wave symmetry, which has been found to prevail when interlayer interactions are disregarded. Moreover, our findings indicate that interlayer interactions enhance the interorbital pairing, incorporating contributions from all three electron pockets, arising from both $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character, resulting in nodes within the gap function (not present in the $s^{\pm}$-wave state) and consequently favoring the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing.</p>

            <p>Entanglement of spin degree of freedom can drastically alter the orbital exchange symmetry of electrons, switching their bunching and antibunching behaviors and the resultant current correlations in the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss interferometry. Here, we investigate the exchange correlation of quasiparticles with entanglement encoded in the Nambu spinors, or the electron-hole degree of freedom. In contrast to the conventional correspondence between spin entanglement and current correlation, we find that singlet (triplet) entanglement of Nambu spinors results in suppressed (enhanced) current correlation. This effect arises because the charge degree of freedom itself encodes the entanglement. We propose implementing this phenomenon in the edge states of a quantum Hall system, where the entangled states of the Nambu spinors can be continuously tuned by gate voltages. Our study reveals a novel relationship between entanglement and charge correlations, offering an effective approach for detecting entanglement of Nambu spinors.</p>

            <p>Both Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) are known to promote intrinsic contributions to the magnon Hall effects such as the thermal Hall and the spin Nernst effects in collinear magnets. Previously, it was reported that a sign change in those transversal transport coefficients only appears in the presence of Kitaev interaction, but not for DMI, which qualitatively distinguishes both kinds of spin-anisotropic interactions in ferromagnets. Herein, we systematically study how the magnon-mediated heat, spin, and orbital transport in longitudinal and transverse geometries evolves with a continuously varying Kitaev-to-DMI ratio, but a fixed magnon band structure. We show that several transport coefficients feature temperature-driven sign changes in the presence of Kitaev interaction, which are absent for DMI. In particular, we find a sign change in longitudinal orbital transport, the magnon orbital Seebeck effect, which is absent in the transverse geometry, the magnon orbital Nernst effect. This sets the orbital transport apart from the heat and spin transport, where we only find sign changes promoted by the Kitaev interaction in transverse, but not in the longitudinal geometry.</p>

We confirm diamond sets the upper bound of thermal conductivity within our search space, very likely also among all stable crystalline solids at ambient conditions.

Then the stationary measure is delta-correlated Gaussian and the dynamical exponent is obtained numerically to be close to $z = \tfrac{3}{2}$. We observed that the scaling functions of the dynamic correlator change smoothly when varying $X$. In this contribution, the analysis is extended to the whole $X$-$Y$-$T$ plane. Solutions are stable only if $XY \geq 0$. Based on numerical simulations, the static correlator still has rapid decay. We argue that the parameter space is foliated into distinct universality classes. They are labeled by $X$ and consist of half-planes parallel to the $Y$-$T$ plane containing the point $(X,X,1)$.</p>

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$ at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of the spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p>

            <p>Introduced by Boltzmann under the name "monode," the microcanonical ensemble serves as the fundamental representation of equilibrium thermodynamics in statistical mechanics by counting all possible realizations of a system's states. Ensemble theory connects this idea with probability and information theory, leading to the notion of Shannon-Gibbs entropy and, ultimately, to the principle of maximum caliber describing trajectories of systems--in and out of equilibrium. While the latter phenomenological generalization reproduces many results of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, given a proper choice of observables, its physical justification remains an open area of research. What is the microscopic origin and physical interpretation of this variational approach? What guides the choice of relevant observables? We address these questions by extending Boltzmann's method to a microcanonical caliber principle and counting realizations of a system's trajectories--all assumed equally probable. Maximizing the microcanonical caliber under the imposed constraints, we systematically develop generalized detailed-balance relations, clarify the statistical origins of inhomogeneous transport, and provide an independent derivation of key equations from stochastic thermodynamics. This approach introduces a dynamical ensemble theory for nonequilibrium steady states in spatially extended and active systems. While verifying the equivalence of ensembles, e.g. those of Norton and Thevenin, our framework contests other common assumptions about nonequilibrium regimes, with supporting evidence provided by stochastic simulations. Our theory suggests further connections to the first principles of microscopic dynamics in classical statistical mechanics, which are essential for investigating systems where the necessary conditions for thermodynamic behavior are not satisfied.</p>

Rather than focusing on specific parameter choices, we study ensembles of systems where the inter-species interaction coefficients and average densities are sampled from probability distributions. We show that non-reciprocity stabilizes the homogeneous mixed state even in the presence of compositional disorder. Using random matrix theory, we derive a general condition for the onset of spinodal instability, which we verify through simulations. Finally, we illustrate the connection between the statistics of the most unstable eigenvalue and the emergent nonlinear dynamics.</p>

Short acoustic wavepackets enable another unexplored resonant interaction regime -- the Cherenkov radiation of spin waves. This raises a question regarding the criteria and signatures of these three regimes of picosecond this http URL, we use a scanning magneto-optical pump-probe technique to directly observe all three regimes of interaction between laser-driven acoustic and magnetostatic wavepackets in a thin permalloy film and a waveguide fabricated on Si substrate. Direct measurements of the phase velocities reveal the transition from a coupled magneto-elastic wavepacket to Cherenkov-like radiation and the non-resonant regime, controlled by the detuning between magnon and phonon group velocities. The acoustic pulse is found to be affected by the excited magnetization dynamics only in the magneto-elastic regime.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruben Burkard, Benedikt Schneider, Björn Sbierski</p>
            <p>For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. We address this challenge by introducing a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion as an efficient numerical approach to the DSF for arbitrary lattices. We focus on the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model and spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We present a user-friendly numerical implementation and provide comprehensive benchmarks on spin chains. As applications we treat a variety of frustrated two- and three dimensional antiferromagnets. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for a S=1 pyrochlore material.</p>

            <p>Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. This work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground-state properties of materials using IR-active phonons.</p>

            <h2>Robustness of topological edge states in alternating spin chains against environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Sattler, Maria Daghofer</p>
            <p>Both the Haldane spin-$1$ chain and dimerized chains of spin-$1/2$ exhibit topologically protected edge states that are robust against specific perturbations. Recently, such spin chains have been specifically assembled on surfaces and we investigate here the robustness of these edge states against coupling to the surface. Since no physical system can be considered perfectly isolated, it is crucial to examine whether topological robustness is maintained in the presence of environmental coupling. We apply exact diagonalization to a Lindblad master equation that couples an alternating Heisenberg spin chain based on spins $1/2$ to a surface via various jump operators. The robustness of topological states is assessed via the time evolution of quantities such as the ground-state degeneracy, correlation function, entropy, and magnetization of edge states. We investigate chains built from dimers with antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic intra-dimer coupling, which resemble Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Haldane models, resp., and assess the impact of $z$-axis anisotropy and longer-ranged couplings. Generally, we find that signatures of topological properties are more robust in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like chains than in Haldane-like chains.</p>

            <h2>Simulating Neutral Atom Quantum Systems with Tensor Network States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Allen, Matthew Otten, Stephen Gray, Bryan K. Clark</p>
            <p>In this paper, we describe a tensor network simulation of a neutral atom quantum system under the presence of noise, while introducing a new purity-preserving truncation technique that compromises between the simplicity of the matrix product state and the positivity of the matrix product density operator. We apply this simulation to a near-optimized iteration of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on a transverse field Ising model in order to investigate the influence of large system sizes on the performance of the algorithm. We find that while circuits with a large number of qubits fail more often under noise that depletes the qubit population, their outputs on a successful measurement are just as robust under Rydberg atom dissipation or qubit dephasing as smaller systems. However, such circuits might not perform as well under coherent multi-qubit errors such as Rydberg atom crosstalk. We also find that the optimized parameters are especially robust to noise, suggesting that a noisier quantum system can be used to find the optimal parameters before switching to a cleaner system for measurements of observables.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxiang Xu, Jiangke Tao, Bin Chen</p>
            <p>While the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) play crucial roles in transforming ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work across diverse biological systems, the exact temporal relationship between these events continues to be intensely debated. In this study, from a functional perspective, we computationally investigate the impact of Pi-release kinetics during the power stroke on muscle contraction dynamics. By implementing a mechanics model of the sarcomere unit that comprehensively incorporates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosin molecules, we successfully replicate a broad range of experimental observations through parameter variation. Our simulation results reveal that delayed Pi-release can significantly enhance energy efficiency during muscle contraction. This work suggests that a gradual Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the lever arm swing may offer a route to adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby modulating the power stroke to influence muscle contraction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Atanasov, Jacob A. Zavatone-Veth, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
            <p>Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p>

            <p>Optically active spin defects in solids are leading candidates for quantum sensing and quantum networking. Recently, single spin defects were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a layered van der Waals (vdW) material. Due to its two-dimensional structure, hBN allows spin defects to be positioned closer to target samples than in three-dimensional crystals, making it ideal for atomic-scale quantum sensing, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single molecules. However, the chemical structures of these defects remain unknown, and detecting a single nuclear spin with an hBN spin defect has been elusive. In this study, we created single spin defects in hBN using $^{13}$C ion implantation and identified three distinct defect types based on hyperfine interactions. We observed both S=1 and S=1/2 spin states within a single hBN spin defect. We demonstrated atomic-scale NMR and coherent control of individual nuclear spins in a vdW material, with a $\pi$-gate fidelity up to 99.75% at room temperature. By comparing experimental results with density-functional theory calculations, we propose chemical structures for these spin defects. Our work advances the understanding of single spin defects in hBN and provides a pathway to enhance quantum sensing using hBN spin defects with nuclear spins as quantum memories.</p>

            <h2>Collectively-modified inter-molecular electron correlations: The connection of polaritonic chemistry and spin glass physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Sidler, Michael Ruggenthaler, Angel Rubio</p>
            <p>Polaritonic chemistry has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to pioneering experimental results, which show that site- and bond-selective chemistry at room temperature is achievable through strong collective coupling to field fluctuations in optical cavities. Despite these notable experimental strides, the underlying theoretical mechanisms remain unclear. In this focus review, we highlight a fundamental theoretical link between the seemingly unrelated fields of polaritonic chemistry and spin glasses, exploring its profound implications for the theoretical framework of polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we present a mapping of the dressed many-molecules electronic-structure problem under collective vibrational strong coupling to the spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) model of a spin glass. This mapping uncovers a collectively induced instability of the intermolecular electron correlations, which could provide the long sought-after seed for significant local chemical modifications in polaritonic chemistry. Overall, the qualitative predictions made from the SSK model (e.g., dispersion effects, phase transitions, differently modified bulk and rare event properties, heating,...) agree well with available experimental observations. Our connection paves the way to incorporate, adjust and probe numerous spin glass concepts in polaritonic chemistry, such as modified fluctuation-dissipation relations, (non-equilibrium) aging dynamics, time-reversal symmetry breaking or stochastic resonances. Ultimately, the connection also offers fresh insights into the applicability of spin glass theory beyond condensed matter systems suggesting novel theoretical directions such as spin glasses with explicitly time-dependent (random) interactions.</p>

            <p>The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.</p>

            <h2>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</p>

            <p>For quantum field theories with global symmetry, we can study the behavior of the partition function with the background gauge field to diagnose different quantum phases. For the case of discrete symmetries, we find that the symmetry-twisted partition function works as an order parameter that discriminates spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states, and symmetry-enriched topological (SET) states. We then consider its application to the case of 4d Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matters to understand the relation between the twisted partition function and the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. We also study its behavior for the spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry and interpret the result from the viewpoint of the mixed anomaly with the emergent solitonic symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sen Niu, Jason Alicea, D. N. Sheng, Yang Peng</p>
            <p>Helical trilayer graphene realizes a versatile moiré system in which anomalous Hall effects have been recently observed at integer and fractional fillings. Focusing on helical trilayers near the magic angle and under a substrate potential, we demonstrate that an isolated higher Chern band with Chern number $|C_{band}|=2$ emerges, enabling the exploration of many-body states beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm. We use exact diagonalization to predict a rich phase diagram of gapped states unattainable in a single $|C_{band}|=1$ band. At filling $\nu=2/3$, we identify a quantum Hall crystal with integer Hall conductance $|\sigma_{H}|=e^2/h$ coexisting with a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ charge density wave order. At $\nu=1/2$, we find a quantum Hall pseudospin ferromagnet featuring extensive ground state degeneracy, Hall conductance $|\sigma_{H}|=e^2/h$, and $2\times 2$ charge order. Finally, at $\nu=1/3$ we find a translation-symmetric fractional Chern insulator with $|\sigma_{H}|=2e^2/3h$. By incorporating spin and valley degrees of freedom, we identify an optimal filling regime $\nu_{\rm{total}}=3+\nu$, where three flavors are fully filled, leaving the fourth at partial filling $\nu$. Notably, inter-flavor interactions renormalize the bandwidth and stabilize all the gapped phases even in realistic parameter regimes away from the chiral limit.</p>

            <p>Electrons floating on a solid neon exhibit long charge coherence times, making them attractive for hybrid quantum systems. When combined with high-quality, high-impedance superconducting resonators and a local magnetic field gradient, this platform enables strong charge-photon and spin-charge coupling -- key ingredients for scalable spin qubit architectures. In this work, we fabricated NbTiN superconducting nanowire resonators and measured internal quality factors around $10^5$. We successfully deposited several hundred-nanometer-thick layers of solid neon, followed by gradual electron loading. The presence of neon and electrons was confirmed via resonance frequency shifts without degradation of the resonator's quality factor. These results demonstrate that NbTiN superconducting nanowire resonators are compatible with electrons-on-neon systems and suitable for future qubit experiments. We further performed a theoretical analysis of optimized micro-magnet configurations, showing that spin qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.99% for single-qubit and 99.9% for two-qubit operations are achievable using natural neon at the charge sweet spot.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsan Huang, Zhiyuan Sun</p>
            <p>Optical cavities have been widely applied to manipulate the properties of solid state materials inside it. We propose that in systems embedded within optical cavities driven by incident pump light, the pump induces generic phase transitions into new non-equilibrium steady states. This effect arises from the ponderomotive potential, the effective static potential exerted by the pump on the low energy degrees of freedom, which exhibits a universal step-like structure that pushes the matter degrees of freedom in the direction that red-shifts the cavity photon modes. For a two dimensional electron liquid in a driven cavity, this step-like potential pushes the electron density to jump to a smaller value so that a hybrid cavity photon mode is red shifted to slightly below the pump frequency. Similarly, for a disordered superconductor in such a driven cavity, this potential acts on the superconducting order parameter and causes a first order phase transition to a new steady state with a smaller gap. By realistic electromagnetic modeling of the cavity, we construct the non-equilibrium phase diagrams for experimentally relevant devices.</p>

            <p>Maximizing the interaction between chiral light and chiral matter is pivotal for the advancement of technologies enabling optical detection that distinguishes between different handedness in chiral organic molecules. One strategy involves developing a resonator that sustains photonic modes with non-zero electromagnetic handedness, which interact differently with chiral molecules of opposite enantiomers. When chiral molecules are positioned in resonator hotspots, they can alter the system's characteristics due to their inherent electric and magnetic transition dipole moments. In this study, we explore this interaction by incorporating the Lorentz pole into the macroscopic parameters of the chiral medium: dielectric permittivity, magnetic permeability, and chirality coefficient. The latter, also known as the Pasteur parameter, is a dimensionless macroscopic measure indicating the medium's chirality, interlinking electric and magnetic fields in the constitutive relations. We show that introducing the Lorentz pole into these macroscopic material parameters of the chiral medium results in chiral strong coupling between light and matter, with the strength of coupling determined by both the medium's chirality and the photonic mode's chirality.</p>

            <p>The sound propagation properties resulting from a dynamical axion insulator generated from a Weyl semimetal are explored. Due to the axial electron-phonon coupling, the speed of sound in the material and its attenuation is seen to be modified. At the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) level, it is seen that the axion obstructs a stronger modification of the speed of sound for longitudinal waves propagating parallel to the Axionic Charge Density Wave (ACDW) wavevector but not for transverse waves. On the other hand, the attenuation is modified by effects beyond the RPA, but the axionic contribution is negligible. These effects can be probed in sound propagation experiments without invoking the axial anomaly, which would require an additional electric field. We also discuss the importance of axial electron-phonon interactions with respect to the more conventional vector interactions in these systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seiji Aota, Masaaki Tanaka</p>
            <p>A newly identified class of magnetic materials called altermagnets has attracted much attention due to the practical properties of spin-splitting bands akin to ferromagnets and small compensated magnetization akin to antiferromagnets. These features make them promising candidates for applications in spintronics devices. Among candidate materials, CrSb is promising because of its high ordering temperature (~705 K) and large spin-splitting energy; however, it is predicted that tuning the Néel vector requires additional symmetry breaking or a change in the easy magnetization axis. While applying epitaxial strain can modulate the symmetry, the selection of substrates with closely matched lattice constants for heteroepitaxial growth is limited for altermagnets, which generally have low crystal symmetry. Therefore, exploring the heteroepitaxial growth of altermagnet thin films on well-established, dissimilar crystal systems is valuable. (001)-oriented III-V semiconductors, which share group-V elements with the overgrown CrSb, offer an ideal platform because they are expected to have material compatibility with stable interfaces, as well as tunability of the buffer layer's bandgap and lattice constant by varying the atomic composition of their group-III and group-V atoms. In this study, we have achieved the molecular beam epitaxial growth of a CrSb ($\bar{1}10$) thin film on a GaAs (001) substrate by inserting thin FeSb ($\bar{1}10$) / AlAs (001) buffer layers. The in-plane epitaxial relationship is found to be CrSb [110] $\|$ GaAs [110] and CrSb [001] $\|$ GaAs [$\bar{1}10$], and epitaxial strain is also confirmed. We also characterized the magneto-transport properties of the grown CrSb thin film. Although the obtained conductivity tensors are mainly explained by a two-carrier model, not by an anomalous Hall effect, this model reveals the presence of high-mobility electron and hole carriers.</p>

By modeling heterostructures with van der Waals (vdW) substrates, we demonstrate that non-magnetic substrates such as h-BN preserve the QAH phase with a Chern number C = 1, maintaining gapless chiral edge states. In contrast, ferromagnetic substrates induce extra electrons, destroying the topological order by shifting the Fermi level. These findings establish substrate engineering as a pivotal strategy for experimental realization of dissipationless edge transport in V2O3-based vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications as low-power topological electronics.</p>

            <p>We study diffusion-controlled processes in nonequilibrium steady states, where standard rate theory assumptions break down. Using transition path theory, we generalize the relations between reactive probability fluxes and measures of the rate of the reaction. Stochastic thermodynamics analysis reveals how work constrains the enhancement of rates relative to their equilibrium values. An analytically solvable ion pairing model under a strong electric field illustrates and validates our approach and theory.

            <p>In the recent submission arXiv:2403.01974, Altshuler et al suggested a new approach to the Anderson transition in high dimensions. The main idea consists in the use of the branching graphs instead of high-dimensional lattices: it does not look very convincing, but we do not want to stress this point. Since the authors welcome comments, we put forward a lot of objections to their exposition of the general situation. The arising hypothesis is given in the end.</p>

            <h2>Markovian dissipation can stabilize a (localization) quantum phase transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naushad A. Kamar, Mostafa Ali, Mohammad Maghrebi</p>
            <p>Quantum phase transitions are a cornerstone of many-body physics at low temperatures but have remained elusive far from equilibrium. Driven open quantum systems -- a prominent non-equilibrium platform where coherent dynamics competes with Markovian dissipation from the environment -- often exhibit an effective classical behavior. In this work, we present a nontrivial quantum phase transition that is stabilized, rather than destroyed, by Markovian dissipation. We consider a variant of the paradigmatic spin-boson model where the spin is driven and bosons are subject to Markovian loss proportional to frequency (hence, vanishing at low frequencies). We show that the steady state exhibits a localization phase transition where the spin's dynamics is frozen, to be contrasted with the ground-state transition in the absence of dissipation. Furthermore, this transition occurs when the steady state becomes pure. The latter is not simply a dark state of dissipation but rather emerges from a nontrivial renormalization of the spin dynamics by low-frequency bosonic modes. Our work provides a nontrivial example where quantumness, typically reserved for ground states, also emerges in dynamical settings, with potential applications in quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Coherence time is the property of a quantum system that determines how long a state can hold quantum information. This parameter is directly bound to their lifetime in solid-state systems, where quantum information could be stored in quasiparticles. For decades, quasiparticles associated with magnetization order disturbance - magnons, had reported lifetimes below one microsecond at gigahertz frequencies, restricting their use as a quantum information carrier. Here, we report on the observation of short-wavelength magnons with lifetimes exceeding 18{\mu}s at millikelvin temperatures. The experiment has been performed in an ultra-pure single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet sphere in a wide range of temperatures from ambient down to 30 mK. Our results open doors for using magnons as data carriers in modern solid-state quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <h2>Molecular anyons in fractional quantum Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mytraya Gattu, J. K. Jain</p>
            <p>One of the profound consequences of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect is the notion of fractionally charged anyons. In spite of extensive experimental study, puzzles remain, however. For example, both shot-noise and Aharonov-Bohm interference measurements sometimes report a charge that is a multiple of the elementary charge. We report here high-precision microscopic calculations that reveal the surprising result that the FQH anyons often bind together into stable clusters, which we term molecular anyons. This is counterintuitive, given that the elementary anyons carry the same charge and are therefore expected to repel one another. The number of anyons in a cluster, its binding energy and its size depend sensitively on the parent FQH state and the interaction between electrons (which is experimentally tunable, e.g., by varying the quantum well width). Our calculations further suggest that the charge-$1/4$ non-Abelian anyons of the $5/2$ FQH state may also bind to form charge-$1/2$ Abelian clusters. The existence of molecular anyons not only can provide a natural explanation for the observed charges, but also leads to a host of new predictions for future experiments and invites a re-analysis of many past ones.</p>

Using results from neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements with ab inito theory and symmetry analysis, we determine how the field tunes the magnetic symmetry within individual magnetic domains and examine the resulting changes to the topological surface states and hinge states existing on edges shared by certain surfaces hosting gapped Dirac states. We predict field-tunable complex and domain-specific hinge-state patterns, with some crystal surfaces undergoing a field-induced topological phase transition. We further find that domain walls have pinned hinge states when intersecting certain crystal surfaces, providing another channel for tuning the chiral-charge-transport pathways.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Stability and Linearly Polarized Emission from CsPbI3 Perovskite Nanoplatelets through A-site Cation Engineering</h2>

            <p>The anisotropy of perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) opens up many opportunities in optoelectronics, including enabling the emission of linearly polarized light. But the limited stability of PeNPLs is a pressing challenge, especially for red-emitting CsPbI3. Herein, we address this limitation by alloying FA into the perovskite cuboctahedral site. Unlike Cs/FA alloying in bulk thin films or nonconfined nanocubes, FA incorporation in nanoplatelets requires meticulous control over the reaction conditions, given that nanoplatelets are obtained in kinetically-driven growth regimes instead of thermodynamically-driven conditions. Through in-situ photoluminescence (PL) measurements, we find that excess FA leads to uncontrolled growth, where phase-impurities and nanoplatelets of multiple thicknesses co-exist. Restricting the FA content to up to 25% Cs substitution enables monodisperse PeNPLs, and increases the PL quantum yield (from 53% to 61%), exciton lifetime (from 18 ns to 27 ns), and stability in ambient air (from ~2 days to >7 days) compared to CsPbI3. This arises due to hydrogen bonding between FA and the oleate and oleylammonium ligands, anchoring them to the surface to improve optoelectronic properties and stability. The reduction in non-radiative recombination, improvement in the nanoplatelet aspect ratio, and higher ligand density lead to FA-containing PeNPLs more effectively forming edge-up superlattices, enhancing the PL degree of linear polarization from 5.1% (CsPbI3) to 9.4% (Cs0.75FA0.25PbI3). These fundamental insights show how the stability limitations of PeNPLs could be addressed, and these materials grown more precisely to improve their performance as polarized light emitters, critical for utilizing them in next-generation display, bioimaging and communications applications.</p>

            <p>The development of deterministic single photon sources emitting in the telecommunication bands is a key challenge for quantum communication and photonic quantum computing. Here, we investigate the optical properties and single-photon emission of molecular beam epitaxy grown semiconductor quantum dots emitting in the telecom O- and C- bands. The quantum dots are embedded in a InGaAs matrix with fixed indium content grown on top of a compositionally graded InGaAs buffer. This structure allows for the future implementation of electrically contacted nanocavities to enable high-quality and bright QD emission. In detailed optical characterizations we observe linewidths as low as $ 50 \mu$eV, close to the spectrometer resolution limit, low fine structure splittings close to $ 10 \mu$eV, and $g^{(2)} (0)$ values as low as $0.08$. These results advance the current performance metrics for MBE-grown quantum dots on GaAs substrates emitting in the telecom bands and showcase the potential of the presented heterostructures for further integration into photonic devices.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the spontaneous formation of a vortex lattice in two-dimensional valley polarized superconductors due to orbital magnetization. The screening of magnetic field is weak for two-dimension superconductors, allowing for the magnetic flux associated with vortices to penetrate deep into the superconducting region. The Zeeman coupling between orbital magnetization and magnetic fields associated with vortices leads to the formation of a vortex lattice, once the vortex self-energy is lower than the Zeeman energy. We study the phase diagram and the vortex lattice configuration, and discuss the consequences of the vortex lattice formation in various experimental setups.</p>

Additionally, GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) calculations, complemented by metaGGA-based modified BSE, reveal that the Ta2Ni3Te5 monolayer is an excitonic insulator, with an exciton binding energy exceeding its band gap. These diverse properties position Ta2Ni3Te5 nanoribbons and monolayers as promising candidates for nanoelectronics, spintronics, and optoelectronics, motivating further experimental exploration.</p>

            <h2>Probing disorder-induced Fisher information matrix and Cramér-Rao bound by STM</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas A. Oliveira, Wei Chen</p>
            <p>The electronic local density of states of solids, if normalized correctly, represents the probability density that the electron at a specific position has a particular energy. Because this probability density can vary in space in disordered systems, we propose that one can either treat the energy as a random variable and position as an external parameter to construct a real space Fisher information matrix, or treat the position as a random variable and energy as an external parameter to construct an energy space Fisher information, both quantify the variation of local density of states caused by the disorder. The corresponding Cramér-Rao bounds in these two scenarios set a limit on the energy variance and the position variance of electrons, respectively, pointing to new interpretations of STM measurements. Our formalism thus bring the notion of information geometry into STM measurements, as demonstrated explicitly by lattice models of metals and topological insulators.</p>

            <h2>Multiple-Nanowire Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices: Critical Currents, Symmetries, and Vorticity Stability Regions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cliff Sun, Alexey Bezryadin</p>
            <p>An ordinary superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) contains two weak links connected in parallel. We model a multiple-wire SQUID (MW-SQUID), generalized in two ways. First, the number of weak links, which are provided by parallel superconducting nanowires, is larger than two. Second, the current-phase relationship of each nanowire is assumed linear, which is typical for a homogeneous superconducting thin wire. For such MW-SQUIDs, our model predicts that the critical current ($I_c$) is a multi-valued function of the magnetic field. We also calculate vorticity stability regions (VSR), i.e., regions in the current-magnetic field plane in which, for a given distribution of vortices, the currents in all wires are below their critical values, so the vortices do not move between the cells. The VSRs have rhombic shapes in the case of two-wire SQUIDS and have more complicated shapes in the case of many nanowires. We present a classification of such VSRs and determine conditions under which VSR is disjoint, leading to 100\% supercurrent modulation and quantum phase transitions. According to the model, the maximum critical current curves obey $IB$ symmetry, while each VSR obeys $IBV$ symmetry. The model predicts conditions at which MW-SQUID exhibits a perfect diode effect in which the critical current of one polarity is zero while it is not zero for the opposite polarity of the bias current. We also provide a classification of the stability regions produced by (1) completely symmetric, (2) phase disordered, (3) position disordered, (4) critical current disordered, and (5) completely disordered multi-wire SQUIDs.</p>

            <p>Optical chaotic comb, possessing the key metrics of intrinsic random amplitude, phase, and frequency modulation of comb lines, emerges as a novel chaotic source in information systems for coherence tomography, parallel ranging, and secure communications. Considering the analogies between magnons and photons, the magnonic analog of optical chaotic combs is expected but not yet explored. Here, we propose a scenario of generating magnonic chaotic combs based on mode coupling mechanism in magnonic systems. Especially, we theoretically demonstrate the realization of magnonic frequency combs through three-wave mixing between ultra-strongly coupled magnons in silicon based synthetic antiferromagnet platform. It is found that the realized magnonic frequency combs can transition to chaos via various routes, i.e., subcritical Hopf bifurcation, torus-doubling bifurcation, and torus breakdown. The robustness of magnonic chaotic combs is verified by characterizing the Poincare map, the bifurcation diagrams, and the largest Lyapunov exponents. Furthermore, the unique characters of chaotic combs, perturbation hypersensitivity and noise immunity, are conceptually validated by identifying latent magnetic signal contaminated by inherent noise. Our findings provide a magnonic paradigm of chaotic dynamics in complex systems for potential applications in CMOS-integrated metrology, sensing, and communication.</p>

            <p>We investigate spin-flip excitations in the spin-1/2 trimer chain $\rm{Cu_3(P_2O_6OH)_2}$, featuring an antiferromagnetic exchange motif $J_1$-$J_1$-$J_2$ with $J_1 < J_2$. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate that single-spin-flip processes induced by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) generate emergent gapless modes governed by the underlying trimer periodicity alongside distinct high-energy excitations. By combining exact diagonalization and real-space renormalization group (RG) techniques, we attribute these features to fractionalized spinons and composite quasiparticles arising from one- and two-trimer excitations. Furthermore, we show that multi-spin RIXS excitations yield experimentally distinguishable spectral signatures of composite modes absent in single-spin-flip spectra. At the field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau, single-spin-flip RIXS spectra evolves with the magnetic field to favor spin-polarized composite quasiparticles. This trend culminates in a gapless spectrum of spin-1 excitations beyond the plateau, paving the way for field-tuned Bose condensation of composite modes.</p>

Calculating the ground-state wavefunction self-consistently, we show that the mean-field Hamiltonian fulfills the requirements for a CSL ground state, resulting from a projected symmetry group classification and verify the expected twofold topological degeneracy on a torus. Furthermore we find very good overlap with the ground-state wavefunctions obtained by exact diagonalization of the original Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Realizing Kitaev interactions on triangular lattices offers a compelling platform for exploring quantum-spin-liquid physics beyond the conventional honeycomb lattice framework. Here, we investigate the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet KCeSe2, where multiple probes reveal strong magnetic anisotropy suggesting significant Kitaev physics. Through detailed and combined analysis of magnetization, neutron scattering, and thermodynamic experiments, we identify dominant ferromagnetic Kitaev ($K = -1.82$ K) and antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ($J = 1.34$ K) interactions that stabilize a stripe-$yz$ ordered ground state via an order-by-disorder mechanism. Magnetic fields applied along the Kitaev bond direction induce two phase transitions at 1.67 T and 3.8 T, consistent with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations predictions of a progression from stripe-$yz$ to stripe-canted and spin-polarized phases. Near the 1.67 T quantum critical point, enhanced quantum fluctuations suggest conditions favorable for exotic excitations.

            <p>Momentum-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy (MRSTEM) is a powerful phase-contrast technique that can map lateral magnetic and electric fields ranging from the micrometer to the subatomic scale. Resolving fields ranging from a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers, as well as across material junctions, is particularly important since these fields often determine the functional properties of devices. However, it is also challenging since they are orders of magnitude smaller than atomic electric fields. Thus, subtle changes in diffraction conditions lead to significant changes in the measured MRSTEM signal. One established approach to partially overcome this problem is precession electron diffraction, in which the incident electron beam is continuously precessed while precession-averaged diffraction patterns are acquired. Here, we present an alternative approach in which we sequentially tilt the incident electron beam and record a full diffraction pattern for each tilt and spatial position. This approach requires no hardware modification of the instrument and enables the use of arbitrary beam tilt patterns that can be optimized for specific applications. Furthermore, recording diffraction patterns for every beam tilt allows access to additional information. In this work, we use this information to create virtual large-angle convergent beam electron diffraction (vLACBED) patterns to assess MRSTEM data quality and improve field measurements by applying different data analysis methods beyond simple averaging. The presented data acquisition concept can readily be applied to other 4D-STEM applications.</p>

            <p>We study X-ray diffraction in smectic liquid crystal multilayers. Such systems are fabricated as freely suspended films and have a unique layered structure. As such, they can be described as organic Bragg mirrors with sub-nanometer roughness. However, an interesting peculiarity arises in the diffraction on these structures: the characteristic shape of diffraction peaks associated with dynamical scattering effects is not observed. Instead, the diffraction can be well described kinematically, which is atypical for Bragg mirrors. In this article we investigate the transition between the kinematical and dynamical regimes of diffraction. For this purpose, we analyze the reflection of synchrotron radiation on a real liquid crystal sample with both kinematical and dynamical theories. Furthermore, based on these theories, we derive a quantitative criterion for the transition from the kinematical to the dynamical regime. This, in turn, allows us to explain the peculiar diffraction behavior in smectic films with thicknesses exceeding thousands of molecular layers.</p>

            <p>Layered hybrid perovskites containing larger organic cations have demonstrated superior environmental stability, but the presence of these insulating spacers also strengthens the exciton binding energy, which contributes to reduced carrier separation. The consequences of increased binding energy on device efficiency are still not fully documented, and binding energy measurements are often conducted at cryogenic temperatures where linewidths are decreased and a series of hydrogen-like bound states can be identified, but not under ambient conditions where devices are expected to operate. In contrast to the quenching observed in 3D perovskites such as methylammonium lead iodide, where exciton binding energies are thought to decrease at higher temperatures, we present evidence for a smaller excitonic radius at higher temperatures in the $n=5$ member of butylammonium-spaced methylammonium lead iodide, (BA)$_2$(MA)$_{n-1}$Pb$_n$I$_{3n+1}$. We measured the temperature-dependent diamagnetic shift coefficient in magnetic fields up to 40\,T, which is one-third as large at room temperature as those at cryogenic temperatures. In both the ideal 2D and 3D hydrogen models, this trend would indicate that the exciton binding energy more than triples at room temperature.</p>

            <p>Tuning the interface properties of multiphase models is of paramount importance to the final goal of achieving a one-to-one matching with nucleation and cavitation experiments. The surface tension, at the leading order, and the Tolman length, at higher order, play a crucial role in the estimation of the free-energy barrier determining the experimentally observed nucleation rates. The lattice Boltzmann method allows for a computationally efficient modelling approach of multiphase flows, however, tuning results are concerned with the surface tension and neglect the Tolman length. We present a novel perspective that leverages all the degrees of freedom hidden in the forcing stencil of the Shan-Chen multiphase model. By means of the lattice pressure tensor we determine and tune the coefficients of higher-order derivative terms related to surface tension and Tolman length at constant interface width and density ratio. We test the method by means of both hydrostatic and dynamic simulations and demonstrate the dependence of homogeneous nucleation rates on the value of the Tolman length. This work provides a new tool that can be integrated with previously existing strategies thus marking a step forwards to a high-fidelity modelling of phase-changing fluid dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Shot noise from which-path detection in a chiral Majorana interferometer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C.W.J.Beenakker</p>
            <p>We calculate the full counting statistics of charge transfer in a chiral Majorana interferometer - a setup where a Dirac mode (an electron-hole mode) is split into two Majorana modes that encircle a number of h/2e vortices in a topological superconductor. Without any coupling to the environment it is known that the low-energy charge transfer is deterministic: An electron is transferred either as an electron or as a hole, dependent on the parity of the vortex number. We show that a stochastic contribution appears if which-path information leaks into the environment, producing the shot noise of random 2e charge transfers with binomial statistics. The Fano factor (dimensionless ratio of shot noise power and conductance) increases without bound as the which-path detection probability tends to unity.</p>

            <p>Theoretical descriptions of the stepping-stone model, a cornerstone of spatial population genetics, have long overlooked diffusive noise arising from migration dynamics. We derive an exact fluctuating hydrodynamic description of this model from microscopic rules, which we then use to demonstrate that diffusive noise significantly alters early-time genetic demixing, which we characterize through heterozygosity, a key measure of diversity. Combining macroscopic fluctuation theory and microscopic simulations, we demonstrate that the scaling of density fluctuations in a spatial domain displays an early-time behaviour dominated by diffusive noise. Our exact results underscore the need for additional terms in existing continuum theories and highlight the necessity of including diffusive noise in models of spatially structured populations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ojasvi Sharma, Sandipan Manna, Prashant Shekhar Rao, G J Sreejith</p>
            <p>We estimate the ground state of the square lattice Quantum Dimer Model in a $\rm{p4m}$-symmetric Group Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) representation and show that results in agreement with exact diagonalization (ED) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can be obtained with a $\mathcal{L}=2$ layer network. In systems of linear size $L=8$ with Hilbert space dimension $3.1\times 10^8$, GCNN shows fidelity as high as $0.99999$ with ED. For $12\leq L\leq 32$, we find excellent agreement with QMC estimates of energy, order parameters and correlation functions. The network is optimized by minimizing the energy estimated from a Metropolis algorithm assisted by a directed loop sampler. We analyze the quantum geometric tensor at the minima for $\mathcal{L}=1,2$ and $3$ and show that the empirical quantum dimension saturates with increasing network complexity due to Metropolis sampling constraints.</p>

            <h2>Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Pütz, Romain Vasseur, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei Tsypilnikov, Matheus Fibger, Fernando Iemini</p>
            <p>We discuss the behavior of general Floquet Time Crystals (FTCs), including prethermal ones, in closed systems acting as AC sensors. We provide an analytical treatment of their quantum Fisher information (QFI) dynamics, which characterizes the ultimate sensor accuracy. By tuning the direction and frequency of the AC field, we show how to resonantly induce transitions between macroscopic paired cat states in the FTC sensor, allowing a robust Heisenberg scaling precision (QFI $\sim N^2 t^2$) for exponentially long times in the system size. The QFI dynamics exhibit, moreover, a characteristic step-like structure in time due to the eventual dephasing along the cat subspaces. The behavior is discussed for different relevant initial preparations of the sensor, including ground states, low and high correlated states. Furthermore, we examine the performance of the sensor along the FTC phase transition, with the QFI capturing its critical exponents. We present our findings for both linear and nonlinear response regimes, and illustrate them for a specific FTC based on the long-range interacting LMG model.</p>

            <h2>Interpretable Scaling Behavior in Sparse Subnetwork Representations of Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon Barton, Juan Carrasquilla, Christopher Roth, Agnes Valenti</p>
            <p>The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits that within overparametrized neural networks, there exist sparse subnetworks that are capable of matching the performance of the original model when trained in isolation from the original initialization. We extend this hypothesis to the unsupervised task of approximating the ground state of quantum many-body Hamiltonians, a problem equivalent to finding a neural-network compression of the lowest-lying eigenvector of an exponentially large matrix. Focusing on two representative quantum Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and the toric code (TC), we demonstrate that sparse neural networks can reach accuracies comparable to their dense counterparts, even when pruned by more than an order of magnitude in parameter count. Crucially, and unlike the original LTH, we find that performance depends only on the structure of the sparse subnetwork, not on the specific initialization, when trained in isolation. Moreover, we identify universal scaling behavior that persists across network sizes and physical models, where the boundaries of scaling regions are determined by the underlying Hamiltonian. At the onset of high-error scaling, we observe signatures of a sparsity-induced quantum phase transition that is first-order in shallow networks. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning enhances interpretability by linking the structure of sparse subnetworks to the underlying physics of the Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Hahn, S. A. Parameswaran, Benedikt Placke</p>
            <p>Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta}\propto e^{-\beta H}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers. Although solved {in principle} by recent constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that provably have $\rho_{\beta}$ as a steady state [C.-F. Chen {\it et al}, arXiv:2311.09207] -- their implementation requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging {in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices. Here, we propose a scheme for approximately preparing quantum thermal states that only requires the [repeated] implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous performance guarantees independent of detailed physical knowledge of $H$ beyond its locality.</p>

            <h2>On the generic increase of entropy in isolated systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Huang, Qing-yu Cai</p>
            <p>This study establishes a universal mechanism for entropy production in isolated quantum systems governed by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). By developing a resolvent-based framework, we demonstrate that steady-state entropy generically arises from many-body interactions, independent of specific coupling details. Analytical arguments reveal that entropy generation is driven by two universal pathways: interaction-induced energy broadening and temporal coarse-graining over exponentially small energy gaps. Numerical simulations of nonintegrable Ising spin chains confirm logarithmic entropy scaling, consistent with predictions derived from ETH-governed eigenstate mixing. The derived self-consistent equations for energy shift and broadening parameters agree closely with numerical results. These results unify observational entropy concepts with von Neumann entropy dynamics, providing predictive tools for thermodynamic behavior in quantum many-body systems. Our findings resolve longstanding debates about interaction-dependent entropy scaling and offer pathways for entropy control in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raúl Hidalgo-Sacoto, Thomas Busch, D. Blume</p>
            <p>While elementary particles obey either bosonic or fermionic exchange statistics, generalized exchange statistics that interpolate between bosons and fermions -- applicable to quasi-particles -- constitute an intriguing topic, both from the fundamental and practical points of view. This work develops a scattering framework for two identical 1D bosonic anyons and two identical 1D fermionic anyons with zero-range contact interactions. The two-body system with zero-range interactions, both in free space and under external confinement, is used to illustrate the recently proposed bosonic-anyon -- fermionic-anyon mapping~(R. Hidalgo-Sacoto {\em{et al.}}, arXiv:2505.17669), which connects the eigenstates of bosonic anyons to those of fermionic anyons and vice versa. Performing explicit calculations for two-particle systems, the momentum distributions and the off-diagonal correlations of the single-particle density matrix for bosonic anyons and fermionic anyons are confirmed to be distinct. We also confirm the previously derived asymptotic coefficients of the momentum distribution tail at orders $k^{-2}$ and $k^{-3}$ for two harmonically confined anyons. Non-universal contributions at order $k^{-4}$ are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacek Miȩkisz, Javad Mohamadichamgavi</p>
            <p>We examine the impact of the maintenance cost of social links on cooperative behavior in the Prisoner's Dilemma game on the Barabási-Albert scale-free network with a pairwise stochastic imitation. We show by means of Monte Carlo simulations and pair approximation that the cooperation frequency changes abruptly from an almost full cooperation to a much smaller value when we increase the cost of maintaining links. In the critical region, the stationary distribution is bi-modal and the system oscillates between two states: the state with almost full cooperation and one with coexisting strategies. We show that the critical region shrinks with the increasing size of the population. However, the expected time the system spends in a metastable state before switching to the other one does not change as a function of the system's size, which precludes the existence of two stationary states in the thermodynamic limit of the infinite population.</p>

            <p>Many biological systems perform close to their physical limits, but promoting this optimality to a general principle seems to require implausibly fine tuning of parameters. Using examples from a wide range of systems, we show that this intuition is wrong. Near an optimum, functional performance depends on parameters in a "sloppy'' way, with some combinations of parameters being only weakly constrained. Absent any other constraints, this predicts that we should observe widely varying parameters, and we make this precise: the entropy in parameter space can be extensive even if performance on average is very close to optimal. This removes a major objection to optimization as a general principle, and rationalizes the observed variability.</p>

            <p>We investigate a nonequilibrium donor-acceptor quantum rectifier system coupled to an anharmonic vibrational mode, treating the vibrational dynamics both as a two-level system and as multilevel system. The time-dependent Fischer information is then calculated by deriving a quantum master equation for the reduced system dynamics. We estimate some key rectifier parameters, the donor energy, the acceptor energy, and the vibrational frequency. We report that there is an optimal time for estimating the donor and acceptor energy. However, the anharmonic mode can be estimated better only in the steadystate. The acceptor energy is found to be most precisely estimable, especially under strong coupling and high bias. Donor energy shows limited sensitivity, while vibrational frequency estimation benefits from low temperatures. This work offers a theoretical foundation for enhancing parameter estimation in nanoscale quantum devices, guiding future sensing and metrological applications in quantronic systems.</p>

We also show that the inequalities between total entropy production and marginal entropy production holds for a definition but doesn't for another definition. Furthermore, we verify that fact by calculating entropy productions for Gaussian process and numerically show the result.

Here, we demonstrate an experimental pathway to detect an interfacial exchange field between insulating ferromagnet EuS and non-magnetic Cu using magnetoresistance measurements, and show that the spin-dependent scattering at the common interface can lead to a significant current-in-plane magnetoresistance in Py$|$Cu$|$EuS trilayer Hall-bar device. Our experiment suggests that simple magnetoresistance measurements can be used to experimentally detect the interfacial exchange field and thereby the magnetic state of a ferromagnetic insulator.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiro Fujii, Anh Khoa Augustin Lu, Koji Shimizu, Satoshi Watanabe</p>
            <p>Materials design aims to discover novel compounds with desired properties. However, prevailing strategies face critical trade-offs. Conventional element-substitution approaches readily and adaptively incorporate various domain knowledge but remain confined to a narrow search space. In contrast, deep generative models efficiently explore vast compositional landscapes, yet they struggle to flexibly integrate domain knowledge. To address these trade-offs, we propose a gradient-based material design framework that combines these strengths, offering both efficiency and adaptability. In our method, chemical compositions are optimised to achieve target properties by using property prediction models and their gradients. In order to seamlessly enforce diverse constraints, including those reflecting domain insights such as oxidation states, discretised compositional ratios, types of elements, and their abundance, we apply masks and employ a special loss function, namely the integer loss. Furthermore, we initialise the optimisation using promising candidates from existing dataset, effectively guiding the search away from unfavourable regions and thus helping to avoid poor solutions. Our approach demonstrates a more efficient exploration of superconductor candidates, uncovering candidate materials with higher critical temperature than conventional element-substitution and generative models. Importantly, it could propose new compositions beyond those found in existing databases, including new hydride superconductors absent from the training dataset but which share compositional similarities with materials found in literature. This synergy of domain knowledge and machine-learning-based scalability provides a robust foundation for rapid, adaptive, and comprehensive materials design for superconductors and beyond.</p>

We find that this system can generate frequency-entangled photon pairs in the left and right transmission lines, specifically a superposition of two photon wave packets at different frequencies. The frequency entanglement of the two photons arises from the particle-hole coherent superposition (i.e., Andreev bound states) involving the delocalized entangled spin singlet. We also estimate a lower bound for the efficiency of entangled photon-pair generation, accounting for the presence of nonradiative processes such as phonon emissions. Our proposal is realistic and achievable with state-of-the-art techniques in quantum microwave engineering with electostatically defined semiconducting quantum dots.</p>

The networks were created via end-linking reactions of star polymers dispersed in a simulation box with a fixed monomer density $\rho=8$. The resultant networks were alternatively subjected to energy minimization and uniaxial stretch until the break. The stretch at the break, $\lambda_b$, depended on the strand molecular weight $N_s=2N_a+1$ with a power-law manner described as $\lambda_b \sim N_s^0.67$, consistent with the experiment. However, the strand length before stretch is proportional to $N_s^0.5$, which does not explain the observed N_s-dependence of $\lambda_b$. The analysis based on the non-affine deformation theory does not interpret the phenomenon either. Instead, the increase of normalized prepolymer concentration concerning the overlapping concentration with increasing $N_s$ explains the result through a rise in the fraction of broken strands.</p>

            <p>Gradient-based methods offer a simple, efficient strategy for materials design by directly optimizing candidates using gradients from pretrained property predictors. However, their use in crystal structure optimization is hindered by two key challenges: handling non-differentiable constraints, such as charge neutrality and structural fidelity, and susceptibility to poor local minima. We revisit and extend the gradient-based methods to address these issues. We propose Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which integrates oxidation-number masks and template-based initialization to enforce non-differentiable constraints, avoid poor local minima, and flexibly incorporate additional constraints without retraining. SMOACS enables multi-property optimization. including exceptional targets such as high-temperature superconductivity, and scales to large crystal systems, both persistent challenges for generative models, even those enhanced with gradient-based guidance from property predictors. In experiments on five target properties and three datasets, SMOACS outperforms generative models and Bayesian optimization methods, successfully designing 135-atom perovskite structures that satisfy multiple property targets and constraints, a task at which the other methods fail entirely.</p>

This system is constructed by stacking two-dimensional Chern insulators and hosts Weyl-like points defined in the parameter space $(k_x, k_y, z)$, distinct from conventional Weyl points in momentum space $(k_x, k_y, k_z)$. The Weyl-semimetal-like phase exhibits characteristics akin to those of Weyl semimetals, including linear dispersion near the Weyl-like points, nontrivial bulk topology, and the presence of Fermi arcs connecting the Weyl-like points. Unlike traditional Weyl semimetals, these features manifest in real space rather than momentum space. Furthermore, we calculate the local density of states, the layer Hall conductance, and the total 3D Hall conductivity, demonstrating that the Weyl-semimetal-like phase remains stable under weak and moderate interlayer couplings. Finally, we compute the Floquet Chern number and show that the positions of the Weyl-like points can be tuned via high-frequency laser pumping.</p>

Our results demonstrate that non-reciprocity is not essential for achieving long-range order at low temperatures.

            <p>In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, niobium nitride (NbN) superconductors have emerged as integral components due to their unique structural properties, including a high superconducting transition temperature (Tc), exceptional electrical conductivity, and compatibility with advanced device architectures. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature annealing and high-dose gamma irradiation on the structural and superconducting properties of NbN films grown on GaN via reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited cubic {\delta}-NbN (111) films exhibited a high-intensity XRD peak, high Tc of 12.82K, and an atomically flat surface. Annealing at 500 and 950 °C for varying durations revealed notable structural and surface changes. High-resolution STEM indicated improved local ordering, while AFM showed reduced surface roughness after annealing. XPS revealed a gradual increase in the Nb/N ratio with higher annealing temperatures and durations. High-resolution XRD and STEM analyses showed lattice constant modifications in {\delta}-NbN films, attributed to residual stress changes following annealing. Additionally, XRD phi-scans revealed sixfold symmetry in NbN films due to rotational domains relative to GaN. While Tc remained stable after annealing at 500 °C, increasing the annealing temperature to 950 °C degraded Tc to ~8K and reduced the residual resistivity ratio from 0.85 in as-deposited films to 0.29 after 30 minutes. The effects of gamma radiation (5 Mrad (Si)) were also studied, demonstrating minimal changes to crystallinity and superconducting performance, indicating excellent radiation resilience. These findings highlight the potential of NbN superconductors for integration into advanced quantum devices and their suitability for applications in radiation-intensive environments such as space, satellites, and nuclear power plants.</p>

The conclusions are based on the symmetry prohibition on FM contribution to the diagonal superexchange between the next-nearest neighbors for a simple square CuO$_2$ layer rather than for a real CuO$_2$ layer, where diagonal AFM superexchange may be overestimated.

For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

            <h2>Charge Orders in Fully Intercalated Bilayer TaSe$_2$: Dependence on Interlayer Stacking and Intercalation Sites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhui Yan, Lingxiao Xiong, Feipeng Zheng</p>
            <p>Recent advancements have established self-intercalation as a powerful technique for manipulating quantum material properties, with precisely controllable intercalation concentrations. Given the inherently rich phase diagrams of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), studying the self-intercalated TMDCs can offer promising candidates for investigating the interplay between various orderings. This work focuses on fully intercalated bilayer TaSe$_2$ (Ta$_3$Se$_4$), which has recently been fabricated experimentally. By performing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the suppression of an intrinsic $3\times3$ charge density wave (CDW) in parent TaSe$_2$ layers, and the emergence of $2\times 2$, $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$, or the absence of a CDW in the intercalated layers, depending on the interlayer stacking orders and intercalation sites being occupied. Particularly, the $2\times 2$ CDW shows an increase in electronic states at the Fermi level compared to its non-CDW phase. This unusual behavior contrasts with that of typical CDW materials in TMDCs. Furthermore, superconductivity is preserved in these Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures, with superconducting transition temperatures comparable to or substantially smaller than those of TaSe$_2$. Spin-orbit coupling is found to enhance the density of states at Fermi levels while simultaneously reducing the electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. These two competing effects result in varying impacts on superconductivity across different Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures. Moreover, our calculations indicate that magnetic order is absent. Our study deepens the understanding of underlying physics in Ta$_3$Se$_4$, and provides experimentally feasible candidates for studying CDW, superconductivity, and their interplay.</p>

            <p>Uncovering the rules governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the membranes that define biological cells is of central importance to understanding the physics of living systems. We theoretically and computationally investigate the behavior of flexible quasispherical vesicles that exchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external reservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We show that the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving gives rise to a morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. Additionally, we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law, derived using insights from stochastic thermodynamics, that robustly describes vesicle growth dynamics even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christoph Haessig, Mehdi Habibi, Uddalok Sen</p>
            <p>Interfacial instabilities in multicomponent fluidic systems are widespread in nature and in industrial processes, yet controlling their dynamics remains a challenge. Here, we present a strategy to actively tune Marangoni-driven self-emulsification at liquid-liquid interfaces by harnessing fluid viscoelasticity. When a water-alcohol droplet spreads on an oil bath, a radial surface tension gradient induced by selective alcohol evaporation drives an interfacial instability, leading to the spontaneous formation of a dense two-dimensional array of "daughter" droplets. We demonstrate that introducing trace amounts of high-molecular-weight polymers, which introduces viscoelasticity, provides a robust means of controlling this process. Increasing viscoelasticity systematically suppresses the instability, resulting in a delayed onset of fragmentation and longer spreading fingers. By combining high-resolution experimental visualization and theoretical analysis, we uncover a quantitative relationship between the polymer concentration and the finger length prior to breakup. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing viscoelastic interfacial materials with programmable dynamic and offer new opportunities for surface-tension-mediated patterning, emulsification, and fluidic control in soft material systems.</p>

            <p>Exotic quantum Hall systems hosting counter-propagating edge states can show seemingly non-universal transport regimes, usually depending on the size of the sample. We experimentally probe transport in a quantum Hall sample engineered to host a tunable number of counter-propagating edge states. The latter are coupled by Landauer reservoirs, which force charge equilibration over a tunable effective length. We show that charge transport is determined by the balance of up- and downstream channels, with a ballistic regime emerging for unequal numbers of channels. For equal numbers, we observe a transition to a critical diffusive regime, characterized by a diverging equilibration length. Our approach allows simulating the equilibration of hole-conjugate states and other exotic quantum Hall effects with fully controlled parameters using well-understood quantum Hall states.</p>

            <p>Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modeling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this article, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT based on gradient flows, to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of many-body non-equilibrium systems.</p>

The analysis is based on an exact solution previously derived for this model in the grand canonical ensemble. At sufficiently low temperatures, the cell model exhibits multiple first-order phase transitions. By varying the cell volume and the repulsion-to-attraction ratio, we represent a quantitative comparison of the chemical potential and pressure isotherms, along with the pressure-temperature and temperature-density phase diagrams. Our results demonstrate that altering these microscopic parameters induces quantitative changes in the phase diagrams of the cell model.</p>

            <p>This work focuses on the layered perovskite Sr$_2$NbO$_4$, a 4$d$ analogue of Sr$_2$VO$_4$, which remains an unsolved puzzle with a possible intriguing hidden magnetic order. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the robust thermodynamic stability and exfoliability of Sr$_2$NbO$_4$, suggesting potential applications as a 2D material. Imperfect Fermi surface nesting indicates instabilities that may drive symmetry lowering, charge/orbital density waves, or superconductivity. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations reveal moderate mass renormalization $(m^*/m\sim1.3)$ and an itinerant character of magnetism with strong longitudinal spin fluctuations. The exchange interaction is dominated by in-plane ferromagnetic coupling with much weaker interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange.</p>

            <p>When electrons pass through chiral molecules, their transmission is strongly influenced by the orientation of their spin: molecules with opposite handedness preferentially transmit electrons with oppositely aligned spins. The underlying nature of this striking phenomenon, known as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), remains controversial: its observed strength far surpasses predictions based on the typically weak spin-orbit interaction. A significant fraction of CISS phenomena are driven by light, and thus could be controlled at the ultrafast scale, and impact chemical change following photoionization or photoexcitation. To date, most studies of spin-selective enantio-sensitive photodynamics have concentrated on the influence of the magnetic field component of light. Here, we establish dynamical and geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photo-induced dynamics that arise purely from electric dipole interactions. Using one-photon ionization as an example, we report a new effect: enantio-sensitive locking of molecular cation orientation to the spins of the photoelectron and the hole in the parent molecule. One-photon ionization is an ubiquitous process, where CISS has already been found in oriented samples. Remarkably, the new effect that we report here emerges upon photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules, establishing CISS in amorphous chiral media.</p>

            <p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) has been highly influential in explaining thermodynamic behavior of closed quantum systems. As of yet, it is unclear whether and how the ETH applies to non-Hermitian systems. Here, we introduce a framework that extends the ETH to non-Hermitian systems, within which expectation values of local operators reproduce statistical and scaling predictions known from Hermitian ETH. We illustrate the validity of the framework on non-Hermitian random-matrix and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. Further, we show numerically how the static ETH predictions become imprinted onto the dynamics of local observables. Finally, we present a prescription for observing both ETH-obeying and ETH-violating regimes in an optical-lattice experiment that implements a disordered interacting Hatano-Nelson model. Our results generalize the celebrated ETH to the non-Hermitian setting, and they show how it affects the system dynamics, and how the salient signatures can be observed in present-day cold-atom experiments.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Protocols for Continual Learning via Statistical Physics and Control Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Mori, Stefano Sarao Mannelli, Francesca Mignacco</p>
            <p>Artificial neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially, as training on new tasks degrades the performance on previously learned tasks. Recent theoretical work has addressed this issue by analysing learning curves in synthetic frameworks under predefined training protocols. However, these protocols relied on heuristics and lacked a solid theoretical foundation assessing their optimality. In this paper, we fill this gap by combining exact equations for training dynamics, derived using statistical physics techniques, with optimal control methods. We apply this approach to teacher-student models for continual learning and multi-task problems, obtaining a theory for task-selection protocols maximising performance while minimising forgetting. Our theoretical analysis offers non-trivial yet interpretable strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, shedding light on how optimal learning protocols modulate established effects, such as the influence of task similarity on forgetting. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments on real-world data.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study the bound states of interacting photons propagating in a waveguide chirally coupled to an array of atoms. We demonstrate that the bound photon pairs can concentrate at the edge of the array and link this to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike tight-binding non-Hermitian setups, the bound states in the waveguide-coupled array exhibit infinite radiative lifetimes when the array has an infinite size. However, in a finite array, non-Hermiticity and localization of bound pairs emerge due to their chiral dissociation into scattering states. Counterintuitively, when the photons are preferentially emitted to the right, the bound pairs are localized at the left edge of the array and vice versa.</p>

            <h2>Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning Force Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kreiman, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
            <p>Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs. Our code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides simultaneous measurement of homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths through quantitative lineshape analysis. However, conventional lineshape analysis methods assume Gaussian inhomogeneity, limiting its applicability to systems with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. We present a quantitative lineshape analysis method incorporating arbitrary inhomogeneity using a bivariate spectral distribution function in 2DCS simulations. An algorithm is developed to extract the homogeneous linewidth and arbitrary inhomogeneous distribution from experimentally-measured 2D spectrum. We demonstrate this framework for a quantum-well-exciton resonance with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity.

            <p>Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as the urban heat island effect and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population or area). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population counts, and street intersections from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions follow universal scaling functions. By using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we show that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. We further demonstrate that traditional models linking climate variables to the distance from the city center fail to reproduce the observed distributions unless the stochasticity of urban structure is fully considered. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modelling and urban planning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Somayajulu Dhulipala, Carlos M. Portela</p>
            <p>Additively manufactured (AM) architected materials have enabled unprecedented control over mechanical properties of engineered materials. While lattice architectures have played a key role in these advances, they suffer from stress concentrations at sharp joints and bending-dominated behavior at high relative densities, limiting their mechanical efficiency. Additionally, high-resolution AM techniques often result in low-throughput or costly fabrication, restricting manufacturing scalability of these materials. Aperiodic spinodal architected materials offer a promising alternative by leveraging low-curvature architectures that can be fabricated through techniques beyond AM. Enabled by phase separation processes, these architectures exhibit tunable mechanical properties and enhanced defect tolerance by tailoring their curvature distributions. However, the relation between curvature and their anisotropic mechanical behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the role of curvature in governing the anisotropic stiffness and strength of shell-based spinodal architected materials. We introduce geometric metrics that predict the distribution of stretching and bending energies under different loading conditions, bridging the gap between curvature in doubly curved shell-based morphologies and their mechanical anisotropy. We validate our framework through finite element simulations and microscale experiments, demonstrating its utility in designing mechanically robust spinodal architectures. This study provides fundamental insights into curvature-driven mechanics, guiding the optimization of next-generation architected materials for engineering applications.</p>

Here we study the triplon physics and the Bose-Einstein condensation in two isostructural dimerized antiferromagnets $A$Cu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ ($A$ = Hg, Cd). With the systematic measurements, we demonstrate a dimer singlet ground state in HgCu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ with a triplon gap $\sim$ 7.9 K and a triplon Bose-Einstein condensation with an antiferromagnetic order in CdCu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ below 4.4 K. We further adopt the bond-operator technique and show that the elemental replacement preserves the Hamiltonian and allows the study in a unified theoretical framework with tunable interdimer and intradimer interactions on the opposite sides of the quantum critical point. With the peculiar Cu$_2$O$_8$ dimer configuration and effective ferromagnetic interdimer interaction, $A$Cu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ is distinguished from other $S$ = 1/2 dimerized antiferromagnets. Our results represent a global understanding of the magnetic ground states as well as the magnetic transitions in the dimerized magnets of this unusual crystal structure.</p>

            <h2>Family of Multilayer Graphene Superconductors with Tunable Chirality: Momentum-Space Vortices Forged in the Berry-Ring of Fire</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adarsh S. Patri, Marcel Franz</p>
            <p>Recent experiments in rhombohedrally-stacked multilayer graphene heterostructures have reported signatures of chiral superconductivity, emerging from a spin and valley-polarized normal state with broken time-reversal symmetry and an associated anomalous Hall effect. These findings bring into focus the role of the electronic Bloch wavefunction and the quantum geometric tensor in determining the superconducting pairing channel. In this work, we examine superconducting instabilities of a model of $N$-layer rhombohedral graphene that possesses an enhanced Berry curvature distribution on an extended ring in momentum space $-$ that we dub the 'Berry-ring of fire' $-$ in the presence of an isotropic attractive interaction with a parametrically controlled spatial range. We determine that local interactions favor a $N$-fold winding in the order parameter phase for odd-$N$ layered systems, with even-$N$ layers requiring a spatially extended attraction range to achieve pairing. For generic interaction lengths, we discover a family of chiral superconductors and, remarkably, momentum-space vortices nucleated on the Berry-ring of fire. The existence of these vortices can be traced to a momentum-space flux quantization condition involving the Berry curvature, with the phase winding dictated by a combination of the Berry flux and a 'statistical flux' to enforce Fermi-Dirac statistics. Such an order parameter structure allows for the possibility of in-situ tuning between various chiral superconducting phases through changes in the electron density or the displacement field. We discuss ways in which these predictions can be experimentally tested and potentially exploited in future devices.</p>

For 7 to 11 electrons occupying the quantum dot Zero-bias anomalies characteristic for the Kondo effect are observed, but with unexpected widths. Here the quantum dot has to be described as a multi-orbital Kondo impurity with Hund's interaction. In this way this quantum dot can be seen as a model system for a Hund's coupled mixed-valence quantum impurity as appearing in Hund's metals where local ferromagnetic interactions between orbitals lead to the emergence of complex electronic states.</p>

Magnetic $2\pi$ domain walls are easily created and controlled with existing experimental techniques, thus providing a versatile platform for Majorana manipulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reuben R. W. Wang, John L. Bohn</p>
            <p>We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Miao, Linhao Li, Hosho Katsura, Masahito Yamazaki</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.</p>

            <h2>Universal principles for sudden-quench quantum Otto engines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. S. Watson, K. V. Kheruntsyan</p>
            <p>We apply a simple sudden quench approximation for the unitary work strokes of a quantum Otto engine in order to provide a general analysis of its performance, applicable to arbitrary quantum models with two-body interactions. This work extends recent results for an interaction-driven Otto cycle to generic many-body interacting quantum models, providing universal bounds on their operation efficiency. From this, we demonstrate that the net work of such an engine cycle is determined entirely by interparticle correlations. Applications are demonstrated for a handful of paradigmatic many-body quantum models, including a novel engine -- with a spin-1/2 Fermi gas with contact two-body interactions as its working medium -- in which we leverage control over spin polarization to greatly enhance its performance compared to the unpolarized case. We then extend the analysis of interaction-driven quantum Otto engine cycles to systems where control is exerted over the strength of arbitrary quantum operators that might be present in the system Hamiltonian (such as one-body, or three-body, etc.), finding that the general principles derived for the sudden quench with two-body interactions apply universally. As an example, this is demonstrated for a conventional volumetric Otto cycle, where beneficial net work is generated by leveraging the control over the frequency of an external trap, which is a one-body operator. However, we emphasize that the results derived here apply universally to all Otto engine cycles operating under a sudden quench protocol.</p>

            <h2>Effective potential and scattering length of shielding polar molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Xu, Gang Chen</p>
            <p>We investigate the effective potential and scattering length of ultracold polar molecules under different shielding techniques. First, we derive the effective potential for two polar molecules in the presence of an elliptical polarization field, combined elliptical and linear polarization fields, and combined elliptical polarization and static fields. The effective potential is then expressed as a sum of a zero-range contact interaction and a long-range dipole-dipole interaction under the Born approximation. We find that the first two shielding methods only partially suppress attractive interactions, while the second method allows for the construction of bound states with different polarization shapes. The last shielding method can achieve complete cancellation of residual attractive forces, which is particularly significant for maintaining quantum degeneracy in ultracold dipolar systems. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the effective potential and scattering length of shielding polar molecules, which is crucial for studying many-body physics in ultracold dipolar systems.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood. Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum-observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces. Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Effects at a Spin-Flop Transition in the Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</h2>

            <p>It is shown that the experimentally detected features in the low-temperature behavior of the magnetization in an external magnetic field perpendicular to the layers of manganese ions of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ are due to quantum effects induced by the off-diagonal nature of the trigonal component of the crystal field. In this case, the anomalous increase in the magnetization of the material before the spin-flop transition, as well as after it in the phase of "collapsed" sublattices, is explained by the suppression of contributions from quantum effects. The comparison of the results of the theoretical analysis with experimental data has made it possible to refine the parameters of the effective spin model of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and to establish the important role of the noted trigonal component.</p>

            <h2>Modulation of Polarization and Metallicity in Janus Sliding Ferroelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshay Mahajan, Awadhesh Narayan</p>
            <p>Sliding ferroelectricity is emerging as a distinct and promising mechanism for realizing ferroelectricity in low-dimensional systems, offering new design principles beyond the conventional ferroelectric mechanism. Further, the coexistence of the out-of-plane polarization with in-plane conductivity induced by electrostatic charge doping makes these systems strong candidates for realizing ferroelectric metals. Using density functional theory calculations, we analyze the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based Janus sliding ferroelectric bilayers XMY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, Te; X $\neq$ Y). In addition to exhibiting switchable interlayer polarization, Janus sliding ferroelectrics possess an intrinsic electric field within each monolayer, arising from the electronegativity difference between the chalcogen atoms. We discover that the intrinsic electric field of the monolayers can be used to modulate the interlayer ferroelectric polarization and the electronic band structure. We identify the decrease in the interlayer distance due to a particular stacking of the Janus bilayers as a major contributor to increasing polarization and reducing the bandgap. The direction of the intrinsic electric field within the Janus monolayers plays a significant role in the modulation of layer-wise contribution in the valence and conduction bands, which influences the polarization reduction due to extrinsic charge dopants. Extending this concept to Janus trilayers, we observe further enhancement in polarization and additional bandgap reduction compared to their bilayer counterparts. These results highlight the tunability of TMD-based Janus sliding ferroelectrics and suggest a pathway for designing low bandgap ferroelectrics and potential ferroelectric metals.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in magnon spintronics have ignited interest in the interactions between the spin and elastic subsystems of magnetic materials. These interactions suggest a dynamic connection between collective excitations of spins, quantized as magnons, and elastic waves generated by perturbations in the crystal lattice, quantized as phonons. Both magnons and their associated magnon-phonon excitations can act as sources of spin pumping from magnetic materials into non-magnetic metals. Although a considerable body of research has focused on spin pumping via elastic waves in ferromagnets, similar investigations involving antiferromagnets have yet to be undertaken. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of generating spin currents at ultrasonic frequencies of acoustic resonance in antiferromagnetic crystal hematite $\alpha-\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ at room temperature. We provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that, due to strong magnetoelastic coupling, acoustic vibrations in hematite induce significant variable deviations in magnetization, resulting in spin accumulation at the antiferromagnet-normal metal interface, which in turn leads to the generation of spin and charge currents in the metal. Charge currents arising from the inverse spin Hall effect can be measured using the same methodology employed under high-frequency spin pumping conditions at the resonances of the magnetic subsystem itself. Moreover, the acoustic resonance in hematite is significantly more pronounced (by hundreds or even thousands of times) than in other quasiferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic systems, enabling the attainment of extremely large amplitudes of magnetic oscillations for spin pumping. This research highlights the new approach of utilizing acoustic spin pumping to manipulate spin currents in magnetic materials, particularly antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir A. Zyuzin</p>
            <p>In this paper we theoretically discuss thermal Hall effect of magnons in insulating Néel ordered antiferromagnets at zero external magnetic field. We show that non-zero thermal Hall effect requires absence of any symmetry between the two sublattices. The thermal Hall effect of magnons will be non-zero by a virtue of the spin-momentum splitting of the magnon spectrum due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as well as anisotropic second-nearest exchange interaction different in the two sublattices, both corresponding to the broken symmetry. We construct a theoretical model in which an external electric field may change the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic system thus altering the thermal Hall effect of magnons.</p>

            <p>Excitation of ordered phases produces quasiparticles and collective modes, as exemplified by magnons that emerge from magnetic order, with applications in information transmission and quantum interconnects. Extending this paradigm to ferroelectric materials suggests the existence of ferrons, i.e. fundamental quanta of the collective excitation of ferroelectric order5 developed theoretically by Bauer and coworkers. While coherent magnons are observed in a broad range of experiments, coherent ferrons have eluded experimental detection. This discrepancy is particularly intriguing given that electric dipole interactions (FE) are inherently stronger than their magnetic counterparts. Here, we report the generation and transport of coherent ferrons in the van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric material NbOI2. By launching collective oscillations of the ferroelectric dipoles using a short laser pulse, we identify coherent ferrons from intense and narrow-band terahertz (THz) emission and observe their propagations along the polar direction at extremely hypersonic velocities exceeding 10^5 m/s. The THz emission is a second-order nonlinear process that requires ferroelectric order, as is confirmed in the structurally related ferroelectric WO2Br2 and non-ferroelectric TaOBr2. The discovery of coherent ferrons paves the way for numerous applications, including narrow-band THz emission, ferronic information processing, and quantum interconnects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E.P. Mattos, A. Vidiella-Barranco</p>
            <p>Quantum systems, such as a single-mode cavity field coupled to a thermal bath, typically experience destructive effects due to interactions with their noisy environment. When the bath combines both thermal fluctuations and a nonclassical feature like quadrature squeezing, forming a squeezed thermal reservoir, the system's behaviour can change substantially. In this work, we study the evolution of the cavity field in this generalized environment using an alternative phase-space approach based on the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$-function. We derive a compact analytical expression for the time-dependent $P$-function for arbitrary initial cavity field states and demonstrate its utility through specific examples. Additionally, we obtain analytical expressions, as a function of time, for some statistical properties of the cavity field, as well as for the nonclassical depth, $\tau_m$, a nonclassicality measure calculated directly from the $P$-function.</p>

While a similar analysis has been performed for the bosonic O(N) model, fermionic models pose new challenges. In this work, we systematically explore the CFT spectrum in both the large and small $q$ limits beyond the first few orders, and perform a resurgence analysis. Through this approach, we identify the exponential corrections that relate the convergent small-$q$ expansion to the asymptotic large-$q$ behavior. Our results are suggestive of a geometric interpretation of these results in terms of the worldline of particles moving along the geodesics on the cylinder.</p>

            <p>The discovery and optimization of materials for specific applications is hampered by the practically infinite number of possible elemental combinations and associated properties, also known as the `combinatorial explosion'. By nature of the problem, data are scarce and all possible data sources should be used. In addition to simulations and experimental results, the latent knowledge in scientific texts is not yet used to its full potential. We present an iterative framework that refines a given scientific corpus by strategic selection of the most diverse documents, training Word2Vec models, and monitoring the convergence of composition-property correlations in embedding space. Our approach is applied to predict high-performing materials for oxygen reduction (ORR), hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions for a large number of possible candidate compositions. Our method successfully predicts the highest performing compositions among a large pool of candidates, validated by experimental measurements of the electrocatalytic performance in the lab. This work demonstrates and validates the potential of iterative corpus refinement to accelerate materials discovery and optimization, offering a scalable and efficient tool for screening large compositional spaces where reliable data are scarce or non-existent.</p>

            <p>Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with over $50\,\mathrm{dB}$ of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency ($200\,\mathrm{MHz}$ vs. $80\,\mathrm{MHz}$) at roughly one seventh the cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Guan, Junjie Liu, Jian-Hua Jiang</p>
            <p>Multipartite quantum correlated systems (MQCSs) are widely utilized in diverse quantum information tasks, where their sophisticated control inherently incurs energetic costs. However, the fundamental characteristics of these control costs remain elusive, largely due to the lack of thermodynamic descriptions capable of capturing the full complexities of MQCSs. Here, we uncover universal thermodynamic relations for arbitrary MQCSs weakly coupled to a thermal bath, establishing an intrinsic global-local duality of control costs. Using these relations, we elucidate the exact role of multipartite correlation--a defining quantum feature of MQCSs--in shaping control costs at finite times. We also demonstrate that the relative magnitude between global and local control costs is undetermined, which perplexes the cost management of MQCSs under finite-time controls. Our results are numerically corroborated with applications to experimentally realizable multi-qubit systems undergoing finite-time qubit reset processes.</p>

            <p>In this work, we systematically investigate the spectral and transport properties of exciton-polaritons under the explicit influence of intermolecular vibrational coupling, which introduces dynamic disorder. In the context of a one-dimensional molecular chain strongly interacting with a cavity photon, we demonstrate the polaritonic characteristics of the spectral function and its interactions with the electronic band broadened by the coupling disorder. We further dissect the current flux into its bare excitonic contribution and transport via the cavity photon. Our results reveal that the enhancement in the charge carrier mobility and frequency-resolved conductivity stems from the photon-mediated current. More importantly, contrary to the intuition that dynamic disorder hinders transport, intermolecular vibrational coupling can facilitate exciton-polariton transport, offering an additional degree of tunability for material properties.</p>

            <h2>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. L. Dao</p>
            <p>In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state wavefunction for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) of up to 100 spins and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems of up 50 spins. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ & $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</p>

            <p>We realize a driven-dissipative Ising spin glass using cavity QED in a novel ``4/7" multimode geometry. Gases of ultracold atoms trapped within the cavity by optical tweezers serve as effective spins. They are coupled via randomly signed, all-to-all Ising cavity-mediated interactions. Networks of up to n = 25 spins are holographically imaged via cavity emission. The system is driven through a frustrated transverse-field Ising transition, and we show that the entropy of the spin glass states depends on the rate at which the transition is crossed. Despite being intrinsically nonequilibrium, the system exhibits phenomena associated with Parisi's theory of equilibrium spin glasses, namely replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and ultrametric structure. For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.</p>

            <p>Emergent Ising$_h^2$ integrability is anticipated in a quantum Ising ladder composed of two weakly-coupled critical transverse field Ising chains. The system is remarkable for including eight types of massive relativistic particles, with their scattering matrix and mass spectrum characterized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ Lie algebra. In this article, by computing the spin dynamical structure factors following analytical form factor approach, we clearly identify dispersive single-particle excitations of (anti-) soliton and breathers as well as their multi-particle continua in the spectra, which is further confirmed by the numerical simulations. We show that the selection rule inherent in the parity and topological charge of the theory, causes a significant result that charge-parity-odd particles, termed as dark particles, cannot be directly excited from the ground state through any local or quasi-local operations. This in turn suggests the long lifetime of the lightest dark particle.</p>

            <p>The use of pressure to obtain new materials that can be recovered under ambient conditions is a central problem in high-pressure physics. Despite decades of research, this goal has only been achieved in the laboratory for a few notable examples, such as diamond and cubic boron nitride. An area of significant interest is the transformation under compression of light-element molecular compounds to extended covalent-bonded (polymeric) solids. Among them, CO$_2$ has been extensively studied because of its status as a prototypical simple molecular system with a rich phase diagram and due to its fundamental role in Earth's physics and chemistry. One of its polymeric crystalline phases, accessible at extreme pressures and temperatures, has been recently quenched to ambient pressure, but below room temperature. Here we report ab initio calculations predicting that isothermal compression of a carbon monoxide and oxygen mixture (CO+O$_2$), rather than the compound CO$_2$, lowers the onset of C-polymerization at room temperature from ~118 GPa to ~7 GPa (complete by ~23 GPa). Moreover, it leads to the formation of an intrinsically different polymer with enhanced metastability. We predict that this dense phase is an energetic material which can potentially be recovered to ambient pressure and temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Arnob Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in exploring higher-order topology and their semi-metallic counterparts, particularly in the context of Dirac, Weyl, and nodal line semimetals, termed as higher-order Dirac semimetal (HODSM), higher-order Weyl semimetal, and higher-order nodal line semimetal (HONLSM). The HODSM phase exhibits hinge Fermi arcs (FAs) with a quantized higher-order topological invariant. Conversely, the HONLSM phase is a hybrid-order topological phase manifesting both drumhead-like surface states and hinge FAs as a signature of first- and second-order topology, and also possesses both first- and second-order topological invariants. In this work, we investigate a tight binding model for multi-HODSM (mHODSM) hosting multiple hinge FAs having a quantized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) greater than one. Furthermore, we obtain a multi-HONLSM (mHONLSM) phase from the mHODSM by applying an external magnetic field, which breaks the $PT$-symmetry. The mHONLSM phase possesses both the dipolar winding number, non-vanishing only inside the nodal loops, being the representative invariant for first-order topology, and the QWN, featuring both drumhead-like surface states and multiple hinge FAs. We study the spectral properties of the mHODSM and mHONLSM in different geometries. We also investigate the hinge FA-mediated transport in HONLSM employing a two-terminal setup.</p>

            <p>In a system of two-dimensional electrons, a combination of broken symmetry, interactions, and nontrivial topology can conspire to give rise to a nonlinear transport regime, where electric current density scales as the square of electric field. This regime has become a venue for exciting discoveries such as the nonlinear Hall effect and diode-like nonreciprocal transport. However, interpretation of experimental data is challenging in the nonlinear regime as DC transport is described by a rank-3 conductivity tensor with 6 free parameters. Here, we resolve this challenge by analytically solving for the nonlinear potential distribution across the disk sample for an arbitrary linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors. This allows us to unambiguously extract all components of the nonlinear tensor from experimental measurement. Using this novel tool, we identify giant nonlinear Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene. Our methodology provides the first systematic framework for interpreting nonlinear transport and uncovers a new route towards understanding quasi-2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhan Wang, Heng-Jia Zhang, Kun Jiang, Fu-Chun Zhang</p>
            <p>The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit formed by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction $U$ and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped due to electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to be a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The effects of Hund's coupling $J_H$ on the low-energy spectra are also studied via exact diagonalization. The proposed low-energy theory for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is found to be valid in a wide range of $U$ and $J_H$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Sturm, Raffael L. Klees, Ewelina M. Hankiewicz, Daniel Gresta</p>
            <p>We study the thermoelectrical transport transverse to conventional and topological Josephson junctions with a central quantum dot (QD). For that purpose, we derive an effective resonant tunneling model where the QD is renormalized with an induced superconducting gap. By applying the Keldysh Green's function technique, we compute the local density of states as well as the transmission functions. In the latter case, we observe that the Andreev bound states forming on the QD are inverted if the junction has $p$-wave symmetry, meaning that electron and hole orbitals switch roles. We calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients both analytically and numerically and show how the induced gaps and the band inversion are reflected in the electrical and heat conductance as well as the Seebeck coefficient, the latter experiencing a sign change in the topological case.</p>

            <h2>Bogolon-mediated electromagnetic wave absorption in multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyu Zhu, Meng Sun</p>
            <p>We investigate the electromagnetic wave absorption process in a coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate model in different dimensionality at zero temperature. As the analogue of phonon in the solid state physics, the elementary excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate is described by Bogoliubov quasiparticle or bogolon for short. Due to the small magnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the absorption process is prohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this depression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the simple Bose gas model. In this article, we develop a microscopical theory for electromagnetic wave absorption by a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the absorption rate dependence in different dimensions. Our calculation shows the possibility of manipulating the absorption property by tuning the parameters of the condensates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Pioldi, Giorgio De Simoni, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto</p>
            <p>A photonic heat amplifier (PHA) designed for cryogenic operations is introduced and analyzed. This device comprises two variable-range-hopping reservoirs connected by lossless lines, which allow them to exchange heat through photonic modes. This configuration enables negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC), which can be harnessed to amplify thermal signals. To achieve this, one reservoir is maintained at a high temperature, serving as the source terminal of a thermal transistor. Concurrently, in the other one, we establish tunnel contacts to metallic reservoirs, which function as the gate and drain terminals. With this arrangement, it is possible to control the heat flux exchange between the source and drain by adjusting the gate temperature. We present two different parameter choices that yield different performances: the first emphasizes modulating the source-drain heat current, while the second focuses on the modulation of the colder temperature variable range hopping reservoir. Lastly, we present a potential design variation in which all electronic reservoirs are thermally connected through only photonic modes, allowing interactions between distant elements. The proposal of the PHA addresses the lack of thermal transistors and amplifiers in the mK range while being compatible with the rich toolbox of circuit quantum electrodynamics. It can be adapted to various applications, including sensing and developing thermal circuits and control devices at sub-Kelvin temperatures, which are relevant to quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Over the past century, continuous advancements in electron microscopy have enabled the synthesis, control, and characterization of high-quality free-electron beams. These probes carry an evanescent electromagnetic field that can drive localized excitations and provide high-resolution information on material structures and their optical responses, currently reaching the sub-ångström and few-meV regime. Moreover, combining free electrons with pulsed light sources in ultrafast electron microscopy adds temporal resolution in the sub-femtosecond range while offering enhanced control of the electron wave function. Beyond their exceptional capabilities for time-resolved spectromicroscopy, free electrons are emerging as powerful tools in quantum nanophotonics, on par with photons in their ability to carry and transfer quantum information, create entanglement within and with a specimen, and reveal previously inaccessible details on nanoscale quantum phenomena. This Roadmap outlines the current state of this rapidly evolving field, highlights key challenges and opportunities, and discusses future directions through a collection of topical sections prepared by leading experts.</p>

            <h2>Machine-Learning Potentials Predict Orientation- and Mode-Dependent Fracture in Refractory Diborides</h2>

            <p>Fracture toughness ($K_\mathrm{Ic}$) and fracture strength ($\sigma_\mathrm{f}$) are key criteria in the selection and design of reliable ceramics. However, their experimental characterization remains challenging -- especially for ceramic thin films, where size and interfacial effects hinder accurate and reproducible measurements. Here, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained on \textit{ab initio} datasets of single crystal models deformed up to fracture are used to characterize transgranular cleavage in pre-cracked ceramic diboride TMB$_2$ (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf) lattices through stress intensity factor ($K$)-controlled loading. Mode-I simulations performed across distinct crack geometries show that fracture is primarily driven by straight crack extension along the original plane. The corresponding macroscale fracture-initiation properties ($K_\mathrm{Ic} \approx 1.7$-2.9 MPa$\cdot\sqrt{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_\mathrm{f} \approx 1.6$-2.4 GPa) are extrapolated using established scaling laws. Considering TiB$_2$ as a representative system, additional simulations explore loading conditions ranging from pure Mode-I (opening) to Mode-II (sliding). TiB$_2$ models containing prismatic cracks exhibit their lowest fracture resistance under mixed-mode conditions, where the crack deflects onto pyramidal planes--as confirmed by nanoindentation tests on TiB$_2$(0001) thin films. This study establishes $K$-controlled, MLIP-based simulations as predictive tools for orientation- and mode-dependent fracture in ceramics. The approach is readily extendable to finite temperatures for evaluating fracture behavior under conditions relevant to refractory applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akram Ibrahim, Ahmed M. Hafez, Mahmooda Sultana, Can Ataca</p>
            <p>Graphene functionalized with catalytic transition metals offers high-performance gas sensing by coupling graphene's exceptional electronic transport properties with the metal's catalytic activity, yet the atomistic relationships connecting synthesis parameters, morphological outcomes, and sensor performance remain elusive. We developed an equivariant machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) with near-DFT accuracy to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Pt crystal growth on graphene and subsequent H$_2$-sensing. MD simulations validated by TEM show that Pt deposition begins with dispersed nuclei coalescing into polycrystalline nanoclusters with predominantly FCC interiors, while both MD and Raman spectroscopy reveal a predominantly non-covalent Pt-graphene interaction that induces moderate local strain and charge transfer yet preserves graphene's structural integrity. Reactive MD simulations confirm H$_2$ dissociative chemisorption exclusively on Pt, with negligible spillover onto pristine graphene. However, H adsorption on Pt attenuates the Pt-graphene interfacial binding, providing an indirect electronic pathway for H$_2$ sensing. Transient and steady-state kinetic analyses demonstrate that an intermediate Pt loading minimizes the limit of detection; lower loadings facilitate faster response and recovery kinetics and enhance signal transduction, whereas higher loadings increase the doping level of graphene. DFT charge analysis indicates that under-coordinated Pt clusters induce $n$-type doping in graphene, whereas continuous Pt films induce $p$-type doping, with both effects attenuated upon H adsorption. The developed machine-learned MD framework enables quantum-mechanically accurate modeling of metal crystal growth on graphene, elucidates the underlying H$_2$-sensing mechanism, and correlates several key sensing figures of merit with metal loading and morphology.</p>

            <p>Tetravacancies in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with consistent edge termination (boron or nitrogen) form triangular nanopores with electrostatic potentials that can be leveraged for applications such as selective ion transport and neuromorphic computing. In order to quantitatively predict the properties of these structures, an atomic-level understanding of their local electronic and chemical environments is required. Moreover, robust methods for their precision manufacture are needed. Here were use electron irradiation in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) at high dose rate to drive the formation of boron-terminated tetravacancies in monolayer hBN. Characterization of the defects is achieved using aberration-corrected STEM, monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and electron ptychography. Z-contrast in STEM and chemical fingerprinting by core-loss EELS enable identification of the edge terminations, while electron ptychography gives insight into structural relaxation of the tetravacancies and provides evidence of enhanced electron density around the defect perimeters indicative of bonding effects.</p>

            <h2>Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Henkel</p>
            <p>A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in classical many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.</p>

            <h2>Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minjae Cho</p>
            <p>We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</p>

            <h2>Low-temperature spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix of the XXZ chain in the massless regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saskia Faulmann, Frank Göhmann, Karol K. Kozlowski</p>
            <p>The free energy per lattice site of a quantum spin chain in the thermodynamic limit is determined by a single `dominant' Eigenvalue of an associated quantum transfer matrix in the infinite Trotter number limit. For integrable quantum spin chains, related with solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, an appropriate choice of the quantum transfer matrix enables to study its spectrum, e.g.\ by means of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. In its turn, the knowledge of the full spectrum allows one to study its universality properties such as the appearance of a conformal spectrum in the low-temperature regime. More generally, accessing the full spectrum is a necessary step for deriving thermal form factor series representations of the correlation functions of local operators for the spin chain under consideration. These are statements that have been established by physicists on a heuristic level and that are calling for a rigorous mathematical justification. In this work we implement certain aspects of this programme with the example of the XXZ quantum spin chain in the antiferromagnetic massless regime and in the low-temperature limit. We rigorously establish the existence, uniqueness and characterise the form of the solutions to the non-linear integral equations that are equivalent to the Bethe Ansatz equations for the quantum transfer matrix of this model. This allows us to describe that part of the quantum transfer matrix spectrum that is related to the Bethe Ansatz and that does not collapse to zero in the infinite Trotter number limit. Within the considered part of the spectrum we rigorously identify the dominant Eigenvalue and show that those correlations lengths that diverge in the low-temperature limit are given, to the leading order, by the spectrum of the free Boson $c=1$ conformal field theory. This rigorously establishes a long-standing conjecture present in the physics literature.</p>

Reviewing the theory from [W.D.

            <p>Predicting properties of crystals from their structures is a fundamental yet challenging task in materials science. Unlike molecules, crystal structures exhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of capturing both local and global information effectively. However, most current works fall short of capturing long-range interactions within periodic structures. To address this limitation, we leverage \emph{reciprocal space} to efficiently encode long-range interactions with learnable filters within Fourier transforms. We introduce Reciprocal Geometry Network (ReGNet), a novel architecture that integrates geometric GNNs and reciprocal blocks to model short-range and long-range interactions, respectively. Experimental results on JARVIS, Materials Project, and MatBench demonstrate that ReGNet achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across a range of crystal property prediction tasks. Additionally, we explore a model extension that employs the mixture-of-experts for multi-property prediction with promising results and high computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of our model as a scalable and accurate solution for crystal property prediction. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations without quantum corrections: A coherent-incoherent correspondence approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Nishiyama, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>We introduce the coherent-incoherent correspondence as a framework for deriving quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations under continuous measurement in Lindblad dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence establishes a mapping between the original quantum system undergoing coherent evolution and its corresponding incoherent system without coherent dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence relates quantities across these two systems, including jump statistics, dynamical activity, and entropy production. Since the classical-like properties of the incoherent system allow us to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations within it, these relations can be transferred to the coherent system via the coherent-incoherent correspondence. This enables us to derive quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the original coherent system. Unlike existing quantum uncertainty relations, which typically require explicit quantum correction terms, our approach avoids these additional terms. This framework provides a general method for deriving trade-offs in quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>We investigated the origin of collective electronic phase transitions induced at the heterointerface between monoclinic insulating (MI) VO2 and rutile metallic (RM) electron-doped VO2 layers using in situ soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPES) on nanoscale VO2/V0.99W0.01O2 (001)R bilayers. Thanks to the surface sensitivity of SXPES, we determined the changes in the electronic structure and V-V dimerization in each constituent layer separately. The selective observation of the electronic and crystal structures in the upper VO2 layer of the bilayer indicates that the MI-phase VO2 layer undergoes a transition to the RM phase by forming the heterointerface. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the RM-phase VO2 undergoes a transition to the MI phase with a decrease in temperature, as in the case of a VO2 single-layer film. Furthermore, during the temperature-induced phase transition in the VO2 layer, the spectra are well described by an in-plane phase separation of the RM and MI phases. These results suggest that the interface-induced transition from the MI phase to the RM phase in the VO2 layer of bilayers occurs as a collective phase transition derived from the static energy balance between the interfacial energy and the bulk free energies of the constituent layers.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits show great promise to realize practical quantum computers from micro-fabricated integrated circuits. However, their solid-state architecture bears the burden of parasitic modes in qubit materials and the control circuitry which cause decoherence and interfere with qubits. Here, we present evidence that wirebonds, which are used to contact the micro-circuits and to realize chip-to-chip airbridges, may contain parasitic Josephson junctions. In our experiment, such a junction was enclosed in a superconducting loop and so gave rise to the formation an RF-SQUID which interfered with a nearby flux-tunable transmon qubit. Periodic signatures observed in magnetic field sweeps revealed a strong AC-dispersive coupling of the parasitic RF-SQUID to both the qubit and its readout resonator, in addition to the DC-inductive coupling between RF-SQUID and qubit. Our finding sheds light on a previously unknown origin of decoherence due to parasitic Josephson junctions in superconducing circuits.</p>

            <p>Light-induced control of quantum materials enables manipulation of electronic and structural phases on ultrafast timescales. Probing their atomic-scale dynamics is essential to understand the role of defects and domain boundaries, but conventional time-resolved techniques lack the required spatial resolution. Here, we use terahertz (THz) scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate a THz-light-induced metastable state near a defect in 1T-TaS2, and follow its photoinduced dynamics in real space and time. THz excitation induces quasi-stationary changes in the insulating gap on angstrom scales, which we associate with interlayer stacking changes. Simultaneously, THz-lightwave-driven tunneling provides access to ultrafast dynamics of the metastable state, revealing 2.5 THz oscillations of the charge density wave amplitude mode and a 1.3 THz mode attributed to an interlayer shear vibration emerging near the defect. Our results demonstrate the dual role of tip-enhanced THz fields in driving metastability and ultrafast tunneling, opening new avenues for ultrafast atomic-scale control of quantum materials.</p>

Here we report on the observation of matter wave phase doubling when bosonic atoms pair into molecules. Using matter wave diffraction, we verify spatial phase coherence and observe a two-fold increase of phase in the molecular wavefunction, confirming the matter-wave version of phase doubling. The diffraction patterns also reveal non-classical correlations indicative of entangled atom pairs formed during the reaction. Our results establish molecular matter-wave diffraction as a powerful tool to probe quantum coherence and entanglement generation in chemically reactive quantum gases.</p>

Ta (W) JJs reveal the zero-field diode efficiency of ~17 (~5)% at 2 K, slightly (much) smaller than that of the Pt JJs. Notably, the zero-field diode polarity of Ta and W JJs turns out to be opposite to the Pt JJs. Our results, along with a large zero-field diode efficiency found in highly magnetic-susceptible Pd JJs and a non-volatile anomalous phase-shift {\phi}_0 probed by superconducting quantum interferometry, demonstrate the {\phi}_0-tuning of zero-field diode performance via proximity engineering of interface magnetic ordering and Rashba effect.</p>

            <h2>Majorana Zero Mode Induced by a Screw Dislocation on the Surface of an Iron-based Superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naoki Otsuki, Yositake Takane</p>
            <p>We propose a simple scenario to describe a dislocation-induced Majorana zero mode on the surface of an iron-based superconductor, using an illustrative model with a cylindrical hole of radius $R$ perpendicular to its top surface. Topological surface states on the inner surface of the hole form an effective chiral $p$-wave superconductor. When the top surface has a perpendicular magnetization, chiral Majorana modes appear near the circular edge of the hole. Since the corresponding wavefunctions obey an antiperiodic boundary condition in the circumferential direction, a Majorana zero mode at zero energy does not appear. However, if a screw dislocation is inserted through the hole, the antiperiodic boundary condition is transformed into a periodic one, resulting in the appearance of a Majorana zero mode. This Majorana zero mode remains in the no-hole limit of $R \to 0$. We confirm this scenario by numerical simulation and effective theory. A method of creating a Majorana zero mode in the absence of the surface magnetization is briefly described.</p>

            <p>Strong electron-hole interactions in a semimetal or narrow-gap semiconductor may drive a ground state of condensed excitons. Monolayer WTe2 has been proposed as a host material for such an exciton condensate, but the order parameter - the key signature of a macroscopic quantum-coherent condensate - has not been observed. Here we use Fourier-transform scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (FT-STS) to study quasi-particle interference (QPI) and periodic modulations of the local density of states (LDOS) in monolayer WTe2. In WTe2 on graphene, in which the carrier density can be varied via back-gating, FT-STS shows QPI features in the 2D bulk bands, confirming the interacting nature of the bandgap in neutral WTe2 and the semi-metallic nature of highly n- and p-doped WTe2. We observe additional non-dispersive spatial modulations in the LDOS imprinted on the topological edge mode of neutral WTe2 on metallic substrates (graphene and graphite), which we interpret as the interaction of the topological edge mode with the expected charge density wave order parameter of the excitonic condensate in WTe2 at low interaction strength due to screening by the metallic substrates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Peng, Shibo Fang, Junwei Liu, Yee Sin Ang</p>
            <p>Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.</p>

By comparing the spin susceptibility and odd-parity multipole susceptibility in the multisublattice model, we find that the ferroic multipole fluctuation is induced by the quantum geometry of Bloch electrons over a wide range of parameters. Due to the Hubbard interaction, the quantum-geometric multipole fluctuations condense into the multipole order.

            <h2>Nonreciprocal and long-range three-body interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates induced by optical feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Qing Zhang, Liang-Jun He, Han Pu, Zheng-Wei Zhou, Yong-Chang Zhang</p>
            <p>We propose generating long-range and nonreciprocal three-body interactions in quantum gases via optical feedback. By placing a quasi-two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in front of two reflecting mirrors and illuminating it with dichromatic laser beams, these driving optical fields traverse the BEC twice, thereby inducing a feedback effect on the atoms. We demonstrate that this optical feedback gives rise to an effective three-body atom-atom interaction with remarkable long-range and nonreciprocal properties. Due to its long-range nature, this three-body interaction can cause unique spatial symmetry-breaking behaviors in the BEC, resulting in various stable stationary states as well as unexpected diffusive collapse. Notably, a distinct ring state emerges through a purely self-organizing process. Furthermore, by analyzing the real-time dynamics of the BEC, we show that the nonreciprocal nature of this interaction can lead to intriguing self-acceleration of the condensate, seemingly violating Newton's law of motion. Additionally, our scheme offers a highly controllable setting, where pairwise two-body interactions can be tuned to vanish. This flexibility provides a promising route for exploring exotic physics associated with multi-body interactions.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous supercurrents in the presence of particle losses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Risa Ogino, Shun Uchino</p>
            <p>We show that supercurrent properties in a superfluid or superconducting junction are significantly modified due to single-particle losses present in a conduction channel. In the presence of a spin-independent particle loss, we find regimes where the Josephson current $I_N(\phi)$ takes zero at a position in between $\phi= 0$ and $\phi=\pi$, and the direction of the supercurrent is reversed. Although the region is narrow, we also find a regime in which the critical current is enhanced by dissipation. Such anomalous behaviors in the Josephson current are attributed to a subtle interplay between the contribution that is present regardless of dissipation and the unconventional one that is absent without dissipation. In the presence of a spin-selective particle loss, it is shown that a dissipation-induced spin supercurrent and its reversal occur. The proposed system is analyzed by means of the Keldysh field theory approach based on the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudershan-Lindblad master equation and may be realized in ultracold atomic gases and solid-state systems.</p>

            <p>In 2015 Dmitry Petrov theoretically predicted that, in binary mixture of bosons a quantum liquid droplet may arise due to the competition between attractive intercomponent and repulsive intracomponent forces. Although this prediction has been confirmed experimentally, the model by itself suffers from a serious conceptual problem: The low - lying excitation spectrum manifests a purely imaginary phonon velocity, $c_d^2 < 0$. In present work we develop self consistent theory of two component Bose system with attractive inter species interaction, which accurately takes into account pair correlations in terms of anomalous and mixed densities. We have shown that this procedure is able to resolve the problem of $c_d^2 < 0$. Limiting ourselves with a symmetric Bose mixture at zero temperature, we have found a region of stability in which a droplet may survive.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently been shown to host native defects exhibiting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with applications in nanoscale magnetic sensing and imaging. To advance these applications, deposition methods to create wafer-scale hBN films with controlled thicknesses are desirable, but a systematic study of the ODMR properties of the resultant films is lacking. Here we perform ODMR measurements of thin films (3-2000nm thick) grown via three different methods: metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We find that they all exhibit an ODMR response, including the thinnest 3nm film, albeit with different characteristics. The best volume-normalised magnetic sensitivity obtained is 30uT/sqrt(Hz um^3). We study the effect of growth temperature on a series of MOCVD samples grown under otherwise fixed conditions and find 800-900C to be an optimum range for magnetic sensitivity, with a significant improvement (up to two orders of magnitude) from post-growth annealing. This work provides a useful baseline for the magnetic sensitivity of hBN thin films deposited via standard methods and informs the feasibility of future sensing applications.</p>

            <p>alpha-Sn has recently been attracting significant interest due to its unique electronic properties. However, this allotrope of Sn is stable only below 13 °C and alternative options to the conventional stabilization by epitaxial growth on InSb are still a challenge. In this work, nanoparticles with inner alpha-Sn nanocrystals were synthesized on a Silicon substrate via a CMOS-compatible process through microwave irradiation. The nanoparticle morphology was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy, demonstrating the ability to control the nanoparticle size by a dewetting process combined with a coalescence process induced by the microwaves. Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction analyses confirmed the stabilization of the alpha-Sn phase within a SnO2 shell, while X-Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy measurements revealed the presence of a bandgap. Infrared transmission spectroscopy combined with a Tauc-plot extrapolation led to an estimate of the gap in the range from 64 to 137 meV range. Furthermore, the possibility to tune the bandgap by controlling the nanoparticle size, possibly leveraging weak quantum confinement effects, was demonstrated, unveiling the potential of alpha-Sn nanoparticles on Si for the development of CMOS-compatible THz devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexis Poncet, Aurélien Grabsch, Olivier Bénichou</p>
            <p>Tracer diffusion in single-file systems, where particles are restricted to move on a line without passing each other, has been a fertile ground to investigate anomalous diffusion and strong memory effects. While the long-time behavior of such a tracer has been well studied, with a known subdiffusive dynamics and a Gaussian description for the rescaled position, the finer details of multi-time correlations remain poorly understood. This work focuses on the limit where almost all sites of a Symmetric Exclusion Process (SEP), a paradigmatic lattice model, are occupied. It extends beyond Gaussian descriptions and single-time statistics to address the multi-time correlation functions of the tracer in the SEP. In this dense limit, we present a general relation between all $n$-time correlations of the non-Markovian tracer position process and the conditional probabilities of a single Markovian random walker. Using this relation, we derive explicit expressions for the four-time correlations and further explore important extensions: multiple tracers, non-equilibrium situations, and finite observation times. Our results underscore significant memory effects, strong temporal correlations, and the influence of initial conditions on long-time dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Pair binding and Hund's rule breaking in high-symmetry fullerenes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Rausch, C. Karrasch</p>
            <p>Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using massive, large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results support an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding.</p>

            <p>We investigate linear and nonlinear transverse planar transport phenomena (viz. linear and nonlinear Hall and Nernst coefficients) induced by chiral anomaly in three-dimensional spin-orbit coupled metallic systems. Unlike Weyl semimetals, these systems do not possess multiple Weyl nodes located at isolated points in the momentum space but instead host a pair of Fermi surfaces characterized by opposite Berry curvature fluxes enclosing the same band-degeneracy point. Using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the relaxation time approximation, we derive first- and second-order transverse planar transport coefficients induced by electrical and thermal gradients in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals distinctive angular dependencies of the transport coefficients, along with characteristic scaling behavior with the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomaly-induced transport coefficients exhibit an exponential temperature dependence. This unconventional behavior leads to the violations of the Mott relation at comparatively low temperatures, highlighting unique thermoelectric signatures that can be probed experimentally in 3D spin-orbit coupled metallic systems.</p>

            <p>Scattering experiments are at the heart of high-energy physics (HEP), breaking matter down to its fundamental constituents, probing its formation, and providing deep insight into the inner workings of nature. In the current huge drive to forge quantum computers into complementary venues that are ideally suited to capture snapshots of far-from-equilibrium HEP dynamics, a major goal is to utilize these devices for scattering experiments. A major obstacle in this endeavor has been the hardware overhead required to access the late-time post-collision dynamics while implementing the underlying gauge symmetry. Here, we report on the first quantum simulation of scattering in a lattice gauge theory (LGT), performed on \texttt{IBM}'s \texttt{ibm\_marrakesh} quantum computer. Specifically, we quantum-simulate the collision dynamics of electrons and positrons as well as mesons in a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ LGT representing $1+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED), uncovering rich post-collision dynamics that we can precisely tune with a topological $\Theta$-term and the fermionic mass. By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring. Our work provides a major step forward in the utility of quantum computers for investigating the real-time quantum dynamics of HEP collisions.</p>

Our construction provides physical insight into how Fujikawa's higher-order Ginsparg-Wilson relation improves chiral symmetry while reproducing the anomaly, highlighting the trade-offs inherent in any Hamiltonian lattice realization of an anomalous chiral symmetry. This class of Hamiltonian lattice regularizations, with their tunable chiral symmetry properties, offers potential advantages for quantum and tensor-network simulations.</p>

            <h2>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maarten Golterman, Yigal Shamir</p>
            <p>Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.</p>

            <p>The integration of high-energy degrees of freedom along the renormalization group (RG) flow in Poincaré-invariant theories can be captured by a monotonic c-function. For such theories, holographic monotonic c-functions have been constructed using entanglement entropy. However, in theories with broken Lorentz invariance, such constructions generally fail, reflecting both the violation of the entanglement RG monotonicity and its limitations in capturing certain properties of non-relativistic RG flows. Since many quantum many-body systems lack Lorentz invariance, it is of significant importance to identify a quantity that reflects the decrease in degrees of freedom along non-relativistic RG flows. We show that the recently introduced holographic timelike entanglement entropy naturally gives rise to a new c-function applicable to all such theories. We further demonstrate the existence of this c-function in theories with Lifshitz and hyperscaling-violating fixed points, showing that, provided the null energy conditions and thermodynamic stability are satisfied, the proposed c-function exhibits the expected monotonic behavior along the RG flow.</p>

            <p>Topological phases are states of matter defined by global topological invariants that remain invariant under adiabatic parameter variations, provided no topological phase transition occurs. This endows them with intrinsic robustness against local perturbations. Experimentally, these phases are often identified indirectly by observing robust boundary states, protected by the bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we propose an experimental method for the direct measurement of topological invariants via adiabatic state evolution in electroacoustic coupled resonators, where time-dependent cavity modes effectively emulate the bulk wavefunction of a periodic system. Under varying external driving fields, specially prepared initial states evolve along distinct parameter-space paths. By tracking the relative phase differences among states along these trajectories, we successfully observe the quantized Zak phase in both the conventional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and its extension incorporating with next-nearest-neighbor coupling. This approach provides compelling experimental evidence for the precise identification of topological invariants and can be extended to more complex topological systems.</p>

The study reveals strong association between the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack on the 13 risk factors studied.

            <p>Magnon blockade is a physical mechanism for the preparation of a single-magnon source, which has important applications in quantum information processing. Here we propose a scheme for generating an optimal magnon blockade in the spin-magnon quantum system. By introducing frequency detuning between the magnon and the spin qubit of the NV center, the conventional magnon blockade and the unconventional magnon blockade can be obtained under both strong and weak coupling, relaxing the requirements for coupling strength. Moreover, the conventional and unconventional magnon blockade can occur simultaneously when both the magnon and the spin qubit are driven. This allows the equal-time second-order correlation function to reach $10^{-8}$, about five orders of magnitude lower than that in previous works. Additionally, the time-delayed second-order correlation function avoids oscillation. Our study demonstrates the impact of frequency detuning on the magnon blockade and proposes methods to enhance the magnon blockade and relax the requirements for coupling strength through frequency detuning.</p>

In all three models, consensus is an absorbing state in finite populations, while co-existence is a possible outcome of the deterministic dynamics. We show that sufficiently strong zealotry -- i.e., the presence of agents who never change state -- can drive infinite populations to consensus in all three models. However, while evolutionary games and the partisan voter model permit zealotry-induced consensus for all values of their model parameters, the nonlinear voter model does not. Central to this difference is the shape of the social impact function, which quantifies how the influence of a group scales with size, and is therefore a measure of majority and minority effects. We derive general conditions relating the slope of this function at small group sizes to the local stability of consensus. Sublinear impact favours minorities and can override zealotry to prevent consensus, whereas superlinear impact promotes majorities and therefore facilitates consensus. We extend the analysis to finite populations, exploring the time-to-consensus, and the shape of quasi-stationary distributions.</p>

            <h2>Probing the quantum motion of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator with a radio-frequency superconducting qubit</h2>

            <p>Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime offer a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, particularly owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated, and high-fidelity interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of 27~$\mathrm{\mu}$K and read out in a single-shot with 77% fidelity. During the membrane's 6~ms lifetime, the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the membrane's position noise-spectrum, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at 10~mK and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Diósi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</p>

            <h2>X-ray Absorption Linear Dichroism at the Ti K-edge of TiO2 anatase single crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T.C. Rossi, D. Grolimund, M. Nachtegaal, O. Cannelli, G.F. Mancini, C. Bacellar, D. Kinschel, J.R. Rouxel, N. Ohannessian, D. Pergolesi, T. Lippert, M. Chergui</p>
            <p>Anatase TiO2 (a-TiO2) exhibits a strong X-ray absorption linear dichroism with the X-ray incidence angle in the pre-edge, the XANES and the EXAFS at the titanium K-edge. In the pre-edge region the behaviour of the A1-A3 and B peaks, originating from the 1s-3d transitions, is due to the strong $p$-orbital polarization and strong $p-d$ orbital mixing. An unambiguous assignment of the pre-edge peak transitions is made in the monoelectronic approximation with the support of ab initio finite difference method calculations and spherical tensor analysis in quantitative agreement with the experiment. It is found that A1 is mostly an on-site 3d-4p hybridized transition, while peaks A3 and B are non-local transitions, with A3 being mostly dipolar and influence by the 3d-4p intersite hybridization, while B is due to interactions at longer range. Finally, peak A2 which was previously assigned to a transition involving pentacoordinated titanium atoms exhibits a quadrupolar angular evolution with incidence angle. These results pave the way to the use of the pre-edge peaks at the K-edge of a-TiO2 to characterize the electronic structure of related materials and in the field of ultrafast XAS where the linear dichroism can be used to compare the photophysics along different axes.</p>
