            <h2>Dynamical localization of interacting ultracold atoms in one-dimensional quasi-periodic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Attis V. M. Marino, M. A. Caracanhas, V. S. Bagnato, B. Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>We present numerically exact non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas in quasi-periodic lattice that plays an intermediate role between the long-ranged order and truly disordered systems exhibiting unusual correlated phases. Precision control over lattice depth, interaction strength and filling factor enables the exploration of various correlated phases in a finite periodic lattice. We investigate the system dynamics when the secondary incommensurate lattice is abruptly switched on. To solve the many-body Schroedinger equation, we employ the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB). The many-body dynamics are analyzed through distinct measures of the Glauber correlation functions and dynamical fragmentation. Our study reveals four distinct scenarios of localization process in the non-equilibrium dynamics. Weakly interacting non-fragmented superfluid of incommensurate filling in the primary lattice exhibits collapse-revival dynamics of localization. In contrast, a fragmented superfluid with commensurate filling exhibits dynamical Mott localization. A strongly correlated, fully fragmented Mott state shows a subtle competition with localization introduced by the secondary lattice that merely melts the Mott correlations. Interestingly, in the fermionized Mott regime, where the density in each well is fragmented, the intra-dimer correlations exhibit unexpected robustness. These findings provide new insights into many-body correlation dynamics and novel localization mechanisms in quasi-periodic lattices, paving the way for engineering exotic quantum behaviors in ultracold atomic systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Dynamics of Electron Scattering from Skyrmions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hareram Swain, Arijit Mandal, S. Satpathy, B.R.K. Nanda</p>
            <p>Scattering of electrons from chiral spin textures such as the skyrmions is an emerging research area due to its richness in topological quantum transport, which is significant for spintronic devices. We study the dynamical process of scattering of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the form of Gaussian wavepackets from skyrmions with the aid of the non-relativistic time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The scattering cross section shows a rich angular dependence and is deterministically influenced by the iterative flipping of the spin state inside the skyrmion. The latter leads to a set of non-trivial outcomes which include finite transmission and reflection probabilities irrespective of interaction strength, formation of secondary wavefronts associated with back-converted spin components, and a long-lived quasi-bound state at the scattering center. In addition to the rich and intriguing physics, the numerical recipe developed here can be easily adopted for any arbitrary spin texture, which will prepare a playground to explore tunable spin transport.</p>

            <h2>Ramp Josephson junctions of Al/Ti/Sr2RuO4: Observation of single-domain quantum oscillations and the detection of chiral edge current</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Li, Yiqun Alex Ying, Brian M. Zakrzewski, Yan Xin, Yu Wang, Zhiqiang Mao, Ying Liu</p>
            <p>The spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS), one of the hallmarks of unconventional superconductivity, has been observed in the superconducting state of Sr2RuO4 by muon spin rotation in several independent studies. However, the chiral edge current expected in such a superconductor has not yet been established experimentally. In addition, the angle dependence of the phase of the superconducting order parameter (OP) in Sr2RuO4, which would enable determination of the full symmetry properties of the OP, has been determined only for a couple of angles. Both issues can be addressed by preparing high-quality Josephson junctions between Sr2RuO4 and a conventional s-wave superconductor with varying orientations relative to the crystal axes. Here we report the successful fabrication of ramp Josephson junctions of Al/Ti/ Sr2RuO4 on thin single crystals of Sr2RuO4 obtained by mechanical exfoliation. These junctions exhibit high-quality quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field. Moreover, the junction resistance was found to be extremely sensitive to the current flowing in the Sr2RuO4 crystal, a feature that was used in this work to show that the chiral edge current. The approach to the chiral edge current detection, which was not used previously, was verified by a control experiment.</p>

            <h2>Rapid Autotuning of a SiGe Quantum Dot into the Single-Electron Regime with Machine Learning and RF-Reflectometry FPGA-Based Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc-Antoine Roux, Joffrey Rivard, Victor Yon, Alexis Morel, Dominic Leclerc, Claude Rohrbacher, El Bachir Ndiaye, Felice Francesco Tafuri, Brendan Bono, Stefan Kubicek, Roger Loo, Yosuke Shimura, Julien Jussot, Clément Godfrin, Danny Wan, Kristiaan De Greve, Marc-André Tétrault, Dominique Drouin, Christian Lupien, Michel Pioro-Ladrière, Eva Dupont-Ferrier</p>
            <p>Spin qubits need to operate within a very precise voltage space around charge state transitions to achieve high-fidelity gates. However, the stability diagrams that allow the identification of the desired charge states are long to acquire. Moreover, the voltage space to search for the desired charge state increases quickly with the number of qubits. Therefore, faster stability diagram acquisitions are needed to scale up a spin qubit quantum processor. Currently, most methods focus on more efficient data sampling. Our approach shows a significant speedup by combining measurement speedup and a reduction in the number of measurements needed to tune a quantum dot device. Using an autotuning algorithm based on a neural network and faster measurements by harnessing the FPGA embedded in Keysight's Quantum Engineering Toolkit (QET), the measurement time of stability diagrams has been reduced by a factor of 9.8. This led to an acceleration factor of 2.2 for the total initialization time of a SiGe quantum dot into the single-electron regime, which is limited by the Python code execution.</p>

            <h2>Quantum criticality in cuprate superconductors revealed by optical conductivity measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hwiwoo Park, Sung-Sik Lee, G. D. Gu, Jungseek Hwang</p>
            <p>The ubiquitous temperature ($T$)-linear behaviour of the transport scattering rate in the normal state of strongly correlated electron systems is called strange metallicity \cite{zaanen:2004,phillips:2022,hartnoll:2022,chowdhury:2022,yuan:2022}. Although strange metallicity is crucial to understanding superconductivity in correlated electron systems, its origin remains elusive to date \cite{hussey:2023}. Here, we present the doping-, temperature-, and frequency ($\omega$)-dependent transport properties of overdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ in a wide doping range of 0.183 to 0.231. We observe that the optical scattering rate and effective mass exhibit an $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour at a critical doping of $p_{c} \simeq$ 0.231. Away from the critical doping, the $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour is destroyed below a doping-dependent crossover temperature $T_\Delta(p) \sim |p-p_{c}|^{0.24}$. Furthermore, the optical coherence mode (OCM) observed within the superconducting dome rapidly broadens and eventually disappears as the critical doping is approached. The emergence of the $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour of the transport scattering rate and broadening of the OCM near the critical doping strongly suggests that strange metallic behaviour is caused by quantum critical fluctuations. Our results provide compelling spectroscopic evidence for quantum criticality in cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Hybridization gap and $f$-electron effect evolutions with Cd- and Sn-doping in CeCoIn$_5$ via infrared spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Myounghoon Lee, Yu-Seong Seo, Seulki Roh, Seokbae Lee, Jihyun Kim, Tuson Park, Jungseek Hwang</p>
            <p>We investigated hole (Cd)- and electron (Sn)-doped CeCoIn$_5$ (CeCo(In$_{1-x}T_x$)$_5$ ($T$ = Cd or Sn)) using infrared spectroscopy. Doping-dependent hybridization gap distribution functions were obtained from the optical conductivity spectra based on the periodic Anderson model formalism. The hybridization gap distribution exhibits two components: in-plane and out-of-plane hybridization gaps. The doping-dependent evolution of the two gaps indicated that the out-of-plane gap was more sensitive to doping. Furthermore, the magnetic optical resistivity exhibited a doping-dependent evolution of the $f$-electron amplitude. The two dopant types exhibited different physical properties depending on the level of doping. The Sn dopant increases the $f$-electron amplitude, whereas the Cd dopant does not affect the $f$-electron amplitude. Doping-dependent effective mass is peaked at pure (or undoped) CeCoIn$_5$. Our spectroscopic results may help understand the doping-dependent electronic evolution of one of the canonical heavy fermion systems, CeCoIn$_5$.</p>

            <h2>Harmonic and Subharmonic Magnon Generation in a Surface Acoustic Wave Resonator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunyoung Hwang, Liyang Liao, Jorge Puebla, Marco Brühlmann, Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero, Kouta Kondou, Naoki Ogawa, Sadamichi Maekawa, Yoshichika Otani</p>
            <p>We experimentally observe the generation of magnon harmonics and subharmonics in an on-chip surface acoustic wave resonator incorporating a thin Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ film, using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering. In our devices, rotating the in-plane magnetic field allows continuous tuning of the magnon-phonon coupling from weak to strong within the same resonator. In the weak coupling regime, we only observe fundamental magnetoelastic wave signal at $f_{1}$. Conversely, in the strong coupling regime, in addition to the fundamental magnetoelastic wave, we observe subharmonic and harmonic signals at $3/2f_{1}$, $2f_{1}$, and $3f_{1}$, which are well reproduced by our analytical model. Our results establish phonons as a means to generate and control nonlinear magnons in the strong coupling regime, providing a new route for magnonic signal processing.</p>

            <h2>Domain wall skyrmion-based magnonic crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyu Wang, Xingen Zheng, Zhixiong Li, Zhizhi Zhang, Xiansi Wang</p>
            <p>Magnonic waveguide based on domain wall (DW) is considered as a crucial breakthrough toward the realization of magnonic nanocircuits. However, the effective control of spin waves propagating in DWs remains to be explored. Here, we construct a magnonic crystal (MC) by using a chain of the domain wall skyrmions (DWSKs) to manipulate the spin-wave propagation in DWs. We show that the DWSK chain can be created by leveraging voltage-controlled Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The DWSK-based MC opens magnonic bandgaps, which can be dynamically adjusted through magnetic fields modulating the DWSK size. Furthermore, the manipulation of spin waves by the DWSK-based MC maintains robust in curved DW, demonstrating its adaptability to complex device architectures. Our work provides an effective method to control the spin-wave propagation in DWs and paves the way for designing energy-efficient magnonic nanocircuits.</p>

            <h2>A General Many-Body Perturbation Framework for Moiré Systems: Application to Rhombohedral Pentalayer Graphene/hBN Heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Lu, Yuanfan Yang, Zhongqing Guo, Jianpeng Liu</p>
            <p>Moiré superlattices host a rich variety of correlated topological states, including interaction-driven integer and fractional Chern insulators. A common approach to study interacting ground states at integer fillings is the Hartree-Fock mean-field method. However, this method neglects dynamical correlations, which often leads to an overestimation of spontaneous symmetry breaking and fails to provide quantitative descriptions of single-particle excitations. This work introduces a general many-body perturbation framework for moiré systems, combining all-band Hartree-Fock calculations with random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies and $GW$ quasiparticle corrections. We apply this framework to moiré superlattice consisted of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. Our all-band Hartree-Fock calculations, which include all plane-wave components up to the high-energy cutoff of the continuum model, reveal a phase diagram at moiré filling $\nu=1$ that qualitatively aligns with experimental measurements. Incorporating RPA correlation energy further yields quantitative agreement with the evolution of transport properties across electric fields. The $GW$ quasiparticle bands exhibit significantly reduced gaps and bandwidths compared to Hartree-Fock results, while quasiparticle weights close to unity indicate that the ground state is well-described by a Slater determinant, justifying the qualitative effectiveness of mean-field approaches for integer fillings in this system. Our versatile framework provides a systematic beyond-mean-field approach applicable to generic moiré systems.</p>

            <h2>Grand thermodynamic potential in a two-band unconventional superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. A. Shestakov, M. M. Korshunov</p>
            <p>In a two-band system, both conventional sign-preserving $s_{++}$ and unconventional sign-changing $s_{\pm}$ superconducting state may appear at low temperatures. Moreover, they may transform from one to another due to the impurity scattering. To study the details of such a transition here we derive the expression for the Grand thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ for a two-band model with nonmagnetic impurities considered in a $\mathcal{T}$-matrix approximation. For the iron-based materials within the multiband Eliashberg theory, we show that the $s_{\pm} \to s_{++}$ transition in the vicinity of the Born limit is a first order phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Ab initio investigation on structural stability and phonon-mediated superconductivity in 2D-hydrogenated M2X (M= Mo, V, Zr; X=C, N) MXene monolayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakkapat Seeyangnok, Udomsilp Pinsook</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive first-principles study of hydrogenated M2X (M = Mo, V, Zr; X = C, N) MXene monolayers, focusing on their structural stability, electronic properties, and superconducting behavior. Structural optimizations combined with phonon spectra reveal that partial hydrogenation (1H and 2H) is dynamically stable across most compositions, while full hydrogenation (4H) generally induces lattice instabilities. A notable exception is Zr2CH4, which retains dynamical stability even under maximum hydrogen coverage. Electronic structure analysis shows that all hydrogenated MXenes remain metallic, with the Fermi level dominated by transition-metal d orbitals. In Zr2CH4, a Dirac-like band crossing at the Fermi level is observed, which is gapped by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yielding a finite gap of 0.095 eV. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations demonstrate that Mo-based MXenes exhibit strong EPC, with coupling constants lambda = 0.95 (Mo2CH), 1.23 (Mo2NH), and 1.55 (Mo2NH2), corresponding to superconducting critical temperatures Tc about 15 to 22 K within the Allen-Dynes framework (mu* = 0.10). By contrast, V- and Zr-based MXenes display weak EPC and negligible Tc, with Zr2CH4 being a special case hosting Dirac-like states rather than superconductivity. Our findings highlight hydrogen functionalization as an effective strategy to stabilize MXene monolayers and to tune their low-energy physics, revealing Mo-based nitride MXenes as promising phonon-mediated superconductors, while Zr2CH4 emerges as a candidate for Dirac physics.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical prediction of Structural Stability and Superconductivity in Janus Ti2CSH MXene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakkapat Seeyangnok, Udomsilp Pinsook</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural stability, vibrational characteristics, and superconducting properties of the Janus Ti2CSH monolayer. Janus MXene (JMXene) materials, such as Ti2CSH, have attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic two-dimensional structure and the absence of out-of-plane symmetry, which give rise to novel physical phenomena. Phonon calculations confirm the dynamical stability of the monolayer, while electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling analyses reveal a strong phonon-mediated pairing mechanism. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory predicts a single-gap superconducting state, with gap values between 4.29 and 4.71 meV at 10 K and a critical temperature Tc of 22.6 K. These findings establish Ti2CSH as a promising two-dimensional superconductor with potential applications in quantum and nanoscale technologies.</p>

            <h2>Phase Stability and Superconductivity in Hydrogenated and Lithiated Janus GaXS2 (X = Ga, In) Monolayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakkapat Seeyangnok, Udomsilp Pinsook</p>
            <p>Hydrogen and lithium functionalization of two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a promising route to enhance electronic properties and induce superconductivity. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to explore the phase stability and superconducting behavior of hydrogenated and lithiated Janus GaXS2 (X = Ga, In) monolayers. Among Ga2SH, Ga2SLi, GaInSH, and GaInSLi, only the 2H-GaInSLi structure is dynamically, thermally, and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon dispersion, ab initio molecular dynamics, and elastic constants. This monolayer adopts a hexagonal lattice, exhibits metallic behavior, and has a negative formation energy, suggesting experimental feasibility. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis reveals phonon-mediated superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.8 K. Notably, three distinct superconducting gaps emerge, linked to specific atomic orbitals and phonon modes. Electron doping of 0.2 e per cell increases Tc to nearly 6.2 K while maintaining the three-gap character. These results highlight the effectiveness of selective functionalization in engineering superconductivity and identify GaInSLi as a promising platform for next-generation multi-gap 2D superconducting devices.</p>

            <h2>Exploration of Altermagnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Xin Li, Yiyuan Chen, Liqing Pan, Shuai Li, Song-Bo Zhang, Hai-Zhou Lu</p>
            <p>The fundamental role of magnetic materials in modern science and technology has driven a rapid surge in research on unconventional magnetism in recent years. In particular, altermagnets, which simultaneously exhibit zero net magnetization in real space and anisotropic spin splitting in momentum space, have garnered significant interest for both fundamental physics and technological applications. Among these, $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ stands as the pioneering and most extensively studied altermagnet. While the intrinsic magnetic order of $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ is still a subject of active debate, numerous exotic phenomena characteristic of altermagnetism have been observed in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ samples. In this review, we explore each facet of the altermagnetism through specific case studies in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, systematically surveying its crystal and magnetic structures, electronic band properties, and transport phenomena. We critically assess the debate surrounding the intrinsic magnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, incorporating evidence from altermagnetic signatures in transport, as well as contrasting results from magnetic and spectroscopic measurements. Finally, possible future research directions in this field are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Smart copolymer microgels with high volume phase transition temperature: Composition, swelling, and morphology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditi Gujare, Stefanie Uredat, Jonas Runge, Felix Morgenstern, Domenico Truzzolillo, Thomas Hellweg, Julian Oberdisse</p>
            <p>The thermosensitivity and microstructure of microgels made by copolymerizing standard microgel-forming monomers with more hydrophilic comonomers is investigated, with the aim of increasing the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT). We precisely determine the incorporation of N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide (HMAM) and purpose-synthesized N-(2-hydroxyisopropyl)acrylamide (HIPAM) into microgels -- neither of which forms microgels on its own by precipitation polymerization. The swelling properties and microstructure of the resulting copolymer microgels with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM, LCST ca. 32°C) and N-isopropylmethacrylamide (NIPMAM, LCST ca. 44°C) are then characterized via turbidimetry, DLS, and AFM. At low comonomer contents, all microgel particles exhibit moderate growth in size. Beyond a system-specific threshold, we observe a significant jump in size, and smoother swelling behavior. For NIPAM-HIPAM, the size increase is linked to a strong rise in swelling capacity, and the formation of a thick corona. The effect of the hydrophilic comonomers on the VPTT correlates linearly with their true composition, allowing us to extrapolate the VPTT of hypothetical pure HMAM and HIPAM microgels. This leads to 99°C for HMAM, and 68°C for HIPAM for the respective VPTT. These numbers can be seen as useful indicators of the effect of these monomers on the VPTT in the copolymerized microgels. The observed changes in VPTT, swelling, size, and morphology suggest that high-VPTT microgels possess unique internal molecular composition gradients, likely due to hydrophobic interactions during synthesis. Our results have potential implications for developing temperature-sensitive microgel-based membranes that can self-adapt their permeability at higher operating temperatures in energy applications.</p>

            <h2>Type-II Band Alignment in the $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/Rutile GeO$_2$ Heterojunction toward Solar-Blind Photodetection: A first-principles study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Q. Fang</p>
            <p>Semiconductor heterostructures capable of separating photogenerated electrons and holes have a wide range of optoelectronic applications, including photodetectors, solar cells, and photocatalysts. ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and rutile GeO$_2$ are both ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors, with bandgaps of 4.85 eV and 4.68 eV, respectively. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to investigate the band alignment of the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$ heterojunction and explore the effect of interfacial oxygen vacancy. Calculations using the PBE0 hybrid functional based on an interface model show that a type-II band alignment emerges at the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$ interface, which facilitates the separation of photogenerated carriers. The valence band maximum of ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ lies 0.38 eV below that of rutile GeO$_2$, and its conduction band minimum lies 0.36 eV below. The presence of interfacial oxygen vacancy in the stable configuration leads to a reduction in the band offset. Our results suggest that the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$ heterojunction holds significant promise for application in strictly solar-blind photodetectors.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Grand Canonical Global Optimization with On-the-fly-trained Machine-learning Interatomic Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jon Eunan Quinlivan Dominguez, Mads-Peter Verner Christiansen, Konstantin M. Neyman, Bøjrk Hammer, Albert Bruix</p>
            <p>The characterization of nanostructued materials under reactive environments is challenging due to the complexity of the structural motifs involved and their chemical transformations. Global optimization approaches allow predicting stable structures for targeted materials but addressing the configurational and compositional search spaces is both computationally demanding and inefficient, especially when first principles calculations are required. In this work, we implement and evaluate a computationally efficient grand canonical global optimization algorithm able to identify stable structures and chemical states of targeted systems under given reaction conditions (e.g. reactant pressure and temperature). The algorithm leverages an on-the-fly trained machine-learning interatomic potential based on sparse Gaussian Process Regression and the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor to reduce the number of first principles energy evaluations carried out during global optimization searches. The \textit{ab initio} thermodynamics framework is incorporated to approximate the Gibbs energy of evaluated candidates, performing environment-aware optimizations over multiple stoichiometries. We demonstrate the computational performance of this approach and its ability to reproduce some literature examples.</p>

            <h2>High pressure lattice dynamics study of few layer-$α$-In$_2$Se$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiyu Feng, Anurag Ghosh, Gautham Vijayan, Ziyi Xu, Qian Zhang, Elad Koren, Elissaios Stavrou</p>
            <p>Few-layer $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ has been studied under pressure using Raman spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell up to 60 GPa (at room temperature). A combination of AFM and Raman was used to estimate the thickness of the specimens. While few-layer $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ shows identical structural evolution with the one of the bulk powder-like form of $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ ( $\alpha$ $\rightarrow$ $\beta^{'}$ $\rightarrow$ IV ), an abrupt $\beta^{'}$ $\rightarrow$ IV phase transition (at 45 GPa) was observed, in contrast with the case of the bulk specimen where the two phases coexist over a wide pressure range. This is attributed to the difference in specimens morphology, $i.e.$ single crystal and powder in the case of few-layer and bulk $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$, respectively. This study documents the significance of specimens morphology on the observed pressure-induced phase transitions. The methodology developed in this study for performing high-pressure Raman measurements can be applied to other nanodimensional layered materials.</p>

            <p>Active particle systems are a class of non-equilibrium systems composed of self-propelled Brownian particles; through interactions between particles within the system, a variety of intriguing collective behaviors can emerge. Based on Brownian dynamics simulations, this study investigates the formation and transition mechanisms of ordered structures in active particle systems regulated by light fields. The study reveals that, under light field regulation, active particles undergo large-scale phase separation behavior, forming specific ordered structures and enabling the dynamic transition between multiple ordered structures. This study systematically explores the effects of light fields on this dynamic phase transition and the corresponding regulatory mechanisms. The research findings provide important references for the precise regulation of collective structures in active systems and the fabrication of micro-nano intelligent devices.</p>

            <p>Graphene, through the coexistence of large cyclotron gaps and small spin and valley gaps, offers the possibility to study the breakdown of the quantum Hall effect across a wide range of energy scales. In this work, we investigate the breakdown of the QHE in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband excitation ranging from DC up to 10 GHz. We find that the conductance is consistently described by variable range hopping (VRH) and extract the hopping energies from both temperature and field-driven measurements. Using VRH thermometry, we are able to distinguish between a cold and hot electron regime, which are dominated by non-ohmic VRH and Joule heating, respectively. Our results demonstrate that breakdown in the quantum Hall regime of graphene is governed by a crossover from non-ohmic, field-driven VRH to ohmic, Joule-heating-dominated transport.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of symmetry constraint in Floquet topological superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>Topological superconductor is regarded as an ideal candidate for topological quantum computing due to its ability to simulate the enigmatic Majorana fermions that satisfy non-Abelian statistics. Previous studies revealed that symmetry exerts an unbreakable constraint on the existence, classes, and orders of Majorana modes. It severely limits the controllability and application of Majorana modes. Here, we propose a Floquet-engineering method to break this symmetry-imposed constraint on topological phases. By applying periodic driving on a system belonging to a symmetry class that prohibits the existence of first-order topological phases, we find that rich first-order Majorana modes are created. Interestingly, exotic hybrid-order topological superconductors with coexisting first-order Majorana boundary modes and second-order Majorana corner modes not only in two different quasienergy gaps but also in one single gap are generated at ease by the periodic driving. Refreshing the prevailing understanding of symmetry constraint on topological phases, our result opens an avenue for the creation of exotic topological superconductors without altering symmetries. It greatly expands the scope of the fabricated materials that host topological superconductor.</p>

            <p>We study the activity of "living" droplets, which confine 1-6 mesoswimmers in 3D using a superhydrophobic substrate. The swimmers induce oscillations of the droplets at their inherent resonant frequencies, regardless of swimmer size and number. In contrast, the droplet oscillation amplitude is strongly affected by crowding, which we successfully model with a new scaling law and show that crowding reduces the speed of the swimmers. These fundamental living matter physics results reveal mechanisms for bio-inspired droplet actuation with implications for mesoscale robotics, fluidics, and sensing.</p>

            <p>Non-relativistic spin splitting in antiferromagnets has recently attracted considerable attention. Here we present a universal framework for controlling such spin splitting by identifying and manipulating the key atomic distortions that govern it through external perturbations. We demonstrate this concept by tuning the spin-splitting energy in three representative materials with diverse symmetries, inversion-symmetric MnF$_2$, ferroelectric BaCuF$_4$, and LaMnO$_3$/RMnO$_3$ superlattices. Our results emphasize the essential role of higher-order magnetic multipoles and the intrinsic structure-spin correlations in these systems, thereby advancing current efforts to control spin splitting in real materials and motivating future experimental studies.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Li-Haldane Correspondence in Critical Free-Fermion Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.</p>

            <p>Neuromorphic computing circuits can be realized using memristors based on low-dimensional materials enabling enhanced metal diffusion for resistive switching. Here, we investigate memristive properties of vertically aligned MoS$_2$ (VA-MoS$_2$) films with three different metal electrodes: Ag, Cu, and Au. Despite having the same active material, all three metals show distinct switching behavior, which are crucial for neuromorphic computing applications: Ag enables volatile switching, Cu demonstrates stable non-volatile switching with retention over 2500 s, and Au shows no memristive response. Cu devices show abrupt resistance changes, and significant increase of copper content upon biasing, indicative of stable non-volatile switching based on filament formation and rupture. About 85% of Ag and Cu devices exhibit reliable memristor behavior. Our findings provide valuable insights into the memristive switching mechanism in VA-MoS$_2$ and present a promising avenue for facile fabrication of neuromorphic circuits by employing a set of different metals on a single active material.</p>

            <h2>Glassy dynamics in two-dimensional ring polymers: size versus stiffness polydispersity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Nayak, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Satyavani Vemparala</p>
            <p>Soft glassy materials often consist of deformable objects. Here, we use a two-dimensional assembly of semi-flexible ring polymers as a model system to investigate how polydispersity in particle stiffness or size influences the onset of glassy dynamics. In simulations at fixed polydispersity 30%, we find that stiffness dispersity drives most rings into elongated conformations at high densities, leading to orientationally ordered structures that cause dynamical slowing down. In contrast, size dispersity generates a bimodal population: small rings remain circular and act as rigid inclusions, while large rings elongate, producing frustration that delays arrest. Real-space maps of bond relaxation reveal strikingly different pathways of dynamical heterogeneity, with long-lived domains persisting under stiffness dispersity but rapidly percolating relaxation under size dispersity. Moreover, local correlations between ring shape, orientational order, and mobility show that stiffness dispersity produces dynamics that are strongly structure-sensitive, whereas size dispersity activates motion from both circular and elongated populations. By linking microscopic deformability to emergent glassy dynamics, this study identifies how the nature of polydispersity controls the relaxation pathways of soft glasses.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kadir Çeven, Lukas Peinemann, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner</p>
            <p>Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.</p>

            <p>Lead halide perovskites have catalyzed the rise of main-group metal halide materials as promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronics, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, sensors, and photocatalysts. Among these, effi-cient light-emission arises from self-trapped excitons, wherein excited states induce transient lattice distortions that localize excitons. However, the complex interplay of factors, such as lattice distortions, lattice softness, and electron-phonon cou-pling dynamics, obscures the direct structure-property relationships complicating the targeted material design. In this study, we advance the understanding of self-trapped exciton (STE)-based emission in hybrid antimony and bismuth halides, em-phasizing the interplay of structural and electronic factors that enhance white-light emission. We systematically vary com-position, anion dimensionality, connectivity, and the organic cation and find that the presence of Bi/Sb and Cl in edge-sharing anion motifs promotes white-light emission and optimal electron-phonon coupling. Chlorides outperform bromides, and organic cations, such as CMA and BZA, only subtly influence optical behavior by altering lattice dynamics and rigidity, resulting in tunable emission characteristics without compromising STEs. This work deepens the understanding of the emis-sion mechanisms in hybrid halide perovskites and establishes guiding principles for tailoring optoelectronic properties, paving the way for advanced materials with enhanced white-light emission for next-generation optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantitative description of the surface tension minimum in a two-component surfactant system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edgar M. Blokhuis</p>
            <p>The Gibbs adsorption equation is the thermodynamic cornerstone for the description and understanding of the surface tension in a surfactant solution. It relates the decrease in surface tension to an increased surfactant adsorption. In the early 1940's, it therefore puzzled researchers to sometimes observe a minimum in the surface tension for certain surfactant solutions, which seemed to indicate surfactant desorption (even depletion) according to the Gibbs adsorption equation. It is now understood that the minimum is related to contamination of the surfactant (notably by dodecanol) and its occurrence has since then been studied extensively in experiments. Still, the precise role of the (tiny amount of) contaminant present is not well understood and a quantitative description and understanding of the minimum in the experimental surface tension is lacking. It is the aim of the present article to provide such a quantitative description. Our theoretical analysis is based on a Statistical Thermodynamic treatment of the Langmuir model for a surfactant mixture combined with the mass action model adapted to describe the formation of mixed micelles. A new Statistical Thermodynamic expression for the surface tension is derived and used to compare with a number of surface tension experiments for both ionic and non-ionic surfactant systems.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets, a class of unconventional antiferromagnets where antiparallel spins are connected by combined rotational and translational symmetries, have recently emerged as promising candidates for spintronic applications, as they can efficiently generate spin currents while maintaining vanishing net magnetization. Here, we investigate charge transport and spin currents in $\alpha$-MnTe, a prototypical altermagnet, using symmetry analysis within the multipole framework and fully relativistic first-principles calculations using the Kubo formalism. Our results show that different magnetic configurations with Néel vectors $\hat{N}\parallel y$ and $\hat{N}\parallel x$ in MnTe induce distinct order parameters. This distinction gives rise to spin-momentum locking with different parities and magnetic spin Hall effects (magnetic SHEs) with different anisotropies. Strikingly, our calculations show that the combination of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and altermagnetic spin splitting yields a large magnetic spin Hall angle of up to 16 \% rivaling or exceeding that of heavy metals such as Pt. On the other hand, the anisotropy of the magnetic SHE provides a practical means to identify the type of order parameter. This establishes, through the powerful framework of multipoles, a general approach for studying transport phenomena that extends to a broader class of altermagnets beyond MnTe.</p>

            <p>Recent studies of the self-assembly of Langmuir monolayers have revealed novel forms of lateral molecular ordering. Such studies typically involve the use of grazing-incidence synchrotron radiation scattering, and the lateral order manifests itself as distinct diffraction patterns. The more intricate the molecular organization, the more complicated the corresponding diffraction pattern is. To the point where standard analysis, i.e., identifying peak positions and solving the crystal structure, is insufficient to describe the system. In such cases, a physics-based simulation of the diffraction is required. In this article, we present a versatile theoretical framework for simulating complex structural molecular ordering in Langmuir monolayers. We begin by applying the formalism to a simple case of solid-state monolayers and extend the analysis to describe the structural organization in the collapsed state. The applicability of the method is validated through comparison with experimental data collected at the bending magnet synchrotron beamline.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Blumenfeld</p>
            <p>A long-standing problem has been a theoretical prediction of the densest packing fraction of random packings, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of same-size discs in $d=2$ and spheres in $3$. However, to minimize order, experiments and numerical simulations often use two-size discs. For practical purposes, then, a predictive theory for the packing fraction, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of the densest such bidisperse packings is more useful. A disorder-guaranteeing theory is formulated here to fill this gap, using an approach that led to an exact solution for monodisperse discs in $d=2$ [1]. $\Phi_{RCP}$ depends on the sizes ratio, $D$, and concentrations, $p$, of the disc types and the developed theory enables derivation of exact and rigorous upper and lower bounds on $\Phi_{RCP}(p,D)$, as well as an explicit prediction of it.</p>

            <p>Kagome materials with charge density waves (CDWs) are fascinating quantum systems, offering an ideal platform to explore intertwined orders and to uncover novel mechanisms behind CDW formation. Chemical models have been developed and applied to predict CDW in $AM_6X_6$-type kagome materials, such as the rattling chain model based on ScV6Sn6 and the magnetic energy-saving model based on FeGe. In this study, we successfully synthesized Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6 single crystals using the vapor transport method. As predicted by the rattling chain model, these crystals are expected to exhibit kagome CDW behavior. Magnetization measurements indicate that Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6 is an easy-axis antiferromagnet with T_N = 488 K and transport measurements reveal metallic behavior primarily driven by electron-type carriers. However, no clear signatures of a CDW were observed in Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate a markedly distinct electronic structure compared to related compounds: instead of a carrier-doping-induced rigid shift, the density of states shifted away from the Fermi level. Consistent with our structural investigations, the absence of a CDW and the unusual band structure can be attributed to the bonding characteristic within Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6. The strong covalent bonds of Ti-Ge1b, along with the solid Ge1b-Ge1b dimers, prevent the Ti-Ge1b-Ge1b-Ti chain from rattling. The presence of Fe-Fe antibonding state at the Fermi level enhances the spin polarization and depletes the electronic density around the Fermi level. Our results suggest that both the ionic radius and the bonding characteristics of the filler atom are crucial for the formation of CDWs in kagome materials. These factors can serve as supplementary terms to the rattling chain model, providing new insights for the discovery of novel kagome CDW materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taoufik Sakhraoui, František Karlický</p>
            <p>Using the density functional tight binding method (DFTB) and the GFN1-xTB (Geometries, Frequencies, and Noncovalent interactions Tight Binding) Hamiltonian, we have investigated the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of vacancy defects, hydrogen and oxygen passivated defects, and Fe adsorption in two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride (gt-C$_3$N$_4$) 2D material. The ring shape is the most preferred vacancy evolution path, with significant stability of the semicircle fourfold C-N-C-N vacancy. We found that bare gt-C$_3$N$_4$ which is non-magnetic becomes magnetic by 2-, and 5-defects creation, hydrogen/oxygen passivation of the defects, and upon Fe adsorption. Interestingly, Fe atoms interact with the gt-C$_3$N$_4$ sheet and result in a ground ferromagnetic (FM) state. In addition, we investigate the effects of passivating the vacancies by hydrogen in gt-C$_3$N$_4$ on its structural, electrical, and magnetic properties. We found that substituting the 1, 2, and 3 vacancies with hydrogen and passivating the 6-defect with oxygen turns on magnetism in the system. Due to structural distortion, the passivated defects do not have a well-ordered magnetic orientation. However, passivating the remaining defected structures maintains the nonmagnetic state. It is also shown that passivation leads to a semiconductor with a band gap value higher than that of the bare material. We also calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal (TM) atoms, including V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni-adsorbed gt-C$_3$N$_4$ monolayer. All TM atoms show slight lattice distortion, and the adsorbed system almost maintains the original structure type. Moreover, a FM alignment was observed with a total magnetic moments of 2.89 $\mu_B$, 2 $\mu_B$, and 1 $\mu_B$ for V, Fe, and Co atoms, respectively. The Cr, Mn, and Ni atoms induce no magnetism to the non magnetic gt-C$_3$N$_4$ system.</p>

            <p>The quantum Hall effect hosts quantum phase transitions in which the localization length, that is the size of disorder-induced bulk localized states, is governed by universal scaling from percolation theory. However, this universal character is not systematically observed in experiments, including very recent ones in extremely clean devices. Here we explore this non-universality by systematically measuring the localization length in broken-symmetry quantum Hall states of graphene. Depending on the nature and gap size of these states, we observe differences of up to a tenfold in the minimum localization length, accompanied by clear deviations from universal scaling. Our results, as well as the previously observed non-universality, are fully captured by a simple picture based on the co-existence of localized states from two successive sub-Landau levels.</p>

            <p>Low-dimensional materials have attractive properties that drive intense efforts for novel materials discovery. However, experiments are tedious for systematic discovery, and present computational methods are often tuned to two-dimensional (2D) materials, overlooking other low-dimensional materials.

We first benchmarked UMLIPs' first-principles-level accuracy in quantifying FCs and calculated phonons for 35,689 materials from the Materials Project database. We then used the FC-based method for dimensionality classification to discover 9139 low-dimensional materials, including 1838 0D clusters, 1760 1D chains, 3057 2D sheets/layers, and 2484 mixed-dimensionality materials, all of which conventional geometric descriptors have not recognized.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor N. Karnaukhov</p>
            <p>A modified Anderson lattice is proposed, whose the Hamiltonian accounts for the two-particle hybridization of localized and itinerant electrons instead of one-particle hybridization which takes into account in the original Anderson model. The 1D version of this model can be solved using the Bethe ansazt. It has been shown that hybridization between itinerant and frozen localized electrons results in an effective on-site interaction between itinerant electrons. The magnitude and sign of this interaction depend on the position of the level relative to the Fermi energy (the energy of this level corresponds to the two-particle state of localized electrons at a site). It is shown that when the energy of an localized electron in the two-particle state lies above the Fermi energy, the effective on-site interaction between itinerant electrons is attractive. A repulsive interaction between itinerant electrons occurs when this energy lies below the Fermi energy. Thus, two-part hybridization between localized and itinerant electrons can lead to effective attraction between itinerant electrons, which is unique in itself and may underlie the nature of high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

In the slow fluctuation limit, the coupling to the TLSs causes transient localization of the carriers analogous to the one recently found in the electron-boson scattering problem, featuring enhanced resistivities and displaced Drude peaks. Fast inelastic scatterers suppress localization, restoring a more conventional regime where transport and optical properties are governed by independent scattering events.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) magnets host a wide range of exotic magnetic textures, whose low-energy excitations and finite-temperature properties are typically described by effective spin models based on Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians. A key challenge in this framework is the reliable determination, from ab initio calculations, of exchange parameters and their anisotropic components, crucial for stabilising long-range order. Among the different strategies proposed for this task, the energy-mapping method -- based on total-energy calculations within Density Functional Theory (DFT) -- is the most widely adopted, but it typically requires laborious, multi-step procedures. To overcome this limitation, we introduce AMaRaNTA (Automating Magnetic paRAmeters iN a Tensorial Approach), a computational package that systematically automates the energy-mapping method, specifically through its ``four-state'' formulation, to extract exchange and anisotropy parameters in 2D magnets. In its current implementation, AMaRaNTA returns the nearest-neighbour exchange tensor, complemented by scalar parameters for second- and third-nearest-neighbour exchange interactions as well as single-ion anisotropy. Together, these provide a minimal yet sufficient set of parameters to capture magnetic frustration and anisotropies, essential for stabilising several observed magnetic states in 2D materials. Applied to a representative subset of the Materials Cloud 2D Structure database, AMaRaNTA demonstrates robust, automated and reproducible screening of magnetic interactions, with clear potential for high-throughput simulations.</p>

            <h2>Effects of correlated hopping on thermoelectric response of a quantum dot strongly coupled to ferromagnetic leads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kacper Wrześniewski, Ireneusz Weymann</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the impact of correlated hopping on thermoelectric transport through a quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads. Using the accurate numerical renormalization group method, we analyze the transport characteristics, focusing on the interplay between electronic correlations, spin-dependent transport processes, and thermoelectric response. We calculate the electrical conductance and thermopower as functions of the dot energy level, lead polarization, and the amplitude of correlated hopping. Moreover, we analyze the effect of competing correlations on the Kondo resonance and discuss the asymmetry of conductance peaks under the influence of the exchange field. We demonstrate that the presence of correlated hopping is responsible for asymmetric spin-dependent transport characteristics. Our results provide valuable insight into how correlated hopping affects spin-dependent transport and thermoelectric efficiency in quantum dot systems with ferromagnetic contacts.</p>

            <h2>Climbing the ladder: a method for identifying promising copper-lead apatites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ihor Sukhenko, Volodymyr Karbivskyy</p>
            <p>We develop a DFT screening procedure for copper-substituted lead apatites of the composition Pb$_9$Cu(XO$_4$)$_6$Y that enforces three design rules: thermodynamic stability, Cu site preference, and symmetry robustness of the near-Fermi electronic structure. A convex-hull analysis over P/V/As as X, O/F/Cl/Br as Y, identifies vanadates as the only members on or beneath the hull. Across the family, Cu substitution at Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($4f$) preserves flat bands at E$_F$, whereas Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($6h$) either gaps or severely distorts them. Small symmetry-lowering relaxations ($P3 \rightarrow P1$) are also capable of opening the band gap, motivating symmetry robustness as a filter. Applying these criteria singles out Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ (and, possibly, Cl$_2$) as leading candidates. This work motivates experimental study of the selected compounds, as well as a dedicated study of strong correlations.</p>

            <p>When neural networks are trained to classify a dataset, one finds a set of weights from which the network produces a label for each data point. We study the algorithmic complexity of finding a collision in a single-layer neural net, where a collision is defined as two distinct sets of weights that assign the same labels to all data. For binary perceptrons with oscillating activation functions, we establish the emergence of an overlap gap property in the space of collisions. This is a topological property believed to be a barrier to the performance of efficient algorithms. The hardness is supported by numerical experiments using approximate message passing algorithms, for which the algorithms stop working well below the value predicted by our analysis. Neural networks provide a new category of candidate collision resistant functions, which for some parameter setting depart from constructions based on lattices. Beyond relevance to cryptography, our work uncovers new forms of computational hardness emerging in large neural networks which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>Reaching a consensus on the superconducting order parameter of unconventional superconductors remains a central challenge in the field of magnetically-mediated superconductivity. Though UTe$_{2}$ is largely accepted as a rare example of an odd-parity superconductor, its precise order parameter remains highly debated, even at ambient conditions. A key underlying issue is the large sample-to-sample variation in superconducting properties at zero applied pressure and magnetic field. Here, we investigate the origin of the observed variation by means of single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements. Our results reveal highly ordered crystalline lattices, in agreement with the expected $Immm$ structure, and no signs of uranium vacancies. Tiny amounts of interstitial defects, however, are observed on the Te2 layers that host Te chains along the b axis. We argue that these defects give rise to slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD data and are enough to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_{2}$. Our findings highlight the need to focus future order parameter determination efforts on single crystals of UTe$_{2}$ with minimal amounts of structural disorder.</p>

            <p>Methods of elucidating the mechanisms of fast-ion conduction in solid-state materials are pivotal for advancements in energy technologies such as batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and supercapacitors. In this study, we examine the ionic conduction pathways in single crystal SrCl$_2$, which is a fast-ion conductor above 900~K, using four-dimensional Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (4D-QENS). We explore both coherent and incoherent neutron scattering at temperatures above the transition temperature into the superionic phase to explore the correlated motion of hopping anions. Refinements of the incoherent QENS yield residence times and jump probabilities between lattice sites in good agreement with previous studies, confirming that ionic hopping along nearest-neighbor directions is the most probable conduction pathway. However, the coherent QENS reveals evidence of de Gennes narrowing, indicating the importance of ionic correlations in the conduction mechanism. This highlights the need for improvements both in the theory of ionic transport in fluorite compounds and the modeling of coherent 4D-QENS in single crystals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Ceglie, Cosimo Mandriota, Giuseppe Carbone, Nicola Menga, Antoine Chateauminois</p>
            <p>We report on an experimental investigation of the interplay between friction, adhesion, contact geometry, and finite strains for smooth frictional contacts between rigid spherical glass probes and flat silicone substrates. Using both bulk and layer substrates under various loading conditions (normal force, radius of the probe), we show that shear-induced anisotropic shrinkage of the adhesive contact area under steady-state sliding is an effect of finite-elasticity conditions and is drastically affected by the level of geometric confinement. The resulting non-linear coupling between the normal and lateral directions is also investigated measuring the changes in the indentation depth (conv. normal load) during the stiction of the adhesive contacts under imposed normal load (conv. indentation depth) conditions, with strong effects of contact confinement. From a comparison with adhesiveless linear contact mechanics calculations, we show that the experimental observations can only be accounted for by the occurrence of finite strains/displacements conditions. Accordingly, measurements of the in-plane surface displacements at the surface of the rubber substrates confirm that strain levels well in the neo-Hookean range are experienced during steady-state frictional sliding.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Cassol, Léo Gaspard, Cyril Martins, Michele Casula, Benjamin Lenz</p>
            <p>As a consequence of their spin-orbit entangled ground state, many $5d^{5}$ iridate materials display a peculiar double peak structure in optical transport quantities, such as absorption and conductivity. Their common interpretation is based on the presence of Hubbard subbands in the half-filled $j_{\mathrm{eff}}=1/2$ manifold. Herein, we challenge this picture, proposing a scenario based on the presence of spin-polaron (SP) quasiparticles, and assigning a dominant SP character to the first peak. We illustrate it by taking the materials Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ as paradigmatic examples, which we investigate within the dynamical mean-field theory and the self-consistent Born approximation. Both theories reproduce nontrivial features revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and optical transport measurements, supporting our interpretation. In the case of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, we show how the SP scenario survives in the low-doped regime. Similar optical transport fingerprints are expected to be found in the wider class of $5d^5$ iridates and more generally in strongly correlated antiferromagnetic regimes, such as those found in cuprates.</p>

            <p>Geometric frustration can significantly increase the complexity and richness of many-body physics and, for instance, suppress antiferromagnetic order in quantum magnets. Here, we employ ultracold bosonic $^{39}$K atoms in a triangular optical lattice to study geometric frustration by stabilizing the gas at the frustrated upper band edge using negative absolute temperatures. We find that geometric frustration suppresses the critical interaction strength for the (chiral-)superfluid to Mott insulator ($\chi$-SF-MI) quantum phase transition by a factor of 2.7(3) and furthermore changes the critical dynamics of the transition. Although the emergence of coherence during fast ramps from MI to the ($\chi$-)SF regime is continuous in both cases, for ramps longer than a few tunnelling times, significant differences emerge. In the \frs case, no long-range order emerges on the studied timescales, highlighting a significantly reduced rate or even saturation of the emerging coherence. This work opens the door to quantum simulations of frustrated systems that are often intractable by classical simulations.</p>

            <h2>Chern classes of the multilayer fractional quantum Hall bundle on Riemann surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> María Abad Aldonza (UVSQ), Florent Dupont (IRMA)</p>
            <p>The so-called multilayer wave functions were introduced in the study of the fractional Quantum Hall effect by Halperin and others. They are defined with the help of a symmetric matrix $K$ in $M^k(\mathbb{N})$, which encodes the couplings between the $k$ layers where particles live. We study the multilayer quantum states in the case where each layer is a Riemann surface of genus $g$. These states form a vector bundle over the Jacobian variety of the Riemann surface, or the space of Aharonov-Bohm fluxes in physics terminology. Burban-Klevtsov have determined the rank and first Chern class of this bundle when $g=1$, and Klevtsov-Zvonkine computed the Chern character of this bundle in the single layer case for any genus. We generalize the latter approach to the multilayer case and compute the Chern character of the multilayer bundle for any genus, and any possible number of non-localized quasi-holes, under the assumption that the bilinear form associated to $K-I$ is non negative. The key tools are the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula, Berezin integration and Wick's formula for exterior algebras. We show that when all quasi-holes are localized, the Chern character is compatible with the bundle being projectively flat. Furthermore, for those configurations, the conductance becomes independent of the genus and is equal to the sum of the coefficients of the inverse matrix $K^{-1}$, proving two conjectures by Keski-Vakkuri and Wen. We also find the relation linking $K$, the genus of the surface, the magnetic field and the number of non-localized quasi holes in each layer, which was studied under the name of ''shift formula''. Finally, we study conditions on the matrix $K$ under which states having only localized quasi-holes maximize the total particle number, as well as the asymptotics for large magnetic fields in this scenario.</p>

            <p>We derive the exchange-driven growth (EDG) equations as the mean-field limit of interacting particle systems on the complete graph. Extending previous work, we consider symmetric exchange kernels $c(k, l) = c(l, k)$ satisfying super-linear bounds of the form $c(k, l) \leq C(k^{\mu}l^{\nu} + k^{\nu}l^{\mu})$, with $0 \leq \mu, \nu \leq 2$ and $\mu + \nu \leq 3$. Under these conditions the EDG equations are known to have global solutions. We establish a law of large numbers for the empirical measures, showing that the solutions of the EDG equation describe the limiting distribution of cluster sizes in the particle system. Furthermore, we analyse the dynamics of tagged particles and prove convergence to a time-inhomogeneous Markov process governed by a nonlinear master equation, derived via a law of large numbers for size-biased empirical processes.</p>

            <p>Complex networks are ubiquitous: a cell, the human brain, a group of people and the Internet are all examples of interconnected many-body systems characterized by macroscopic properties that cannot be trivially deduced from those of their microscopic constituents. Such systems are exposed to both internal, localized, failures and external disturbances or perturbations. Owing to their interconnected structure, complex systems might be severely degraded, to the point of disintegration or systemic dysfunction. Examples include cascading failures, triggered by an initially localized overload in power systems, and the critical slowing downs of ecosystems which can be driven towards extinction. In recent years, this general phenomenon has been investigated by framing localized and systemic failures in terms of perturbations that can alter the function of a system. We capitalize on this mathematical framework to review theoretical and computational approaches to characterize robustness and resilience of complex networks. We discuss recent approaches to mitigate the impact of perturbations in terms of designing robustness, identifying early-warning signals and adapting responses. In terms of applications, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art dismantling techniques, highlighting their optimal range of applicability for practical problems, and provide a repository with ready-to-use scripts, a much-needed tool set.</p>

            <p>Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harshit Sharma, Sashmita Rout, Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale</p>
            <p>We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model, having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$, these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r \rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S \rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some potential experimental realizations of our model.</p>

            <p>Multilayer networks provide a framework to study complex systems with multiple types of interactions, multiple dynamical processes, and/or multiple subsystems. When studying a dynamical process on a multilayer network, it is important to consider how both layer structure and heterogeneity across layers impacts the overall dynamics. As a concrete example, we study Ising dynamics on multilayer networks and investigate how network structure affects its qualitative features. We focus primarily on multiplex networks, which are multilayer networks in which interlayer edges occur only between manifestations of the same entity on different layers, although we also consider one empirical example with a more general multilayer structure. We use numerical simulations and a mean-field approximation to examine the steady-state behavior of the Ising dynamics as a function of temperature (which is a key model parameter) for a variety of two-layer multilayer networks from both models and empirical data. We examine both the steady-state behavior and a metastable state in which the two layers are anti-aligned, and we explore the effects of interlayer coupling strength and structural heterogeneity. In synthetic multilayer networks with core--periphery structure, we show that interlayer edges that involve peripheral nodes can exert more influence than interlayer edges that involve only core nodes. Finally, we consider empirical multilayer networks from biological and social systems. Our work illustrates how heterogeneity across the layers of a multilayer network influences dynamics on the whole network.</p>

            <p>A microfluidic approach to probing the first normal stress difference from single-point pressure measurements in pulsatile shear flows is presented. Using an original experimental design, we examine the near-zero-mean pulsatile flow of polymeric solutions in a straight, deformable microchannel at low Reynolds and Womersley numbers. An important aspect of this work is that the enhanced fluid elastic stresses can be efficiently determined via the pressure shift from pressure-controlled large-amplitude pulsatile shear experiments. We find a scaling law that collapses pressure-shift data from viscoelastic fluids of different molecular weights onto a single master curve that can then be used to predict this phenomenology. Taken together, these results could help shed light on our understanding of the non-linear normal stress responses in time-dependent flows.</p>

These zeros, arising from transitions between symmetry sectors, obey the Lee-Yang theorem and give rise to fidelity edges near critical points. Quantum criticality is further characterized through the finite-size scaling of fidelity zeros. As concrete examples, we analytically and numerically investigate fidelity zeros in one- and two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising models under a complex magnetic field.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prabhat Karmakar, Sayan Gupta, Ilaksh Adlakha</p>
            <p>Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation (xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results across representative material systems, including two phase composites and single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary, xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Run Hou, Shouvik Sur, Lucas K. Wagner, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy</p>
            <p>Despite much theoretical work, developing a comprehensive ab initio model for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has proven challenging due to the inherent trade-off between accurately describing the band structure and incorporating the interactions within the Hamiltonian, particularly given the topological obstruction -- so-called fragile topology -- to the description of the model in terms of localized symmetric Wannier functions within the flat band manifold. Here, we circumvent this obstruction by using an extended 8-orbital model, for which localized Wannier orbitals have been formulated by Carr et al. [1]. We constructed an extended multi-orbital Hubbard model, and performed Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations to explore its phase diagram across commensurate fillings from -3 to 3. We found several nearly-degenerate insulating states at charge neutrality, all of which exhibit orbital orders. Crucially, TBG near magic angle is known to be particle-hole asymmetric, which is naturally captured by the single-particle band structure of our model and is reflected in the distinction between the symmetry broken states obtained at electron and hole dopings away from the charge neutral point. At filling -1 and +2, quantum anomalous hall states are obtained, while for the rest of the integer fillings away from charge neutrality, we found the system to realize metallic states with various orbital, valley and spin orderings. We also observed that most of the Hartree--Fock ground states exhibit a generalized valley Hund's-like rule, resulting in valley polarization. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of the intra-valley and inter-valley exchange interactions is crucial to properly stabilize the ordered symmetry-broken states. In agreement with experiments, we find significant particle-hole asymmetry, which underscores the importance of using particle-hole asymmetric models.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian Fractional Chern Insulators and Competing States in Flat Moiré Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Liu, Zhao Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz</p>
            <p>Breakthrough experiments have recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moiré materials. However, all states observed are Abelian, the possible existence of more exotic non-Abelian FCIs remains controversial both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we investigate the competition between charge density wave (CDW) order, gapless composite fermion liquid (CFL), and non-Abelian Moore-Read states at half-filling of a moiré band. Although groundstate (quasi-)degeneracies and spectral flow are not sufficient for distinguishing between charge order and Moore-Read states, we find evidence using entanglement spectroscopy that both these states of matter can be realized with Coulomb interactions. By further analyzing the graviton excitations of Moore-Read states, we unveil that the ground states exhibit a mixed behavior of Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian, despite the weak breaking of particle-hole symmetry. In a double twisted bilayer graphene model, transitions between these phases can be driven by the coupling strength between the layers: at weak coupling there is a CFL phase and at strong coupling a CDW order emerges. Remarkably, however, there is compelling evidence for a non-Abelian Moore-Read FCI phase at intermediate coupling.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamics of pulsating active liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tirthankar Banerjee, Thibault Desaleux, Jonas Ranft, Étienne Fodor</p>
            <p>Inspired by dense contractile tissues, where cells are subject to periodic deformation, we formulate and study a generic hydrodynamic theory of pulsating active liquids. Combining mechanical and phenomenological arguments, we postulate that the mechanochemical feedback between the local phase, which describes how cells deform due to autonomous driving, and the local density can be described in terms of a free energy. We demonstrate that such a feedback is compatible with the coarse-graining of a broad class of microscopic models. Our hydrodynamics captures the three main states emerging in its particle-based counterparts: a globally cycling state, a homogeneous arrested state with constant phase, and a state with propagating radial waves. Remarkably, we show that the competition between these states can be rationalized intuitively in terms of an effective landscape, and argue that waves can be regarded as secondary instabilities. Linear stability analysis of the arrested and cycling states, including the role of fluctuations, leads to predictions for the phase boundaries. Overall, our results demonstrate that our minimal, yet non-trivial model provides a relevant platform to study the rich phenomenology of pulsating liquids.</p>

            <h2>Entropic Clustering of Stickers Induces Aging in Biocondensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Le Roy, Paolo De Los Rios</p>
            <p>Biomolecular condensates are cellular phase-separated droplets that usually exhibit a viscoelastic mechanical response. A behavior rationalized by modeling the complex molecules that make up a condensate as stickers and spacers, which assemble into a network-like structure. Condensates usually exhibit a solidification over a long period of time (days), a phenomenon described as this http URL emergence of such a long timescale of evolution from microscopic processes, as well as the associated microscopic reorganization leading to aging, remains mostly an open question. In this article, we explore the connection between the mechanical properties of the condensates and their microscopic structure. We propose a minimal model for the dynamic of stickers and spacers, and show that entropy maximization of spacers leads to an attractive force between stickers. Our system displays a surprisingly slow relaxation toward equilibrium, reminiscent of glassy systems and consistent with the liquid-to-solid transition observed. To explain this behavior, we study the clustering dynamic of stickers and successfully explain the origin of glassy relaxation.</p>

            <h2>Interaction dependence of the Hall response for the Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Halati, Thierry Giamarchi</p>
            <p>We explore the behavior of the Hall response of a Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder in a magnetic field as a function of the repulsive on-site atomic interactions. We consider a wide range of interaction strengths, from the weakly interacting limit to the hardcore regime. This is realized by computing the Hall polarization following the quench of a weak linear potential which induces the flow of a current through the system, using time-dependent matrix product state numerical simulations. We complement our understanding in the regime of small magnetic fields by analytical calculations of the equilibrium value of the Hall polarization for non-interacting bosonic atoms, or under a mean-field assumption. The Bose-Hubbard triangular flux ladder exhibits a rich phase diagram, containing Meissner, vortex and biased-chiral superfluid phases. We show that the Hall response can be employed to fingerprint the various chiral state, the frustration effects occurring in the limit of strong interactions, and the phase boundaries of the equilibrium phase diagram.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium Fluctuation-Response Relations for State Observables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Timur Aslyamov, Massimiliano Esposito</p>
            <p>Time-integrated state observables, which quantify the fraction of time spent by the system in a specific pool of states, are important in many fields, such as chemical sensing or the theory of fluorescence spectroscopy. We derive exact identities, called Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs), that connect the fluctuations of such observables to their response to external perturbations in nonequilibrium steady state of Markov jump processes. Using these results, we derive a first known upper bound on fluctuations of state observables, as well as some new lower bounds. We further demonstrate how our identities provide a deeper understanding of the mechanistic origin of fluctuations and reveal their properties dependent only on system topology, which may be relevant for model inference using measured data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eka Nurfani, Aldi Saputra, Novalia Pertiwi, Muhamad F. Arif</p>
            <p>In this paper, Ni-doped ZnO films were grown on a p-type silicon substrate via spray pyrolysis. The Ni dopant concentrations were varied by adjusting the weight ratio between Zinc Acetate Dehydrate (ZAD) and Nickel Chloride Hexahydrate (NCH), resulting in the ZnO, ZnO:Ni1%, and ZnO:Ni3% samples. Field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images revealed that Ni doping significantly reduced the nanostructure size from 326 nm (ZnO) to 146 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Similarly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also shows the decrease of the crystallite size with increasing Ni doping, from 44 nm (ZnO) to 35 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were conducted at a bias voltage of 0 and 5 V to examine electrical and self-powered photodetection properties. All samples demonstrate self-powered photodetector performance. At the bias of 0 V, the undoped ZnO exhibited a higher photo-to-dark-current ratio (162) as compared to ZnO:Ni1% (18) and ZnO:Ni3% (16). The ZnO:Ni3% samples displayed faster rise (0.4 s) and fall times (1.7 s) as compared to the pure ZnO (10.8 s for rise time and 9.1 s for fall time), highlighting their potential for applications requiring rapid photoresponse. The findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the performance of ZnO-based photodetectors through controlled Ni doping, enabling advancements in self-powered photodetection technology for energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hans Christiansen, Max Geier, Brian M. Andersen, Andreas Kreisel</p>
            <p>The heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ is a candidate for hosting intrinsic spin-triplet superconductivity. At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of a time-periodic drive on three-dimensional Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals in planar-Hall/planar-thermal-Hall set-ups. The drive is modelled here by circularly-polarized electromagnetic fields, whose effects are incorporated by a combination of the Floquet theorem and the van Vleck perturbation theory, applicable in the high-frequency limit. We evaluate the longitudinal and in-plane transverse components of the linear-response coefficients using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, thereby demonstrating the explicit analytical expressions of the conductivity for large frequencies. Our results corroborate the fact that the topological charges of the corresponding semimetals etch their trademark signatures in these transport properties, which can be detected in appropriate experiments.</p>

            <h2>Neodymium ions as charge reservoir in NdNiO$_2$: from lack of long range order to electron-doping-induced antiferromagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Kłosiński, Roman Drachynskyi, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Wojciech Brzezicki</p>
            <p>We study magnetism in the electron-doped infinite-layer nickelate NdNiO$_2$. We perform an unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculation for a tight-binding model which contains both nickel and neodymium orbitals. We reproduce the self-doping effect, which is the escape of charge onto the neodymium bands. By fixing all free parameters to realistic values we find that undoped NdNiO$_2$ lies right {\it outside} the antiferromagnetic (AFM) region of the phase diagram. This is consistent with experiments, which find no long-range order in the ground state of NdNiO$_2$, yet see short-range AFM correlations and broad magnetic excitations. We also find that the self-doping effect leads to a dramatic increase in the stability of the AFM solution upon electron doping -- a behavior that is strikingly different from what is, for instance, observed in the cuprates. Finally, for smaller charge transfer energies than suggested for NdNiO$_2$, the self-doping effect may be quite strong and stabilise various stripe configurations already on the mean-field level.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Argüello-Luengo, Alejandro González-Tudela, J. Ignacio Cirac</p>
            <p>Here, we propose a platform based on ultra-cold fermionic molecules trapped in optical lattices to simulate nonadiabatic effects, as they appear in certain molecular dynamical problems. The idea consists of a judicious choice of two rotational states as the simulated electronic or nuclear degrees of freedom, in which their dipolar interactions induce the required attractive or repulsive interactions between them. We benchmark our proposal by studying the scattering of an electron or a proton against a hydrogen atom, showing the effect of electronic exchange and inelastic ionization as the mass ratio between the simulated nuclei and electrons -- a tunable experimental parameter in our simulator -- becomes comparable. These benchmarks illustrate how the simulator can qualitatively emulate phenomena like those appearing in molecular dynamical problems even if the simulated interaction occurs in two-dimensions with a dipolar scaling. Beyond the molecular implementation proposed here, our proposal can be readily extrapolated to other atomic platforms, e.g., based on fermionic Rydberg atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heiko Georg Menzler, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner</p>
            <p>We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.</p>

The VPM combines a conventional pulse magnet and a vector magnet. The VPM can create vector pulsed magnetic fields and swiftly rotating pulsed magnetic fields. As a demonstration, the three-dimensional magnetoresistance measurement of a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is carried out using the AC four-probe method at 4.5 K and 6 T. The two-dimensional electronic structure of graphite is visualized in the three-dimensional magnetoresistance data. One can uncover the rotational and time-reversal symmetry of materials using a VPM and a variety of measurement techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nayana Venkatareddy, Mohd Moid, Prabal K. Maiti, Biman Bagchi</p>
            <p>A quantitative relationship between the diffusion coefficient $D$ of a tagged particle in a liquid and the entropy $S$ of that liquid has long been sought, as it would allow entropy to be inferred directly from diffusion measurements and transport properties to be predicted from thermodynamic information. Here, we employ extensive computer simulations to independently compute both $D$ and $S$ for Lennard-Jones (LJ) liquids and for water across a wide range of thermodynamic state points. Our study covers two and three dimensions for both systems, and additionally explores one-dimensional confinement for water. We find that the ratio of diffusion coefficients between two states follows an almost perfect exponential dependence on their entropy difference. For LJ liquids, the exponential prefactor exhibits a pronounced dependence on dimensionality $d$, consistent in trend but quantitatively distinct from theoretical predictions. In contrast, water shows a strikingly weak dimensionality $d$ dependence, deviating from theory, which we attribute to the dominant role of jump diffusion. Remarkably, the exponential diffusion-entropy relationship persists even when translational and rotational contributions to entropy are separated and considered individually. This robustness suggests that entropy provides a unifying measure governing particle mobility in liquids, largely independent of microscopic mechanisms or dimensional constraints.</p>

            <p>Hydrophobic interactions are central to biological self-assembly and soft matter organization, yet their microscopic origins remain debated. A key hallmark is the strengthening of attraction between hydrophobic solutes with increasing temperature, a feature often attributed to entropy changes from disrupted hydrogen bonding in water. Here we present an alternative framework based on surface phase behavior, supported by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Using metadynamics, we quantify the solvent-mediated effective potential between nanometer-scale hydrophobic solutes in the monatomic water (mW) model, the SPCE water model, and a Lennard-Jones solvent. We develop a morphometric model which incorporates a scaling theory of critical drying, linking the range and strength of hydrophobic attraction to interfacial thermodynamics and proximity to vapor-liquid coexistence. The model reproduces the effective potential across diverse solute sizes, degrees of hydrophobicity, and thermodynamic states. Our simulations recover the inverse temperature dependence of hydrophobicity, showing it arises generically from rapid thermal expansion of the solvation shell.</p>

            <p>Grain boundaries facet due to anisotropic grain boundary energies: While the faceted boundary has a larger area than the corresponding straight boundary, a significantly lower energy of the facets compared to a straight segment can drive the faceting. This picture is complicated by faceting/defaceting transitions where the free energy difference between the two states depends on the temperature. Such transitions have been observed and modeled before, but their exact nature was not fully understood. Here, we use atomistic computer simulations to show that a well known faceting transition in $\Sigma 3$ [111] tilt grain boundaries in Al is in fact a grain boundary phase transition (also called complexion transition). This means that the faceted and defaceted boundaries are associated with different atomic structures, which have different thermodynamic stability ranges. At low temperatures, the grain boundary phase associated with faceting is stable, while at high temperatures the flat grain boundary phase is stable. We also report on our thorough tests of Al interatomic potentials for this purpose, which include comparisons to density-functional theory calculations. Our chosen potential performs well for our grain boundaries. As a consequence we were able to obtain results that align with previous experimental results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marceau Hénot</p>
            <p>Dielectric spectra are typically obtained in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by analyzing the fluctuations, in the absence of an applied electric field, of the total dipole moment of the simulation box. We compare this standard method with a protocol that focuses on a virtual cavity whose size is chosen to include short-range dipolar cross-correlations, while excluding long-range correlations that are affected by the choice of electrostatic boundary conditions. We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods. We propose that, for a liquid with a sufficiently high dielectric permittivity, the cavity protocol yields a self-spectrum consistent with the electrostatic boundary conditions applicable to the experimental situation.</p>

            <p>In this work, we identify the local structural defects that control the non-affine displacement fields in jammed disk packings subjected to athermal, quasistatic (AQS) simple shear. While complex non-affine displacement fields typically occur during simple shear, isolated effective quadrupoles are also observed and their probability increases with increasing pressure. We show that the emergence of an isolated effective quadrupole requires the breaking of an interparticle contact that is aligned with low-frequency, spatially extended vibrational modes. Since the Eshelby inhomogeneity problem gives rise to quadrupolar displacement fields in continuum materials, we reformulate and implement Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method (EIM) for jammed disk packings. Using EIM, we show that we can reconstruct the non-affine displacement fields for jammed disk packings in response to applied shear as a sum of discrete Eshelby-like defects that are caused by mismatches in the local stiffnesses of triangles formed from Delaunay triangulation of the disk centers.</p>

            <p>Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range \( 0 < H < 1 \). Here we extend this definition to the regime \( -1/2 < H < 0 \). The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The resulting process is both very rough and persistent, that is long-range positively correlated. In addition, this process is stationary. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also study another closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range \( -1/2 < H < 0 \) and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for \( -1/2 < H < 0 \). In the marginal case \( H = 0 \), our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.</p>

            <h2>Ferromagnetic and Spin-Glass Finite-Temperature Order but no Antiferromagnetic Order in the d=1 Ising Model with Long-Range Power-Law Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Can Artun, A. Nihat Berker</p>
            <p>The d=1 Ising ferromagnet and spin glass with long-range power-law interactions J r^-a is studied for all interaction range exponents a by a renormalization-group transformation that simultaneously projects local ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In the ferromagnetic case, J>0, a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase occurs for interaction range 0.74<a<2. The second-order phase transition temperature monotonically decreases between these two limits. At a=2, the phase transition becomes first order, as predicted by rigorous results. For a>2, the phase transition temperature discontinuously drops to zero and for a>2 there is no ordered phase above zero temperature, also as predicted by rigorous results. At the other end, on approaching a=0.74 from above, namely increasing the range of the interaction, the phase transition temperature diverges to infinity, meaning that, at all non-infinite temperatures, the system is ferromagnetically ordered. Thus, the equivalent-neighbor interactions regime is entered before (a > 0) the neighbors become equivalent, namely before the interactions become equal for all separations. The critical exponents alpha,beta, gamma,delta,eta,nu are calculated, from a large recursion matrix, varying as function of a. For antiferromagnetic J<0, all triplets of spins at all ranges have competing interactions and this highly frustrated system does not have an ordered phase. In the spin-glass system, where all couplings for all separations are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic (with probability p), a finite-temperatures spin-glass phase is obtained in the absence of antiferromagnetic phase. In the spin-glass phase, the signature chaotic behavior under scale change occurs in a richer version than previously: In the long-range interaction of this system, the interactions at every separation become chaotic, yielding a piecewise chaotic interaction function.</p>

            <p>Thermodynamic irreversibility is a fundamental concept in statistical physics, yet its experimental measurement remains challenging, especially for complex systems. We introduce a novel random coarse-graining framework to identify model-free measures of irreversibility in complex many-body systems. These measures are constructed from the asymmetry of cross-correlation functions between suitably chosen observables, providing rigorous lower bounds on entropy production. For many-particle systems, we propose a particularly practical implementation that divides real space into virtual boxes and monitors particle number densities within them, requiring only simple counting from video microscopy, without single-particle tracking, trajectory reconstruction, or prior knowledge of interactions. Owing to its generality and minimal data requirements, the random coarse-graining framework offers broad applicability across diverse nonequilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>Atom-surface interaction induced by quenched monopolar charge disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing-Sui Lu</p>
            <p>We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk (surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material, finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning Time Propagators for Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karan Shah, Attila Cangi</p>
            <p>Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a machine learning approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials by utilizing fast machine learning predictions in a large space of varying experimental parameters of the laser.</p>

            <h2>Energy dependent Chemical Interface Damping induced by 1-Decanethiol Self-Assembled Monolayer on Au(111)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maurice Pfeiffer, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Jacob B. Khurgin, Olga Matts, Ahmed Shqer, Nadiia Mameka, Manfred Eich, Alexander Petrov</p>
            <p>The chemical interface damping (CID) effect increases the collision frequency of free electrons in metals by changes of the metal surface. We have now experimentally disentangled the two contributions to CID: induced roughness and direct charge transfer. The latter is an important area of research in photoelectrochemistry with potential applications in light-induced chemical reactions. We present a broadband investigation of the CID effect on Au(111) covered by a self-assembled monolayer of decanethiol. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements show a photon energy dependent increase of collision frequency. We observe a constant, photon energy independent contribution, which is attributed to induced roughness and a contribution that linearly increases with photon energy from about 1 eV upwards which we attribute to direct charge transfer. The onset of the charge transfer mechanism corresponds to occupied orbitals of thiols bound to the Au surface, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations.</p>

            <h2>Correlation Matrix Method for Phonon Quasiparticles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjing Li, Yong Lu, Fawei Zheng</p>
            <p>Phonon anharmonicity is ubiquitous in real materials and is crucial for understanding thermal properties and phase stability. In this work, we show that anharmonic phonon modes can be obtained by maximizing their lifetimes during fitting the atomic trajectory. We prove that all information about these quasiparticles is contained in two small correlation matrices $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, which can be constructed directly from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on these matrices, we proposed an optimization scheme, which allows us to efficiently determine temperature-dependent phonon modes along with their frequencies and lifetimes. We verified this method by applying it to silicon and cubic CaSiO$_3$, where it successfully captured their temperature-dependent phonon behaviors and the well-known phonon softening in cubic CaSiO$_3$. This theory provides a convenient tool for investigating phonon quasiparticles and can be extended to study other quasiparticles, such as electrons, holes, and magnons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Shujie Cheng, Gao Xianlong</p>
            <p>We study a one-dimensional quasiperiodic tight-binding model with simultaneous off-diagonal (hopping) and diagonal (onsite) modulations. Using the inverse participation ratio and the wave-packet centroid, we construct localization-delocalization phase diagrams for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states. We analyze the robustness of initial-state properties under dissipation and characterize dissipation-induced localization-delocalization transitions (and their reversals) in detail. Trace-distance dynamics provide evidence for a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared farther from the steady state can relax faster than states initialized closer to it. We propose a starting-line hypothesis that explains the presence or absence of this effect across parameter regimes. In addition, we examine thermodynamic functionality and find that the localized phase favors the realization of quantum heaters. These results advance the understanding of steady-state phase transitions and relaxation dynamics in dissipatively driven quasiperiodic systems, and broaden the thermodynamic landscape of quasiperiodic platforms.</p>

            <p>We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.</p>

            <h2>A General Model for Static Contact Angles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos E Colosqui</p>
            <p>The problem of contact angle and hysteresis determination has direct implications for engineering applications of wetting, colloid and surface science. Significant technical challenges can arise under real-world operating conditions, because the static contact angle is strongly influenced by contamination at the liquid-solid and liquid-vapor interfaces, chemical aging over long times, and environmental variables such as relative humidity and temperature. Analytical models that account for these real-world effects are therefore highly desirable to guide the rational design of robust applications. This work proposes a unified and simple-to-use model that expands Young's local thermodynamic approach to consider surfaces with topographic features of general geometry and varying degrees of liquid infiltration. The unified model recovers classical wetting limits (Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter, and hemiwicking), accounts for observable intermediate states (e.g., impregnating Cassie), and identifies a new limiting state with potential realizability: a Cassie state accompanied by a precursor film, termed the Inverse Wenzel state.</p>

            <h2>Competing Supramolecular Structures: Dielectric and Rheological Spectroscopy on Glycerol/Propanol Mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Philipp Gabriel</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding the dynamics of pure hydrogen-bonded systems by analyzing the spectral shape of various susceptibilities. Monohydroxy- and polyalcohols are currently considered to form transient supramolecular hydrogen-bonded structures in the form of chains, rings, and networks. This complex dynamic behavior has been identified in network-forming glycerol and chain-forming propanol by combining dielectric and light-scattering spectra. We apply these concepts to study the combined dielectric and shear rheological spectral shape of glycerol/propanol mixtures. Glycerol differs from propanol by having two additional hydroxy groups, which leads to significant differences in melting temperatures($\Delta T_{\textbf{m}}$\,=\,291\,K\,-\,147\,K\,=\,143\,K) and glass transition temperatures ($\Delta T_{\textbf{g}}$\,=\,190\,K-\,98\,K\,=\,92\,K). The strong difference results in two distinct calorimetric glass transitions at a molar glycerol concentration of $\chi_{gly}=0.3$, as well as a change in the shear modulus $G_{\infty}$ between $\chi_{gly}=0.5$ and 0.7. Performing a comprehensive analysis of the three applied experimental techniques leads to the conclusion that dielectric spectroscopy monitors the evolution of supramolecular chain and network structures and that the mechanical properties depend heavily on the formed hydrogen-bonded network. A strong dynamical heterogeneity is observed and manifests itself in two distinguishable glass transitions in dielectric spectroscopy and calorimetry. The presented chain/network mixture is dynamically highly heterogeneous when compared to the rather narrow dynamical heterogeneity in the network/network mixture Water/Glycerol.</p>

            <p>We report ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) exhibiting a high breakdown field (> 5.3 MV/cm) and a low contact resistance (~1.55 {\Omega}mm), tailored for high-power radiofrequency applications. A split-doped barrier architecture, employing two distinct doping concentrations, is shown to enhance both the breakdown field and contact resistance. This design enables a state-of-the-art combination of maximum drain current (487 mA/mm) and breakdown field, along with a high cutoff frequency of 7.2 GHz. These results demonstrate a viable pathway to push device performance toward the material limits while minimizing contact resistance in UWBG AlGaN HFETs, paving the way for next-generation high-power, high-frequency applications.</p>

            <h2>Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naïmo Davier, Ludovic D.C. Jaubert</p>
            <p>Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</p>

            <p>We have fabricated three-dimensional (3D) networks of ultrathin carbon nanotubes (CNTs) within the ~5-Angstrom diameter pores of zeolite ZSM-5 crystals using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process. The 1D electronic characteristics of ultrathin CNTs are characterized by van Hove singularities in the density of states. Boron doping was strategically employed to tune the Fermi energy near a van Hove singularity, which is supported by extensive ab-initio calculations, while the 3D network structure ensures the formation of a phase-coherent bulk superconducting state under a 1D to 3D crossover. We report characteristic signatures of superconductivity using four complementary experimental methods: magnetization, specific heat, resistivity, and point-contact spectroscopy, all consistently support a critical temperature Tc at ambient conditions ranging from 220 to 250 K. In particular, point-contact spectroscopy revealed a multigap nature of superconductivity with a large ~30 meV leading gap, in rough agreement with the prediction of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity. The differential conductance response displays a particle-hole symmetry and is tuneable between the tunnelling and Andreev limits via the transparency of the contact, as uniquely expected for a superconductor. Preliminary experiments also reveal a giant pressure effect which increases the Tc above the ambient temperature.</p>

            <h2>Accelerating Quantum Relaxation via Temporary Reset: A Mpemba-Inspired Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruicheng Bao, Zhonghuai Hou</p>
            <p>Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a protocol that enables significant acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems by temporarily coupling the system to a reset channel, inspired by the Mpemba effect. Crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol may suppress multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.</p>

            <h2>Potential renormalisation, Lamb shift and mean-force Gibbs state -- to shift or not to shift?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis A. Correa, Jonas Glatthard</p>
            <p>Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is, in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can yield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system folklore regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified.</p>

            <p>The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</p>

            <p>Non-stabilizerness is a key resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet its interplay with entanglement in dynamical settings remains underexplored. We address this by analyzing a well-controlled, analytically tractable setup, where we show that entanglement acts as a conduit that teleports magic across the system, thereby enhancing magic injection. Using exact calculations, we prove that when a Haar-random unitary $U_A$ is applied to a subsystem $A$ of an entangled stabilizer state, the total injected magic increases with the entanglement between $A$ and its complement. More generally, for any unitary $U_A$, we show that this enhancement is maximized when $A$ is maximally entangled with its complement, in which case the total injected magic is exactly given by the unitary stabilizer Rényi entropy we introduce. This quantity provides both a directly computable measure of unitary magic and a lower bound on the minimum number of $T$ gates required to synthesize $U_A$. We further extend our analysis to tripartite stabilizer entanglement, non-stabilizer entanglement, and magic injection via shallow-depth brickwork circuits, finding that the qualitative picture remains unchanged.</p>

            <p>Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar Czochralski growth, a novel method for programming the quasi-monocrystalline growth of low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure uniform crystalline properties across large areas is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.</p>

            <p>The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.</p>

            <p>Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires complex copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligomers that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even at mutation rates expected under prebiotic conditions.</p>

            <p>The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states. We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</p>

            <p>The vibrational response of polymer networks under load provides a sensitive probe of molecular deformation and a route to non-destructive diagnostics. Here we show that machine-learned force fields reproduce these spectroscopic fingerprints with quantum-level fidelity in realistic epoxy thermosets. Using MACE-OFF23 molecular dynamics, we capture the experimentally observed redshifts of para-phenylene stretching modes under tensile load, in contrast to the harmonic OPLS-AA model. These shifts correlate with molecular elongation and alignment, consistent with Badger's rule, directly linking vibrational features to local stress. To capture IR intensities, we trained a symmetry-adapted dipole moment model on representative epoxy fragments, enabling validation of strain responses. Together, these approaches provide chemically accurate and computationally accessible predictions of strain-dependent vibrational spectra. Our results establish vibrational fingerprints as predictive markers of mechanical state in polymer networks, pointing to new strategies for stress mapping and structural-health diagnostics in advanced materials.</p>

The electronic phase transition is accompanied by anomalies in the magnetic ordering temperature and the anomalous Hall conductivity, which peak at or near the critical pressure of the IMT. We perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations as a function of pressure to reveal the driving factors behind the IMT and the magnetic anomalies in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. We extract Heisenberg Hamiltonians as a function of pressure based on our DFT calculations. Our classical Monte Carlo simulations for these Hamiltonians yield ordering temperatures and magnetic ordering patterns, in agreement with the experimental data. Although we can accurately explain the evolution of magnetism with pressure, it seems that the anomalous Hall conductivity in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ cannot be accounted for by intrinsic contributions alone.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunghoon Kim</p>
            <p>Motivated by recent advances in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moiré materials, we propose TMD moiré multilayers as a platform for realizing an approximately SU(4)-symmetric triangular Kondo lattice, generalizing the concept of the double quantum dot model. Our model extends the conventional Kondo lattice by incorporating a three-site exchange of SU(4) local moments, which drives spontaneous time-reversal and lattice symmetry breaking. Using a parton mean-field approach, we map out the phase diagram as a function of three-site exchange and hole doping. In the Kondo-unscreened regime, we identify Mott insulating phases, including bond-ordered states and a chiral spin liquid. With increasing doping, Kondo hybridization gives rise to a heavy Fermi liquid that exhibits distinct patterns of lattice symmetry breaking, with or without topological responses. We conclude with directions for future study.</p>

            <h2>Localization and topological signatures under periodic twisting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Walkling, Antonio Štrkalj, F. Nur Ünal</p>
            <p>We theoretically explore a dynamical generalization of the Aubry-André model in two dimensions formed by superimposing two square-lattice potentials. Motivated by the rich physics emerging at different twist angles between the two lattices at equilibrium, we introduce periodic twisting by continuously rotating one of the lattices with respect to the other in the plane. We demonstrate that the distinct time-dependent twisting in this system gives rise to an intricate form of periodic multi-frequency driving that changes with the distance from the rotation axis. We find that the incommensurate nature of the potential no longer plays the pivotal role as it does in the static case. Rather, the tunneling can be understood in terms of a local, spatially varying dynamical localization effect, which we show to yield ring-shaped states localized within the bulk that have interesting transport signatures. Quantifying the eigenstates with the Bott index and local Chern marker, we find that there is a zoo of states with non-trivial topological signatures, the most ubiquitous of which result in relatively uniform ring-shaped regions of the Chern marker. We investigate the origin of these effects from various angles and identify that hybridization between different delocalized ring states plays a vital role. Lastly, we discuss possible experimental realizations in quantum simulation settings. Our results open a new avenue of investigation with periodic twisting inducing a spatially varying multi-frequency drive.</p>

            <h2>Obtaining the Spectral Function of Moiré Graphene Heavy-Fermions Using Iterative Perturbation Theory</h2>

            <p>The spectral functions of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) in the absence of strain have recently been investigated in both the symmetric and symmetry-broken phases using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The theoretically predicted Mott-Hubbard bands and gapless semimetallic state at half-filling have since been confirmed experimentally. Here, we develop several second-order perturbation theory approaches to the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model of TBG and twisted symmetric trilayer graphene (TSTG). In the symmetric phase, we adapt, implement, and benchmark an iterative perturbation theory (IPT) impurity solver within DMFT, enabling computationally efficient yet accurate spectral function calculations. We present momentum- and energy-resolved spectra over a broad range of temperatures and fillings for both symmetric and symmetry-broken states. In addition, we derive analytic expressions for the spectral function within the ``Hubbard-I'' approximation of the THF model and, as expected, find that while it provides a tractable description of Mott physics, it does not capture the low-energy Kondo peak or the finite lifetime broadening of the bands. Our methodology can be extended to include strain, lattice relaxation, and parameter variations, thereby allowing systematic predictions of TBG and TSTG spectral properties across a wide range of physical regimes. Because our perturbative approaches are far less computationally intensive than DMFT with numerically exact impurity solvers, they can be used to efficiently benchmark and scan extensive phase diagrams of the THF parameters, paving the way for full DMFT analyses of the TBG spectral function in the presence of strain and relaxation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saranyo Moitra, Inti Sodemann Villadiego</p>
            <p>We investigate the fate of Laughlin's wave-function in ideal Chern bands which can be mapped to generalized zero Landau levels in spatially dependent magnetic fields. By exploiting its exact mapping onto a classical Coulomb gas and leveraging previous results of one-component plasmas in nonuniform neutralizing backgrounds, we demonstrate that the ideal Laughlin wave-function undergoes a phase transition from its well-known fully gapped topologically ordered plasma state into a power-law correlated dielectric state even for the fixed filling of $1/3$, as the magnetic field becomes increasingly more inhomogeneous. This dielectric state is gapless even though it does not spontaneously break translational symmetry. Remarkably, for a fixed filling $\nu=1/m$, the exponent governing density correlations in this state changes continuously as a function of the degree of spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field, and can range from $4$ near a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to the plasma state, up to $2 m$ in the limit of fields generated by point solenoids.</p>

            <p>The stabilization of long-range magnetic order in nominally non-magnetic semi- conductors using femtosecond light pulses is an exciting yet experimentally challenging goal. Theoretical studies indicate that certain non-magnetic semi- conductors can exhibit transient magnetic instabilities following above-gap laser excitation, but the dynamical pathways leading to these states remain largely unexplored. In this work, I introduce a minimal real-time spin-orbital model and identify the fundamental microscopic mechanisms that enable the emergence of a transient magnetic order. I then discuss the relevance of these findings for real materials employing a phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg- Landau model. Finally, I analyze the strengths and limitations of current first-principles methodologies for investigating dynamically induced broken- symmetry states in the light of the present results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evelyna Wang, Marco-Tulio F. Rodrigues, Baris Key</p>
            <p>The use of Si anodes can greatly improve the energy density of Li-ion batteries. However, understanding and mitigation of calendar aging remains a barrier to commercialization. In this short report, we utilize operando Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect and quantify lithium silicides (LixSi) as they form and react within Si anodes in pouch cells during calendar aging. We provide direct experimental evidence of complex aging phenomena in the Si anodes, including both SEI growth and dissolution during storage. Formation of electrochemically isolated LixSi is also observed, as indicated by the partial persistence of highly lithiated phases after the cell is discharged. Remarkably, we show that these isolated domains can themselves self-discharge over time, suggesting that their detection can be challenging in post-mortem studies. Finally, we show that aging outcomes depend heavily on the type of silicon particles contained within the electrode, and that certain surface coatings can help decrease the reactivity between lithium silicides and the electrolyte.</p>

            <h2>Generation of pure, spin polarized, and unpolarized charge currents at the few cycle limit of circularly polarized light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepika Gill, Sangeeta Sharma, Sam Shallcross</p>
            <p>In certain members of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) family, laser pulses of oppositely circularly polarized light excite electrons of opposite spin. Here we show that in the few cycle limit such pulses generate not only a spin density excitation, but also a spin current excitation. Employing the example of the TMDC WSe$_2$ we show that pure spin currents, the flow of spin in the absence of net charge flow, 100% spin polarized currents, and charge currents are all accessible and controllable by tuning the amplitude of ~ 5 femtosecond gap tuned light pulses. Underpinning this physics is a symmetry lowering of the valley charge excitation from C3 at long duration to C2 in the few cycle limit, imbuing the excitation with net current. Our results both highlight the emergence of a rich light-spin current coupling at ultrafast times in the TMDC family, as well presenting a route to the all-optical generation of pure spin currents.</p>

            <h2>Localized Excitons and Landau-Level Mixing in Time-Reversal Symmetric Pairs of Chern Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guopeng Xu, Nemin Wei, Inti Sodemann Villadiego, Chunli Huang</p>
            <p>We study Landau-level mixing in a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian composed of two sets of Landau levels with opposite magnetic field, relevant to moiré minibands in twisted homobilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides in the adiabatic limit, where electrons in opposite valleys have flat Chern bands with opposite Chern numbers. Strong spin-orbit coupling polarizes spins in opposite directions in opposite valleys, separating Coulomb interactions into like-spin ($V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$) and opposite-spin ($V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$). Using degenerate perturbation theory, we compute Landau-level mixing corrections to $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$ and $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ for different filling fractions. In the lowest Landau level, screening exhibits an even-odd effect: $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$ is reduced more strongly than $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ in even-$m$ angular momentum Haldane pseudopotential and less strongly in odd-$m$ angular momentum ones. In the first Landau level, the short-range part ($m=0,1$) of $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ is reduced comparably to $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$, while the strongest spin anisotropy appears in the $m=2$ pseudopotential. These novel short-range spin correlations have important implications for candidate correlated phases of fractional quantum spin Hall insulators. A distinctive feature of this time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian, absent in conventional quantum Hall systems, is that spin-flip excitations form localized quasiparticles. We compute their excitation spectrum and predict a non-monotonic dependence of the ordering temperature of Chern ferromagnetism in MoTe$_2$ on the Landau-level mixing parameter.</p>

            <p>The physics of strongly correlated materials is deeply rooted in electron interactions and their coupling to low-energy excitations. Unraveling the competing and cooperative nature of these interactions is crucial for connecting microscopic mechanisms to the emergence of exotic macroscopic behavior, such as high-temperature superconductivity. Here we show that polarization-resolved multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) is able to selectively drive and measure coherent Raman excitations in different parts of the Fermi surface, where the superconducting gap vanishes or is the largest (respectively called Nodal and Antinodal region) in underdoped Bi-2212. Our evidence reveal that in the superconducting phase, the energy of Raman excitations in the nodal region is anti-correlated with the energy of electronic excitations at $\sim$1.6~eV, and both maintain coherence for over 44~fs. In contrast, excitations in the antinodal region show significantly faster decoherence ($<$18~fs) and no measurable correlations. Importantly, this long-lived coherence is specific to the superconducting phase and vanishes in the pseudogap and normal phases. This anti-correlation reveals a coherent link between the transition energy associated with the many body Cu-O bands and the energy of electronic Raman modes that map to the near-nodal superconducting gap. The different coherent dynamics of the nodal and antinodal excitations in the superconducting phase suggest that nodal fluctuations are protected from dissipation associated with scattering from antiferromagnetic fluctuations and may be relevant to sustaining the quantum coherent behaviour associated with high temperature superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Ordering in Moiré Graphene Multilayers from a Continuum Hartree+U Approach</h2>

            <p>Recently, symmetry-broken ground states, such as correlated insulating states, magnetic order and superconductivity, have been discovered in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) near the so-called magic-angle. Understanding the magnetic order in these systems is challenging, as atomistic methods become extremely expensive near the magic angle and continuum approaches fail to capture important atomistic details. In this work, we develop a self-consistent approach based on a continuum model that incorporates both short-ranged Hubbard interactions and long-ranged Coulomb interactions, therefore allowing efficient exploration of magnetic order in moiré graphene multilayers. With this approach, we perform a systematic analysis of the magnetic phase diagram of tBLG as a function of doping level and twist angle, near the magic angle. We find that the results are consistent with previous perturbative atomistic Hartree+U calculations. Furthermore, we predict stable magnetic orders for the tTLG. We found that the magnetic orders are similar to those in tBLG for small values of on-site repulsion. In the future, the developed method can be utilized to investigate magnetic ordering tendencies from short-range exchange interactions in other moiré graphene multilayers as a function of doping, twist angle, screening environment, among other variables.</p>

            <p>Disorder in frustrated quantum systems can critically influence their magnetic ground states and drive exotic correlated behavior. In the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ system ktenasite, Cu$_\text{2.7}$Zn$_\text{2.3}$(SO$_\text{4}$)$_\text{2}$(OH)$_\text{6}\cdot$6H$_\text{2}$O, we show that structural disorder drives an unexpected dimensional crossover and stabilizes a rare coexistence of distinct magnetic states. Neutron diffraction reveals significant Cu/Zn mixing at the Cu2 site, which tunes the Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice from a two-dimensional scalene-distorted triangular lattice into a one-dimensional spin-chain network. Magnetic susceptibility, neutron diffraction, ac susceptibility, and specific heat measurements collectively indicate magnetic duality: a coexistence of incommensurate long-range magnetic order below $T_\text{N} = 4\,$K and a cluster spin-glass state with $T_\text{f} = 3.28\,$K at $\nu = 10\,$Hz.

            <p>Quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) and excitonic insulators (EIs) are prototypical topological and correlated states of matter, respectively. The topological phase transition between the two has attracted much theoretical interest but experimental studies have been hindered by the availability of tunable materials that can access such a transition. Here, by utilizing the interaction-enhanced g-factor and the flat moiré bands in twisted bilayer WSe2 (tWSe2), we realize tunable electron-like and hole-like Landau levels (LLs) in the opposite valleys of tWSe2 under a perpendicular magnetic field. At half-band-filling, which corresponds to electron-hole charge neutrality, periodic oscillations between QSHIs (for fully filled LLs) and EIs (for half-filled LLs) are observed due to the interplay between the cyclotron energy and the intervalley correlation; QSHIs with up to four pairs of helical edge states can be resolved. We further analyze the effect of Fermi surface nesting on the stability of EIs via electric field-tuning of the moiré band structure. Our results demonstrate a novel QSHI-to-EI topological phase transition and provide a comprehensive understanding of the fermiology of tWSe2.</p>

            <p>Describing Li-ion battery positive electrodes in terms of distinct transition metal or oxygen redox regimes can lead to confusion in understanding metal-ligand hybridisation, oxygen dimerisation, and degradation. There is a pressing need to study the electronic structure of these materials and determine the role each cation and anion plays in charge compensation. Here, we employ transition metal L-edge X-ray Resonance Photoemission Spectroscopy in conjunction with Single Impurity Anderson models, Self-consistent Real Space Multiple Scattering spectral simulations, and Dynamical Mean-Field theory calculations to directly evaluate the redox mechanisms in (de-)lithiated battery electrodes. This approach reconciles the redox description of two canonical cathodes -- LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$ and LiNiO$_{2}$ -- in terms of varying degrees of charge transfer using the established Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen framework, common to condensed matter physics. In LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$, the absence of charge transfer means capacity arises due to the depopulation of metal $\textit{3d}$ states, i.e. conventional metal redox. Whereas, in LiNiO$_{2}$, charge transfer dominates and redox occurs through the formation and elimination of ligand hole states. This work clarifies the role of oxygen in Ni-rich system and provides a framework to explain how capacity can be extracted from oxygen-dominated states in highly covalent systems without needing to invoke dimerisation.</p>

            <p>We study the low-temperature phase diagram of quantum Kitaev-Heisenberg spin-orbital models with XXZ anisotropy on the honeycomb lattice. Within a parton mean-field theory, we identify three different quantum phases, distinguished by their symmetries. Besides a disordered spin-orbital liquid with unbroken U(1) x Z2 spin rotational symmetry, there are two orbital liquid phases characterized by spin long-range order. In these phases, the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken down to residual U(1) and Z2 symmetries, respectively. The symmetric spin-orbital liquid features three flavors of linearly dispersing gapless Majorana fermions. In the symmetry-broken phases, one of the three Majorana excitations remains gapless, while the other two acquire a band gap. The transitions from the symmetric to the symmetry-broken phases are continuous and fall into the fractionalized Gross-Neveu-Z2* and Gross-Neveu-SO(2)* universality classes, respectively. The transition between the ordered phases is discontinuous. Using a renormalization group analysis based on the epsilon expansion, we demonstrate that the triple point in the phase diagram features fractionalized fermionic multicriticality with emergent SO(3) symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen, Xin Luo, Duo Wang, Xu Cheng, Peng Cui</p>
            <p>In our recent experimental work (Appl. Phys. Lett. 125, 122109 (2024)), we observed that crystalline Si$_3$N$_4$ cap layers a few nanometers thick can form in situ on GaN surfaces. Compared with amorphous SiO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ caps, these crystalline caps yield cleaner GaN/Si$_3$N$_4$ interfaces with fewer defects and improved device performance. These observations raise two questions: why does Si$_3$N$_4$ away from the interface become amorphous as the cap thickens, and what is the actual crystal structure of the interfacial Si$_3$N$_4$? Previous work proposed a defect-wurtzite (DW) model constructed heuristically from $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ and the AlGaN lattice constants, but this model is significantly higher in energy than $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ and disagrees with experiment in both interlayer spacings and electronic gap. Using a systematic structure-search approach under in-plane lattice constraints commensurate with AlGaN, we identify a lower-energy configuration, denoted Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$, with quasi-two-dimensional (laminar) stacking normal to the interface. Under AlGaN-matched metrics, Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ is about 60 meV/atom more stable than DW-Si$_3$N$_4$ and reproduces the experimentally observed interlayer spacings more closely. The substantial lattice mismatch explains amorphization when the crystalline cap grows far from the interface. Upon full relaxation, both DW- and Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ exhibit wide $\sim$4 eV band gaps. Under AlGaN constraints, the DW gap collapses to $\sim$1.88 eV whereas Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ maintains a larger $\sim$2.70 eV gap (for reference, PBE gaps: GaN 1.73 eV, AlN 4.05 eV). The wider gap and improved structural match of Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ rationalize the superior capping performance and provide guidance for optimizing AlGaN/GaN device encapsulation.</p>

            <p>We consider a ladder system where one leg, referred to as the ``bath", is governed by an Aubry-André (AA) type Hamiltonian, while the other leg, termed the ``subsystem", follows a standard tight-binding Hamiltonian. We investigate the localization properties in the subsystem induced by its coupling to the bath. For the coupling strength larger than a critical value ($t'>t'_c$), the analysis of the static properties shows that there are three distinct phases as the AA potential strength $V$ is varied: a fully delocalized phase at low $V$, a localized phase at intermediate $V$, and a weakly delocalized (fractal) phase at large $V$. The fractal phase also appears in a narrow region along the boundary between the delocalized and localized phases. An analysis of the projected wavepacket dynamics in the subsystem shows that the delocalized phase exhibits a ballistic behavior, whereas the weakly delocalized phase is subdiffusive. Interestingly, the narrow fractal phase shows a super- to subdiffusive behavior as we go from the delocalized to localized phase. When $t'<t'_c$, the intermediate localized phase disappears, and we find a delocalized (ballistic) phase at low $V$ and a weakly delocalized (subdiffusive) phase at large $V$. Between those two phases, there is also an anomalous crossover regime where the system can be super- or subdiffusive. Beyond the ballistic phase observed at low $V$, we also identify a superdiffusive regime emerging in the limit $t'/V \ll 1$, which continuously approaches the ballistic behavior as $t' \to 0$. Finally, in some limiting scenario, we also establish a mapping between our ladder system and a well-studied one-dimensional generalized Aubry-André (GAA) model.</p>

            <p>Providing highly simplified models of strongly correlated electronic systems that challenge {\it ab initio} calculations can serve as a valuable testing ground to improve these methods. In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of one-dimensional transition metal mono-oxide chains (VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) using density functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$, and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations. The Hubbard $U$ parameter for DFT+$U$ is determined using the linear response theory. In all systems studied except MnO, the presence of multiple local minima -- primarily due to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the d-orbitals -- leads to significant challenges for DFT, DFT+U, and Hartree-Fock methods in finding the global minimum in ab initio calculations. Our results indicate that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is energetically favored for all chains, except CrO, when using DFT+$U$ and PBE. We analyze the electronic band structures and find that while the PBE approximation often predicts metallic or half-metallic ground states for the ferromagnetic (FM) state, DFT+$U$ approach successfully opens band gaps, correctly predicting insulating behavior in all cases. Furthermore, we compared the energy differences between the AFM and FM states using DFT+$U$ and CCSD for CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO and NiO. Our findings indicate that CCSD predicts larger energy differences in some cases compared to DFT+$U$, suggesting that the Hubbard $U$ parameter obtained through linear response theory may be overestimated when used to calculate energy differences between different magnetic states. For CrO, CCSD predicts an AFM ground state, in contrast to the predictions from DFT+$U$ and PBE methods.</p>

            <p>Understanding time-resolved quantum transport is crucial for developing next-generation quantum technologies, particularly in nano- and molecular junctions subjected to time-dependent perturbations. Traditional steady-state approaches to quantum transport are not designed to capture the transient dynamics necessary for controlling electronic behavior at ultrafast time scales. In this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, within the recently-developed iterated generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA), to study thermoelectric quantum transport beyond the wide-band limit approximation (WBLA). We employ the Meir-Wingreen formula for both charge and energy currents and analyze the transition from Lorentzian line-width functions to the WBLA, identifying unphysical divergences in the latter. Our results highlight the importance of finite-bandwidth effects and demonstrate the efficiency of the $i$GKBA approach in modeling time-resolved thermoelectric transport, also providing benchmark comparisons against the full Kadanoff-Baym theory. We exemplify the developed theory in the calculation of time-resolved thermopower and thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency in a cyclobutadiene molecular junction.</p>

In this work, we investigate this in two-component bosonic mixtures with finite-range interactions, probing 1D and 3D dynamics. Using path integral effective field theory within the one-loop approximation, we derive analytical expressions for zero-temperature ground-state energy and quantum depletion, seamlessly recovering contact interaction results in the contact limit. By crafting an effective action for decoupled density and spin modes, we compute dynamic structure factors (DSFs), revealing how finite-range interactions sculpt spin-density separation. A pivotal finding is the dimensionality-driven divergence in DSF peak dynamics: in 1D, peaks ascend to higher frequencies with increasing interaction strength, yielding sharp responses; in 3D, peaks descend to lower frequencies, with broader density wave profiles. These insights highlight dimensionality's critical role in collective excitations and provide a robust theoretical blueprint for probing interaction-driven quantum phenomena via Bragg spectroscopy, paving new pathways for exploring dimensionally tuned quantum correlations in ultracold quantum gases.</p>

            <h2>Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis and Social Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Klaus M. Frahm, Dima L. Shepelyansky</p>
            <p>In 1955 Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou performed first numerical studies with the aim to obtain the thermalization in a chain of nonlinear oscillators from dynamical equations of motion. This model happend to have several specific features and the dynamical thermalization was established only later in other studies. In this work we study more generic models based on Random Matrix Theory and social networks with a nonlinear perturbation leading to dynamical thermalization above a certain chaos border. These systems have two integrals of motion being total energy and norm so that the theoretical Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution depends on temperature and chemical potential. We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the society wealth is associated with energy in the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution. At relatively small values of total wealth or energy there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in physical systems such as multimode optical fibers. This condensation leads to a huge fraction of poor households at low wealth and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of companies at Stock Exchange of New York SE (NYSE), London and Hong Kong. It is also shown that above a chaos border the dynamical Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization takes place also in social networks with the Lorenz curves being similar to those of wealth distribution in world countries. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced thermoelectric effects in a driven one-dimensional system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. X. Zhang, Alessandro Braggio, Alessandro Romito, Fabio Taddei</p>
            <p>We investigate the thermoelectric properties of a one-dimensional quantum system in the presence of an external driving. We employ Floquet scattering theory to calculate linear-response stationary thermoelectric figures of merit in a single-channel conductor subjected to a periodically varying delta-like potential barrier. We also include a step barrier in one of the leads as a model of a nanoscale inhomogeneous semiconducting system. In the absence of a step barrier, we found that external driving can significantly enhance the Seebeck coefficient, particularly at low temperatures, with a relative increase of up to 200% at high frequencies compared to the static case. In the presence of a step barrier, we found that the thermoelectric Onsager coefficient for the driven case is also enhanced compared to the static case, with a significant photon-assisted effect at low temperatures when the chemical potential is within the semiconductor's gap. Our results demonstrate that external driving can be used to tune and enhance the thermoelectric capabilities of low-electron-density nanodevices.</p>

            <h2>Noninvertible symmetry and topological holography for modulated SPT in one dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jintae Kim, Yizhi You, Jung Hoon Han</p>
            <p>We examine noninvertible symmetry (NIS) in one-dimensional (1D) symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases protected by dipolar and exponential-charge symmetries, which are two key examples of modulated SPT (MSPT). To set the stage, we first study NIS in the $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ cluster model, extending previous work on the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ case. For each symmetry type (charge, dipole, exponential), we explicitly construct the noninvertible Kramers-Wannier (KW) and Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations, revealing dual models with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The resulting symmetry group structure of the SSB model is rich enough that it allows the identification of other SSB models with the same symmetry. Using these alternative SSB models and KT duality, we generate novel MSPT phases distinct from those associated with the standard decorated domain wall picture, and confirm their distinctiveness by projective symmetry analyses at their interfaces. Additionally, we establish a topological-holographic correspondence by identifying the 2D bulk theories-two coupled layers of toric codes (charge), anisotropic dipolar toric codes (dipole), and exponentially modulated toric codes (exponential)-whose boundaries host the respective 1D MSPT phases.</p>

            <h2>Thermal relaxation and the complete set of second order transport coefficients for the unitary Fermi gas from kinetic theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Hall, Thomas Schaefer</p>
            <p>We compute the complete set of second order transport coefficients of the unitary Fermi gas, a dilute gas of spin 1/2 particles interacting via an $s$-wave interaction tuned to infinite scattering length. The calculation is based on kinetic theory and the Chapman-Enskog method at second order in the Knudsen expansion. We take into account the exact two-body collision integral. We extend previous results on second order coefficients related to shear stress by including terms related to heat flow and gradients of the fugacity. We confirm that the thermal relaxation time is given by the simple estimate $\tau_\kappa = \kappa m/(c_PT)$ even if the full collision kernel is taken into account. Here, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $m$ is the mass of the particles, $c_P$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $T$ is the temperature.</p>

            <p>Nanofabrication of topological insulator (TI) devices is essential for accessing edge and interface states, but conventional lithography and etching compromise the atomically clean surfaces required for scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). We demonstrate a fabrication strategy that combines ex situ lithographic patterning with in situ ultrahigh-vacuum cleaving and flipping, yielding atomically clean, nanopatterned TI-superconductor heterostructures suitable for STM/STS. In Design I, nanoribbons were defined by etching trenches into a TI film and capping with Nb. This enabled spectroscopy on large areas, although edge quality was limited by etch debris. In Design II, local thinning defined buried nanoribbons within a continuous TI film, producing pristine planar surfaces. STM/STS revealed well-developed superconducting gaps in the surrounding film, with suppressed gaps on the nanoribbons, consistent with vertical proximity coupling. This approach establishes a reproducible pathway for high-resolution STM/STS studies of proximitized nanostructures, providing a scalable platform for exploring topological superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Thermal transport and the impact of hydrogen adsorption in Linde Type A zeolitic imidazolate frameworks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunseok Oh, Taeyong Kim</p>
            <p>Thermal transport in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is of practical interest in diverse applications such as gas storage and separations, since insufficient heat dissipation can lead to detrimental effects. Despite investigations, influence of molecular infiltration on the heat transport remains unclear in many of MOFs due to poor understanding of mechanisms governing heat conductions. Here, we report molecular dynamics investigations of thermal transport properties in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). We investigated Linde Type A topological ZIFs (ZIF-lta) exhibiting exceptionally low thermal conductivity with unusual trend of temperature dependence deviating from many crystalline materials, despite long-range crystalline order in them. We demonstrate that heat is predominantly carried by phonons with mean free paths comparable to their wavelengths, analogous to diffusons in amorphous solids owing to strong anharmonicity caused by complexity of unit cell consisting of a large number of metal centers. We further show that adsorbed hydrogen molecules increase thermal conductivity of ZIFs, mainly contributed by additional vibrational modes, as a result of gas-gas or gas-framework interactions. Our work advances fundamental understanding into the thermal transport in MOFs and suggests a means to engineer heat conduction via gas infiltrations.</p>

            <h2>A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Han, Axel van de Walle</p>
            <p>We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueshui Zhang, Ying-Hai Wu, Meng Cheng, Hong-Hao Tu</p>
            <p>We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christophe De Beule, Liangtao Peng, E. J. Mele, Shaffique Adam</p>
            <p>We investigate the role of long-range Coulomb interactions in $M$-valley moirés using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. This platform was recently proposed [Nature 643, 376 (2025) and arXiv:2411.18828 (2024)] as a new class of experimentally realizable moiré materials using twisted transition metal dichalcogenides homobilayers with the 1T structure. While these seminal studies considered the noninteracting theory without an electric displacement field, this work shows that both electron-electron interactions at finite doping and an interlayer bias strongly modify the moiré bands. For small twists ($\lesssim 5^\circ$) the density of states versus filling and interlayer bias displays qualitatively different behavior for twisting near aligned ($0^\circ$) and antialigned ($60^\circ$) stacking with tunable Van Hove singularities (VHSs). Moreover, interactions pin the VHS to the Fermi energy over a finite range of doping both at zero and finite bias depending on the stacking type, an effect known to enhance both superconductivity and strongly correlated states. At half filling, we obtain the phase diagram as a function of interaction strength, interlayer bias, and twist angle. We find a competition driven by band mixing between an isotropic ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet that are nearly degenerate over a wide range of experimentally accessible parameters. Our work demonstrates that correlated states in $M$-valley 1T tTMDs can be strongly tuned in situ both by applying an electric displacement field and by electron doping.</p>

            <p>We present a constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA method generally produces larger Hubbard U interaction values compared to conventional approaches. When applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$ , s-cRPA yields interaction parameters that align more closely with those required within DFT+U to reproduce the experimentally observed insulating state, addressing the metallic behaviour predicted by standard density functionals. We examine the issue of negative interaction values encountered in the projec- tor cRPA method for filled d-shells. We show that s-cRPA provides improved numerical stability by preserving electron number conservation, a constraint that is violated in the projector cRPA method. The s-cRPA approach addresses some limitations of standard cRPA methods, particularly the tendency to underestimate U values, suggesting its potential utility for the community. Addi- tionally, we have enhanced our implementation to include computation of multi-centre interactions for analysing spatial decay and developed an efficient low-scaling variant employing a compressed Matsubara grid to obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Yan Shao, Chen Lu, Zhiming Pan, Yu-Bo Liu, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism (AM), an unconventional magnetic phase characterized by zero net magnetism protected by symmetry(s) other than parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) and a resulting spin-split band, has been studied exclusively in crystalline materials. Here, we extend the framework of AM to quasicrystals (QCs). We start from a comparison between the Néel state on the square lattice and that on a $D_4$-symmetric Thue-Morse QC, with both belonging to the same $d$-wave irreducible representation (IRRP) of the $D_4$ point group. Consequently, while the former is antiferromagnetism (AFM) protected by the combined $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ and translational symmetry, the lack of translational symmetry in the latter breaks the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, and the additional mirror or rotation symmetry protects AM. This example suggests that AM is more common in QCs than in crystals and can be easily explored through a point-group symmetry-based classification. Therefore, we classify magnetic phases in 2D $D_n$-symmetric QCs without spin-orbit coupling, by using IRRPs of $D_n$. Consequently, the identity IRRP represents ferromagnetism, the inversion-odd 1D IRRPs for twice-of-odd $n$ represent AFM, and all the remaining 1D IRRPs represent AM, protected by either mirror or rotation symmetry. We further take the Hubbard model to verify this result in various QCs with different symmetries. Our work highlights the QC as a natural platform where AM is common among magnetic phases.</p>

            <p>Carbon Nanotubes have shown to be an attractive option in the race to find a replacement to silicon-based transistors, due to its high electrical conductivity, extraordinary mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. However, challenges with regards to controlling the purity and chirality of CNTs have raised doubts if the mass production of these transistors are even viable. This paper explores the challenges of scalability and proposes methods such as Liquid and Gas phase oxidative methods and microwave heating to tackle the problem of metal impurities found within CNTs and the methods of Catalyst Engineering and Chemical Vapor Deposition to control the chirality of CNTs. It also suggests techniques such as Lithography, Screen Printing and Stack Engineering to facilitate the large-scale production of CNT transistors. This paper also attempts to explore the methods of Laser Ablation and Arc Discharge that allows for the synthesis of CNTs of pure quality and high yield further facilitating the rise of mass production of CNT transistors. The feasibility and challenges relating to the integration of CNT transistors with already pre-existing circuitry was also investigated and the methods of annealing and potassium doping were studied and analyzed. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive guide to allow for the mass production and rapid integration of CNT transistors into the semi-conductor market.</p>

            <p>Kekulé-ordered graphene on SiC realized by intercalating two-dimensional metal layers offers a versatile platform for exploring intriguing quantum states and phenomena. Here, we achieve the intercalation of $(\mathrm{\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}})\mathit{R}30^\circ$-ordered Eu layer between epitaxial graphene and SiC substrate, realizing a Kekulé graphene with large local magnetic moments of intercalated Eu atoms. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we revealed that the Kekul{é} order folds the Dirac cones of graphene from the corners to the Brillouin zone center via intervalley scattering, forming the replica Dirac bands with gap opening. More intriguingly, the Dirac fermions in the replica Dirac bands show a strong exchange coupling with the localized magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ orbitals, resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. The observation of strong coupling between Dirac fermions and local magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ electrons via Kekulé order pave a new way for generating Dirac band splitting in graphene, advancing the potential applications of Kekulé-ordered graphene in spintronics, as well as exploring intriguing physical properties and correlation states for quantum technology.</p>

We derive the channel that optimally realizes the rare measurement trajectories, and establish a formal connection with the Petz recovery (time-reversal) map. We compute one- and two-point correlation functions in the conditioned state, revealing finite two-body correlations at arbitrarily large separations, and an underlying fractal structure, related to the Sierpiński triangle. These results demonstrate explicitly how boundary measurements can be used to control bulk properties of a quantum system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vipul Rai, Moupriya Das</p>
            <p>Erasure of the binary memory, 0 or 1, is an essential step for digital computation as it involves irreversible logic operations. In the classical case, the erasure of a bit of memory is accompanied by the evolution of a minimum amount of heat set by the Landauer bound kTln2, which can be achieved in the asymptotic limit. However, the erasure of memory needs to be completed within a finite time for practical and effective computational processes. It is observed that the higher the speed of erasure, the greater the amount of heat released, which leads to unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, this is a fundamental challenge to reduce the evolved heat related to finite-time memory erasure. In the present work, we address this crucial aspect in the field of information thermodynamics, where the two memory states correspond to the two wells of a bistable potential, as in the conventional cases. However, the potential is asymmetric in terms of the width of the two wells. Moreover, the two memory states are separated by a barrier that is asymmetric in structure. We examine in detail the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the success rate of the erasure process and the work done or heat released associated with it. We find that the asymmetry in the potential barrier partitioning the two memory states plays a very significant role in improving the efficiency of the erasure process, in view of the success rate and the thermodynamic costs. We retrieve the approach towards the Landauer limit in terms of the energetics involved with the erasure mechanism under the symmetric setup.</p>

            <p>We employ cell dynamics simulation based on the CH/BD model to investigate the self-assembly behavior of a mixed system consisting of diblock copolymers (AB), homopolymers (C), and Janus nanorods. The results indicate that, at different component ratios, the mixed system undergoes various phase transitions with an increasing number of nanorods. Specifically, when the homopolymer component is 0.40, the mixed system transitions from a disordered structure to a parallel lamellar structure, subsequently to a tilted layered structure, and ultimately to a perpendicular lamellar structure as the number of nanorods increases. To explore this phenomenon in greater depth, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of domain sizes and pattern evolution. Additionally, we investigate the effects of the repulsive interaction strength between polymers, wetting strength, length of nanorods, and degree of asymmetry on the self-assembly behavior of the mixed system. This research provides significant theoretical and experimental insights for the preparation of novel nanomaterials.</p>

In this work, we show that graphene under a magnetic field in the presence of a minimal length has a hidden $su(1,1)$ symmetry. This symmetry allows us to construct the spectrum algebraically. In fact, a generalized uncertainty relation, leading to a non-zero minimum uncertainty on the position, would be closer to physical reality and allow us to control or create bound states in graphene. Using the partition function based on the Epstein zeta function, the thermodynamic properties are well determined.

Possible behavior peculiarities of systems with different character of interaction in nonequilibrium case are predicted. By saddle-point method we find the dominant contributions to the partition function and obtain all thermodynamic parameters of the systems with different character of interaction. The formations of saddle state in all systems of interacting particles at different temperatures and particle distributions have the same physical nature and therefore they can be described in the same way.

            <p>The search for high-performance spintronic materials motivates the exploration of Heusler alloys with unconventional electronic properties. Using density functional theory with Hubbard correction (DFT+$U$, $U = 4$ eV), we investigate X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) alloys, which stabilize in the ferromagnetic L2$_1$-type structure with strong thermodynamic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveal contrasting behaviors: Ti$_2$MnGa transitions from a metallic L2$_1$-type phase to a spin gapless semiconductor (SGS) in the XA-type, while Ir$_2$MnGa exhibits gapless half-metallicity behavior in the L2$_1$-type but becomes half-metallic in the XA-type. The magnetic properties are governed by spd hybridization between Mn-3$d$ and X-$d$/Ga-$p$ states, which stabilizes ferromagnetism and tailors electronic states near the Fermi level. The Hubbard $U$ correction proves essential for accurately describing the correlated Mn-3$d$ electrons. These alloys combine structural stability with tunable electronic and magnetic properties, offering a promising platform for spin-polarized transport in next-generation spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyuan Zhu, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the out-of-plane lattice spacing increases with decreasing thickness. We resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. The principle also extends to perovskite ferroelectrics such as PbTiO$_3$, offering a strategy to eliminate critical thickness limits by selecting appropriate film orientations. As a practical pathway to device integration, we also identify the two-dimensional electride Ca$_2$N as a near-ideal electrode that fully restores the ferroelectric properties of HfO$_2$ in ultrathin capacitors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. V. Chalyi, E. V. Zaitseva</p>
            <p>This article is aimed at studying the effects of the dimensional crossover (DC) on physical properties of condensed systems near phase transition and critical points. Here we consider the following problems: (1) the theoretical provisions that allow to study the effect of spatial confinement on DC near phase transition and critical points; (2) the study of DC in condensed systems with the Ginzburg number $\mathrm{Gi} <1$, where fluctuation effects are described in different ways at the fluctuation, regular and intermediate (crossover) regions; (3) two types of DC were investigated: (a) a decrease in the linear dimensions $L$ to the values of the correlation length of the order parameter fluctuations leads to the conversion of the dependence on thermodynamic variable into a dependence on linear sizes of 3D systems, as well as (b) a further decrease in linear sizes $L$ the 3D-2D or 3D-1D DC happens depending on slitlike or cylindrical geometry, which is determined by the value of the lower crossover dimensionality $d_{\rm LCD}$; (4) it is proposed to extend the known equalities for critical exponents by using the Mandelbrot formula for fractal dimension $D_f$ as a critical exponent; (5) the influence of 3D-2D DC on the characteristics of the fine structure of the molecular light scattering (MLS) spectrum is studied.</p>

            <h2>Zero-energy resonances in ultracold hydrogen sticking to liquid helium films of finite thickness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Karakhanyan, A. Voronin, V. Nesvizhevsky, A. Semakin, S. Vasiliev</p>
            <p>We investigated quantum states of ultracold hydrogen atoms in a combined potential comprising the H-He film interaction in the presence of a substrate and the Earth gravitational field. We show that the shift and width of the gravitational quantum states are determined by the complex scattering length for the H-He film-substrate potential. We demonstrate that for specific helium film thicknesses above a substrate, zero-energy resonances occur if the combined potential supports a bound state exactly at the threshold. This effect leads to a complete restructuring of the bound states spectrum. The dynamics of gravitational levels as a function of the van der Waals interaction depth controlled by the helium film thickness is analyzed. It reveals the critical thicknesses at about 6.1 and 1.8 nm, at which resonances appear in the case of the conductive substrate. With imaginary integral operators, we incorporate non-perturbatively the inelastic effects originating from the ripplon coupling. The inelastic effects show dramatic changes in the sticking-coefficient behavior near the critical points. The enhanced sticking coefficients provide a probe for studying critical phenomena and measuring atom-surface interaction parameters with unprecedented sensitivity.</p>

            <h2>A causality-based divide-and-conquer algorithm for nonequilibrium Green's function calculations with quantics tensor trains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Inayoshi, Maksymilian Środa, Anna Kauch, Philipp Werner, Hiroshi Shinaoka</p>
            <p>We propose a causality-based divide-and-conquer algorithm for nonequilibrium Green's function calculations with quantics tensor trains. This algorithm enables stable and efficient extensions of the simulated time domain by exploiting the causality of Green's functions. We apply this approach within the framework of nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to the simulation of quench dynamics in symmetry-broken phases, where long-time simulations are often required to capture slow relaxation dynamics. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows to extend the simulated time domain without a significant increase in the cost of storing the Green's function.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate flux-flow instability (FFI) in a superconducting single-crystal titanium nitride (TiN) film with negligible volume pinning. By studying the critical current density in 12-nm thick TiN strips of varying widths, we accurately identify the experimental parameters at which the FFI regime occurs. A comprehensive analysis of critical velocity measurements allows us to determine the quasiparticle energy relaxation time, $\tau_E$. By comparing our results with the $\tau_E$ values obtained from other experimental methods, we gain insight into the dominant microscopic process that governs quasiparticle relaxation within the vortex core in TiN. This mechanism is driven by an increase in quasiparticle temperature relative to phonons, rather than by quasiparticles leaving the core. Our findings indicate that $\tau_E$ can be accurately determined through FFI measurements.</p>

            <p>Nanoporous materials hold promise for diverse sustainable applications, yet their vast chemical space poses challenges for efficient design. Machine learning offers a compelling pathway to accelerate the exploration, but existing models lack either interpretability or fidelity for elucidating the correlation between crystal geometry and property. Here, we report a three-dimensional periodic space sampling method that decomposes large nanoporous structures into local geometrical sites for combined property prediction and site-wise contribution quantification. Trained with a constructed database and retrieved datasets, our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency for property prediction on gas storage, separation, and electrical conduction. Meanwhile, this approach enables the interpretation of the prediction and allows for accurate identification of significant local sites for targeted properties. Through identifying transferable high-performance sites across diverse nanoporous frameworks, our model paves the way for interpretable, symmetry-aware nanoporous materials design, which is extensible to other materials, like molecular crystals and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Symplectic Quantization: numerical results for the Feynman propagator on a 1+1 lattice and the theoretical relation with Quantum Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Giachello, Francesco Scardino, Giacomo Gradenigo</p>
            <p>We present here the first lattice simulation of symplectic quantization, a new functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to define an algorithm to numerically sample the quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with all other present approaches. Symplectic quantization is characterized by a Hamiltonian deterministic dynamics evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$ analogous to the fictious time of stochastic quantization. The difference between stochastic quantization and the present approach is that the former is well defined only for Euclidean field theories, while the latter allows to sample the causal structure of space-time. In this work we present the numerical study of a real scalar field theory on a 1+1 space-time lattice with a $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction. We find that for $\lambda\ll1$ the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the free Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the dynamics in $\tau$, in force of a natural ergodic hypothesis connecting Hamiltonian dynamics with a generalized microcanonical ensemble. Analytically, we prove that this microcanonical ensemble, in the continuum limit, is equivalent to a canonical-like one where the probability density of field configurations is $P[\phi]\propto\exp(zS[\phi]/\hbar)$. The results from our simulations correspond to the value $z=1$ of the parameter in the canonical weight, which in this case is a well-defined probability density for field configurations in causal space-time, provided that a lower bounded interaction potential is considered. The form proposed for $P[\phi]$ suggests that our theory can be connected to ordinary quantum field theory by analytic continuation in the complex-$z$ plane.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Hoyos, Niko Jokela, José Manuel Penin</p>
            <p>We reinterpret the Nieh-Yan (NY) anomaly using holography, finding that the U(1) axial symmetry remains unbroken and the axial current coupling to an external gauge field is conserved. Instead, the anomaly arises from a breakdown of Hodge duality relations between fermion bilinears due to symmetry constraints on one-form currents. We show that the axial response associated with the NY term is distinct from the chiral vortical effect and exhibits a characteristic $T^2$ dependence. Torsion-induced axial transport decouples spin and axial charge dynamics, thereby clarifying the physical significance of the NY anomaly and motivating further field-theoretic and holographic studies.</p>

            <h2>Local fermion-to-qudit mappings: a practical recipe for four-level systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodolfo Carobene, Stefano Barison, Andrea Giachero, Jannes Nys</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guanyu Zhu</p>
            <p>We develop a topological theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial or CW complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation. One can further deformation retract the manifold back to a CW complex which supports a non-topological code with minimal overhead suitable for near-term implementation. Both types of codes admit cohomology operations including cup product which can induce non-Clifford gates. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to logical CCZ on 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-König bound for conventional topological codes with the aid of non-Euclidean geometries. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources ('magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</p>

            <h2>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</h2>

            <p>Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is fundamentally quantum or classical is essential for building accurate theoretical models and guiding experimental design. Here, we address this question in the context of polaritonic spectra, and report an intriguing new feature: the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the primary resonant polariton splitting, originating from vacuum field fluctuations. We show that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule limit under permutationally symmetrical initial-state constraint and that it follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary polariton splitting. This establishes a novel mechanism by which a quantum feature (the twin-polariton) can be tuned through a classical one (the primary polariton), offering new opportunities to probe and control the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</p>

            <p>Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Finite-Time Thermodynamics of Effective Two-Level Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Rolandi</p>
            <p>The optimization of the conversion of thermal energy into work and the minimization of dissipation for nano- and mesoscopic systems is a complex challenge because of the important role fluctuations play on the dynamics of small systems. We generalize the work of Esposito et al. EPL 89, 20003 (2010) to optimize at all driving speeds the control needed to extract the maximum amount of work from any effective two-level systems. These emerge when one coarse-grains degrees of freedom, which is often unavoidable to obtain "real-world" two-level systems. In particular, we allow even for the system to have underlying quantum dynamics, as long as these allow for a coarse-graining that leads to a Markovian master equation. We analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for any transformation performed on an effective two-level system.</p>

            <p>We present an all-mechanical protocol for coherent control and full quantum-state reconstruction of the fundamental flexural mode of a suspended carbon nanotube (CNT). Calibrated impulses from a nearby atomic force microscope (AFM) tip serve a dual role: they implement mechanical pi/2 rotations for Ramsey interferometry and realize phase-space displacements for Wigner function tomography via displaced-parity sampling. The same actuator thus unifies control and tomography while avoiding optical heating and eliminating on-chip microwave drive lines at the resonator. We derive explicit control pulse sequences and a master-equation description that map measured signals onto the energy-relaxation and phase-coherence times, as well as onto parity-based quantum signatures, including negative regions of the Wigner function. The approach is compatible with several readout modalities: direct AFM deflection, dispersive coupling to a Cooper-pair box, and dispersive microwave cavity probing. Together, these techniques provide complete access to populations, coherence, and parity within a single device architecture. This minimal scheme provides a practical route to all-mechanical quantum control and state-resolved characterization of decoherence in mesoscopic mechanical systems.</p>

            <p>Photoluminescent color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are powerful nanoscale solid-state quantum sensors that are explored in a plethora of quantum technologies. Methods for integrating them into macroscopic structures that improve their sensitivity and enable their large-scale deployment are highly sought after. Here, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced photoluminescence (PL) of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) and hBN nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in polymer-based thin-film optical cavities on the centimeter scale. The cavity resonances efficiently modulate the spectral PL peak position of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in FNDs across the NV PL spectrum and lead to an up to 2.9-fold Purcell-enhancement of the NV PL decay rate. The brightness of hBN NPs increases by up to a factor of three and the PL decay rate is enhanced by up to 13-fold inside the cavities. Finally, we find a 4.8 times improved magnetic field sensitivity of 20 nm FNDs in thin-film cavities due to cavity-enhanced optically detected magnetic resonance contrast and PL brightness. Our study demonstrates a low-cost and scalable method for the fabrication of quantum sensor-doped thin-film cavities, which is an important step toward the development of advanced quantum sensing technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Martínez-Puig, Gianluca D'Agostino, Ana Oña, Javier Rodríguez-Rodríguez</p>
            <p>The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengfei Zhang, Shuyan Zhou, Ning Sun</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valéria M. Mattiello, Victor L. Quito, Eduardo Miranda</p>
            <p>We present an asymptotically exact solution of a paradigmatic non-Hermitian model: the disordered interacting fermionic Hatano-Nelson model, or equivalently, the non-Hermitian spin-1/2 XXZ model. We use a renormalization group method suited for disordered systems and show that non-Hermitian couplings are relevant perturbations to the Hermitian model, which ultimately leads to a quantum-to-classical crossover. The ground state of the model consists of a collection of strongly coupled pairs of spins of arbitrary size at random positions which, unlike the Hermitian case, do not form singlets, but a mixture of the singlet and the $M=0$ triplet state. As a result, the magnetic susceptibility in the $x,y$-directions becomes negative and diverges at a finite small temperature. Additionally, in sharp contrast to the $\ln(L)$ increase observed in disordered Hermitian chains, the entanglement entropy of a partition of size $L$ saturates for large $L$, as the strongly coupled pairs become classical and stop contributing at large length scales.</p>

            <p>In very clean solid-state systems, where carrier-carrier interactions dominate over any other scattering mechanisms, the flow of electrons can be described within a hydrodynamic framework. In these cases, analogues of viscous fluid phenomena have been experimentally observed. However, experimental studies of electron hydrodynamics have so far been limited to the low velocity, linear response regime. At velocities approaching the speed of sound, the electronic fluid is expected to exhibit compressible behaviour where nonlinear effects and discontinuities such as shocks and choked flow have long been predicted. This compressible regime remains unexplored in electronic systems, despite its promise of strongly nonlinear flow phenomena. Here, we demonstrate compressible electron flow in bilayer graphene through an electronic de Laval nozzle, a structure that accelerates charge carriers past the electronic speed of sound, until they slow down suddenly in a shock. Discontinuities in transport measurements and local flattening of potential in Kelvin probe measurements are consistent with a viscous electron shock front and the presence of supersonic electron flow, and are not consistent with Ohmic or ballistic flow. Breaking the sound barrier in electron liquids opens the door for novel, intrinsically nonlinear electronic devices beyond the paradigm of incompressible flow.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahana Das, Glenn Wagner, Titus Neupert</p>
            <p>The fractional quantum Hall effect has recently been shown to exist in heterostructures of van der Waals materials without an externally applied magnetic field, e.g. in twisted bilayers of MoTe$_2$. These fractional Chern insulators break time-reversal symmetry spontaneously through polarization of the electron spins in a quantum spin Hall insulator band structure with flat bands. This prompts the question, which states could be realized if the spins remain unpolarized or polarize partially. Specifically, the possibility of time-reversal symmetric topological order arises. Here, we study this problem for odd integer filling of the bands, specifically focusing on vanishing and half valley polarization. Short of reliable microscopic models for small twist angles around $2.1^\circ$, we study the idealized situation of two Landau levels with opposite chirality, the two-valley quantum Hall model. Using exact diagonalization, we identify different phases arising in this model by tuning the interaction. In the physically relevant regime, the system initially exhibits phase-separated or valley-polarized states, which eventually transition into paired states by reducing onsite Coulomb repulsion.</p>

The observed phenomena are at the source of the generated THz far-field emission, typically through mechanisms such as spin-to-charge conversion triggered by the absorption of ultrafast optical pulses. In this work, we employ first-principles simulations to quantify the Rashba effect at PtSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$/LiNbO$_3$ interfaces, expanding the traditional understanding of spin transport by incorporating the orbital degree of freedom. Moreover, we quantify the degree of control on the THz emission depending on the polarization direction of LiNbO$_3$. In order to achieve this, we analyze the accumulation of both spin and orbital components using linear response theory, revealing distinct behaviors. These findings are crucial for a deeper understanding of the physical processes governing angular momentum-to-charge conversion and THz emission. Moreover, they may provide broader insights into various experimental outcomes, including those related to spin-orbit torque.</p>

            <h2>Fast momentum-selective transport of Bose-Einstein condensates via controlled non-adiabatic dynamics in optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raja Chamakhi, Dana Codruta Marinica, Naceur Gaaloul, Eric Charron, Mourad Telmini</p>
            <p>We present a detailed numerical study of a protocol for momentum-selective transport of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a one-dimensional optical lattice, achieving narrow momentum distributions through controlled non-adiabatic dynamics. The protocol consists of non-adiabatic loading into the lattice, coherent acceleration using a symmetric trapezoidal acceleration profile, and non-adiabatic release into free space. Using the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we simulate the full sequence and analyze the role of non-adiabatic excitations on the final momentum distribution. We identify the intra-site breathing dynamics as the dominant mechanism governing spectral purity under fast loading conditions. By tracking the condensate's spatial width during the evolution, we demonstrate a direct correlation with the final momentum spread. A variational model based on a Gaussian ansatz quantitatively reproduces the observed dynamics and provides physical insight into the breathing mechanism. Our results reveal the existence of magic times, i.e. specific loading or acceleration durations synchronized with the breathing oscillation period, where quasi-monochromatic momentum distributions can be achieved even with loading times as short as 100 $\mu$s, offering a route to coherent transport that is faster than adiabatic protocols. This approach is particularly relevant for quantum sensors operating under stringent timing constraints.</p>

            <p>In this work, we patterned a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) on the surface of a SrTiO$_3$ thin film grown homoepitaxially on SrTiO$_3$ by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (hMBE). We explored the superconducting dome in this material system by tuning electron density with ionic liquid gating. We found superconducting transitions up to 503 mK near an optimal electron density of approximately 3 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This is a meaningful increase from the typical optimal transition near 350 mK in similar 2DEGs on SrTiO$_3$ single crystal substrate surfaces. Systematic tuning of 2DEG electron density revealed a consistent BCS scaling between superconducting critical temperature, coherence length, and electron mean free path. Substantial variation of transition width across the dome was described by a paraconductivity model combining Aslamazov-Larkin and Maki-Thompson contributions.</p>

            <p>The advent of two-dimensional moiré systems has revolutionized the exploration of phenomena arising from strong correlations and nontrivial band topology. Recently, a moiré superstructure formed by two coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders with slightly mismatched wavevectors has been realized. These incommensurate CDWs can collectively exhibit commensurability, resulting in the jointly commensurate CDW (JC-CDW). This JC-CDW hosts phenomena including electronic anisotropy and phase-modulated hysteresis, and holds promise for non-volatile optoelectronic memory devices. Realizing such functionality requires understanding how the spatial periodicity, coherence, and amplitude of this order evolve under perturbations. Here, we address these questions using time- and momentum-resolved techniques to probe light-induced dynamics in EuTe$_4$. Our time-resolved diffraction results show that under intense photoexcitation, the JC-CDW wavevector and coherence length remain locked along the CDW direction, indicating preserved moiré periodicity while the moiré potential depth is suppressed. This robustness governs the configuration of the photoexcited JC-CDW and leads to the formation of previously underexplored shear-type topological defects. Furthermore, we developed an approach to simultaneously track the temporal evolution of the amplitude and phase of a CDW by following two diffraction peaks corresponding to one order, with findings verified by time-resolved photoemission and electron diffraction. This methodology enables reconstruction of the momentum- and time-resolved evolution of the JC-CDW and direct visualization of shear-type topological defect formation. These findings not only highlight the unique robustness of JC-CDWs out of equilibrium, but also establish a platform for optical moiré engineering and manipulation of quantum materials through topological defect control.</p>

            <p>The interplay between many-body and spin-orbit effects (SOC) can lead to novel phenomena in solids. Chiral spin modes (CSM) are collective spin excitations that arise from such interplay and connect states with opposite chirality, which, however, have been rarely observed. Here, we report a gate-tunable CSM that occurs between conduction SOC-split minibands in near-0°-twisted WSe2/WS2 bilayers. This mode manifests as a sharp resonance with giant Raman efficiency in the pseudovector-symmetry channel of the Raman spectra. By varying fillings, the CSM transitions from chiral spin exciton to excitonic polaron. The spin-flip nature is directly confirmed by the Zeeman effect. Moreover, the filling dependence compellingly evidences a charge-transfer insulator at filling of one. Our results demonstrate transition-metal-dichalcogenides moiré superlattices as a fertile platform for exploring exotic low-lying collective excitations.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a highly tunable class of crystalline materials where metal atoms or clusters are connected by organic linkers. They offer a versatile platform for exploring quantum phenomena such as entangled magnetism, superconductivity, and topology. Particularly for magnetism, their modular chemistry enables extensive control over magnetic interactions, spin magnitudes, lattice geometries, and even light-responsiveness, making them a uniquely adaptable platform. However, despite their promise, their low-temperature behavior and magnetic properties remain largely unexplored and represent an underappreciated opportunity in quantum materials research. With potential applications ranging from quantum computation to energy transfer, we believe that MOFs and particularly {\it magnetic} MOFs offer a vast and largely untapped frontier for transformative discoveries and high-impact quantum materials research.</p>

            <h2>The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model on a one-dimensional lattice: Analytical wave functions of topological edge states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weibo Xu</p>
            <p>The one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is a prototype model in the field of topological condensed matter physics, and the existence and characteristics of its topological edge states are crucial for revealing the topological essence of low-dimensional systems. This paper focuses on the analytical wave functions of topological edge states in the SSH model, systematically sorting out the fundamentals of model construction. Based on the tight-binding approximation, it derives the matrix form of the SSH model Hamiltonian and the band structureand clarifies the role of chiral symmetry in the classification of topological phases. By solving the Schrodinger equation of the finite-length lattice, the mathematical expression of the analytical wave function of topological edge states is fully derived, verifying its localized feature of exponential decay. Moreover, it quantitatively analyzes the influence laws of lattice parameters (hopping integrals, lattice constants), electron-electron interactions, and external field perturbations on the wave function amplitude, decay coefficient, and energy. Furthermore, it establishes the quantitative correlation between the analytical wave function and electronic transport (conductivity) as well as optical properties (light absorption coefficient), and discusses its application prospects in the design of topological qubits and the development of new topological materials. The research results provide theoretical support for an in-depth understanding of the physical essence of low-dimensional topological states and lay a foundation for the performance optimization of topology-related devices.</p>

            <p>Classical nucleation theory predicts size-dependent nucleation and melting due to surface and confinement effects at the nanoscale. In correlated electronic states, observation of size-dependent nucleation and melting is rarely reported, likely due to the extremely small length scales necessary to observe such effects for electronic states. Here, using 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes as a prototypical two-dimensional (2D) charge density wave (CDW) system, we perform in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy with temperature down to 20 K and observe size-dependent nucleation and melting of CDWs. Specifically, we observe a melting point depression of CDW for 1T-TiSe$_2$ flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. By fitting experimental data to a Ginzburg-Landau model, we estimate a zero-temperature correlation length of 10--50 nm, which matches the reported CDW domain size for 1T-TiSe$_2$. As the flake size approaches the correlation length, the divergence of the CDW correlation length near the transition is cut off by the finite flake size, limiting long-range order and thereby lowering the transition temperature. For very small flakes whose size is close to the correlation length, we also observe absence of CDWs, as predicted by the model. We thus show that an electronic phase transition follows classical nucleation theory.</p>

            <h2>$Δ_T$ Noise as a Robust Diagnostic for Chiral, Helical and Trivial Edge Modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sachiraj Mishra, Colin Benjamin</p>
            <p>In this article we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise provides a sensitive, practical probe for distinguishing chiral edge modes from topological helical and trivial (non-topological) helical edge transport. Measured under zero-current conditions, $\Delta_T$ noise reveals contrasts that conventional conductance measurements typically miss. Crucially, $\Delta_T$ requires no external energy input in the form of an applied voltage bias, yet encodes the same intrinsic information that shot noise yields in the zero-temperature, finite-bias limit, without the distorting effects of Joule heating. This absence of bias-induced heating makes $\Delta_T$ noise both more precise and more reliable than conventional shot-noise approaches. Moreover, the diagnostic power of $\Delta_T$ noise persists at finite frequencies $\omega$ too. The frequency-dependent signal $\Delta_{T}(\omega)$ exhibits distinctive spectral signatures (including sign changes) that further enhance its utility as an experimentally accessible fingerprint of edge-mode topology.</p>

            <p>This study investigates a vortex sensor based on a nanoscale (sub-100 nm) magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) with a strong shape anisotropy, designed for sensitivity to the out-of-plane magnetic field component ($H_z$). The sensor comprises a free layer with a vortex configuration and a perpendicularly magnetized reference layer, which provides a reproducible and linear response when excited by a perpendicular magnetic field. Experimental measurements and micromagnetic simulations were combined to systematically assess the influence of structural parameters, specifically aspect ratio and defect landscape, on key sensor performance metrics, including dynamic range, sensitivity, and detectivity. The out-of-plane vortex sensor demonstrates a significantly improved dynamic range exceeding 200 mT, compared to the 40-80 mT typical of conventional in-plane vortex sensors. Frequency-dependent noise measurements reveal that the sensor exhibits low intrinsic noise, along with improved detectivity and resolution. This performance is ascribed to the field-dependent expansion and contraction of the vortex core, which reduces Barkhausen-type noise caused by defect-induced pinning potentials. Moreover, the sub-100\,nm lateral dimensions of the sensor enable scalable array integration, providing further enhancements in noise and detectivity through collective averaging. These results underscore the potential of this sensor architecture for advanced magnetic field sensing applications requiring a wide dynamic range and high measurement accuracy at the same time.</p>

            <p>Computational materials science has evolved toward materials informatics, where large datasets of complex, multispecies compounds are generated and evaluated using density functional theory (DFT). Materials genome projects mine these datasets for candidates with breakthrough properties, but existing databases remain limited to compounds with relatively small unit cells due to computational cost. Exascale computers now provide the power to simulate larger and more chemically realistic systems, but fully realizing this potential requires DFT codes that can efficiently scale to thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) DFT code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which form large, anisotropic supercells. Our results link strain and twist angle to material informatics properties, including stability and band gap, and show that pyRMG can initialize and converge challenging RMG-based workflows with limited user intervention.</p>

Similarly to Boltzmann inversion method in spatial coarse graining, which begins with a free energy called potential of mean force, we test the effect of a generalized potential of mean force that uses the distinct part of the Van Hove correlation function with a characteristic time different from zero. We show that the method is approximately equivalent to replace the hard core of the original potential by a smooth harmonic function. We then compare the results of simulations using the modified potential and the original one. Results show that this simple modification of the potential, namely replacing the short range wall with a smooth quadratic law, leads to a shift in the time step resulting in the same dynamics than the original potential function but with a much larger time step.</p>

Prompted by this finding we investigate the presence of a similar transition in supercooled water. We find the presence of the phase transition in water despite the numerous anomalies of water, suggesting universality of the transition. The transition appears at constant temperature, being only induced by the motion of a small percentage of active molecules and the system cooperativity. We observe that cooperative motions strongly increase at the transition and do not disappear when the medium viscosity drops. An increase of temperature is needed to make the cooperative motions disappear, suggesting a connection to the kinetic energy to potential energy ratio instead of the medium viscosity.</p>

It is contrasted with the TMR ratio made of ferromagnets, where it is proportional to $J^{2}/\Gamma ^{2}$ for small $\Gamma $. Therefore, the TMR ratio is larger in ferromagnets for $\left\vert J\right\vert >\Gamma $. However, the $X$-wave magnets are expected to achieve high-speed and ultra-dense memory owing to the zero net magnetization.</p>

By integrating this mechanism into the Shockley model, we predict a near 100 enhancement in magnetoresistance sensitivity under small forward bias, where exponen tial modulation of recombination lifetimes by magnetic fields amplifies resistance changes. Angular momentum conservation enables magnetically tunable circularly polarized luminescence: exclusive conduction-band or valence-band splitting in both neutral regions achieves near-half po larization, while global splitting degrades emission coherence. Furthermore, we propose a "spin Zener filter" exploiting 1eV valence band splitting in (Ga, Mn)As, where spin-dependent barrier heights generate near 100% spin-polarized tunneling currents within a voltage-selective win dow.

            <p>Atomic and molecular scattering at semiconductor interfaces plays a central role in surface chemistry and catalysis, yet predictive simulations remain challenging due to strong nonadiabatic effects causing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we present fully quantum simulations of H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling, incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering, capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and perturbative approaches.</p>

By integrating Cd3As2 nanowires with on-chip superconducting LC resonators, we achieve sensitive detection of both resistance and quantum capacitance variations. In a long-channel device (L ~ 1.8 {\mu}m), clear Fabry-Pérot (FP) interference patterns are observed in both DC and RF measurements, provide strong evidence for ballistic electron transport. RF reflectometry reveals gate-dependent modulations of the resonance frequency, arising from quantum capacitance oscillations induced by changes in the density of states and FP interference. These oscillations exhibit a quasi-periodic structure that closely correlates with the FP patterns in DC transport measurements. In another device of a Cd3As2 nanowire Josephson junction (L ~ 730 nm, superconducting Al contacts), FP interference patterns are too weak to be resolved in DC conductance but are detectable using RF reflectometry. These results demonstrate the high quality of our Cd3As2 nanowires and the versatility of RF reflectometry, establishing their potential for applications in topological quantum devices, such as Andreev qubits or gatemon architectures.</p>

Estimated through three-phonon interactions, the lattice thermal conductivity is intrinsically low, primarily due to acoustic phonon contributions and suppressed optical phonon transport. The thermoelectric coefficients are enhanced with carrier doping, resulting in figures of merit as high as 8.94 at room temperature and upto 36.31 at elevated temperatures. These findings establish two-dimensional lead halide Janus layers as exceptional candidates for thermoelectric conversion, and the insights into their elemental and electronic characteristics offer a valuable basis for the future design of high-performance lead-based thermoelectric materials.</p>

            <h2>Antiferromagnetic nonreciprocity of light emission in CuB$_2$O$_4$</h2>

            <p>Nonreciprocity of light emission, when the radiation intensity differs for two opposite propagation directions, is a rare phenomenon in solids because it requires a violation of the crystal symmetry with respect to time-reversal. Such violation via time-reversal symmetry breaking can occur either due to an applied magnetic field or due to a magnetic ordering. We perform a detailed theoretical and experimental study of the photoluminescence (PL) nonreciprocity in the noncentrosymmetric tetragonal antiferromagnet CuB$_2$O$_4$, where this effect reaches 80\% below the Néel phase transition temperature of $T_N = 20$~K. The effect is observed for three sets of extremely narrow exciton and exciton-magnon PL lines, associated with Frenkel excitons on the Cu$^{2+}$ ions in the magnetic $4b$ subsystem. A strong manifestation of the nonreciprocity of emission is found in certain geometries for the commensurate antiferromagnetic phase, as well as in other phases with incommensurate spin ordering. In accordance with the magnetic symmetry of CuB$_2$O$_4$, the nonreciprocity of emission is observed for light propagation along certain directions within the easy (001) plane. A rigorous quantum-mechanical analysis of the wave functions of the initial and final states of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions responsible for the PL is performed for various experimental geometries of the crystallographic axes and the applied magnetic field. The analysis confirms that the nonreciprocity of emission from Frenkel excitons in CuB$_2$O$_4$ is due to the interference of magnetic-dipole and electric-dipole transitions of antiferromagnetically ordered $4b$ spins of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions, in good agreement with the experimental data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barkha Khattar, Anzar Ali, Masahiko Isobe, Yogesh Singh</p>
            <p>The Yb based triangular lattice delafossites $A$Yb$X_2$ ($A$ = alkali metal, $X$ = O, S, Se) have recently been studied as quantum spin liquid candidates. We report the synthesis of powders and single crystals of CuYbSe$_2$ with a perfect triangular lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ moments. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic ordering down to $1.8$~K in spite of a significant antiferromagnetic exchange between Yb$^{3+}$ moments, suggesting a frustrated magnetic system. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate insulating behavior, consistent with the localized nature of magnetic moments. Heat capacity reveals that CuYbSe$_2$ can be treated as an effective spin $S = 1/2$ triangular lattice antiferromagnet below $\sim 50$~K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystals reveals weak magnetic anisotropy. These properties position CuYbSe$_2$ as a promising candidate for a quantum spin liquid state and as a new platform for exploring exotic magnetic ground states in triangular lattice systems.</p>

            <p>We report the growth of high quality rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) crystals by the iron flux method at atmospheric pressure. In contrast to the lamellar structure of standard hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) covering the metal ingot, the current synthetized BN shell is composed of many triangular bulk crystallites, of submillimeter size, predominantly in the rhombohedral phase, with only weak traces of hBN detected by high resolution X-ray diffraction. The low-temperature photoluminescence emission confirms the excellent quality of the rhombohedral stacking with unprecedented width for all phonon replicas at the band edge. The Raman spectra are characterized by the absence of any low-energy modes at $\sim50$ cm$^{-1}$, the presence of an extended band around $800$ cm$^{-1}$ and an asymmetric high energy mode at $1366$ cm$^{-1}$. These observations are in very good agreement with the phonon dispersion calculated for the rhombohedral primitive cell with $C_{3v}$ symmetry.</p>

            <p>Terbium and thulium thin films were produced by Molecular Plating under controlled conditions to elucidate a possible influence of water and carbon dioxide present in the plating solution. Platings were made in a glovebox with variable concentration of residual water and \ce{CO2} in a controlled inert atmosphere to study the impact on the quality of the produced thin films and on deposition yields. The morphology of the thin films was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The deposition yield was determined by neutron activation analysis at the research reactor TRIGA Mainz. Chemical analysis of the deposited layers was conducted using a combination of infrared, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Raman and IR spectra reveal the formation of hydroxides, oxides and carbonates. Water in the plating solution affects the quality of the thin films when its concentration exceeds 1 vol.-\%. The presence of \ce{CO2} leads to an increased carbonate content, which negatively influences the film quality</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Ming Cui, Zhong-Ying Fan</p>
            <p>The symmetry of Ising model questions any single crossover scenario for supercritical fluids. In this work, we firstly study a pair of thermodynamic crossovers $L^\pm$ analytically for the Van der Waals class fluids. We uncover an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry in addition to the universal scalings in the scaling regime for this class fluids. By using the self-reciprocal property between coexistenct phases, we further establish that under suitable conditions, the Ising symmetry generally emerges in the scaling regime for a general universality class. As a consequence, the thermodynamic crossovers $L^\pm$ generally exhibit an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry in the scaling regime. This partly resolves the symmetry puzzle raised by the Ising model. The results also imply that the physical importance of the Ising model in critical phenomenon is far beyond the scope of magentic transitions.</p>

            <p>The synthesis of crystalline materials, such as zeolites, remains a significant challenge due to a high-dimensional synthesis space, intricate structure-synthesis relationships and time-consuming experiments. Considering the one-to-many relationship between structure and synthesis, we propose $\texttt{DiffSyn}$, a generative diffusion model trained on over 23,000 synthesis recipes spanning 50 years of literature. $\texttt{DiffSyn}$ generates probable synthesis routes conditioned on a desired zeolite structure and an organic template. $\texttt{DiffSyn}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance by capturing the multi-modal nature of structure-synthesis relationships. We apply $\texttt{DiffSyn}$ to differentiate among competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. As a proof of concept, we synthesize a UFI material using $\texttt{DiffSyn}$-generated synthesis routes. These routes, rationalized by density functional theory binding energies, resulted in the successful synthesis of a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ of 19.0, which is expected to improve thermal stability and is higher than that of any previously recorded.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco G. Capone, Giulio De Filippis, Vittorio Cataudella, Antonio de Candia</p>
            <p>We investigate the efficiency of different quantum Monte Carlo simulations of a pair of antiferromagnetically coupled qubits in an Ohmic dissipative environment. Using a Trotter-Suzuky decomposition and integrating out the degrees of freedom of the thermal bath, the model maps onto a frustrated long-range double-chain Ising lattice. We prove that: i) due to frustration, the conventional Swendsen-Wang approach to cluster dynamics turns out to suffer from a severe inefficiency, stemming from the mismatch between spin correlations and cluster connectivity; ii) the Kandel-Domany approach is extremely effective in the study of dissipative quantum qubits. We partition the double-chain into different types of plaquettes and minimize the weight of graphs containing antiferromagnetic bonds by using both analytic and numerical approaches. Monte Carlo simulation results show that ``long range'' plaquette decompositions are more efficient than the ``local'' ones, especially for high levels of dissipation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-Wen Huang, Xiang-Jian Hou, Ying-Hai Wu</p>
            <p>We study phase transitions in bilayer and trilayer bosonic quantum Hall systems. In the absence of interlayer tunneling and interaction, each layer is chosen to have filling factor $\nu=1/2$ or $1$ to realize the Laughlin state or the Moore-Read state. By tuning interlayer tunneling and/or interaction, multiple phases can be generated. In the absence of interlayer interaction, three phase transitions appear when interlayer tunneling becomes sufficiently strong: (1) from two decoupled $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin states to the Moore-Read state in bilayer systems; (2) from one $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin state plus one $\nu=1$ Moore-Read state to the Read-Rezayi $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ state in bilayer systems; (3) from three decoupled $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin states to the Read-Rezayi $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ state in trilayer systems. Numerical calculations suggest that these transitions are third-order ones. We propose non-Abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory to describe them. If both interlayer tunneling and interaction are present, one-component or multi-component composite fermion liquids and Jain states can be realized. This leads to intricate phase diagrams that host multiple phase transitions and possibly exotic critical points.</p>

            <p>The surface states of 3D topological insulators possess geometric structures that imprint distinctive signatures on electronic transport. A prime example is the Berry curvature, which controls electric frequency doubling via a higher order moment, called Berry curvature triple. In addition to the Berry curvature, topological surface states are expected to exhibit a nontrivial quantum metric, which plays a key role in governing nonlinear magnetotransport. However, its manifestation has yet to be experimentally observed in 3D topological insulators. Here, we provide evidence for a nonlinear response activated by the quantum metric of the topological surface states of Sb$_2$Te$_3$. We measure a time-reversal odd, nonlinear magnetoresistance that is independent of temperature and disorder below 30 K and is thus of intrinsic geometrical origin. Our measurements demonstrate the existence of quantum geometry-induced transport in topological phases of matter and provide strategies for designing novel functionalities in topological devices.</p>

            <p>Molecular spins offer a promising platform for quantum sensing, particularly in organic, supramolecular or biological environments. Detection of periodic magnetic fields has been demonstrated with molecular spins ($S$ = 1/2) using manipulation protocols synchronized with the probed field. In this work, we develop two quantum sensing protocols that enable discrimination between different time-dependent magnetic field signals, without synchronization. These are based on the Hahn echo sequence and have been tested on VO(TPP) and $\text{VOPt(SCOPh)}_4$ molecular spins embedded in a superconducting YBCO microwave resonator. We report a magnetic field sensitivity up to a few $10^{-7} T \text{Hz}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ (with lower bounds approaching $10^{-8} T \text{Hz}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$) for signals with duration of a few microseconds. Under the given conditions, the minimum signal area that can be measured is in the $10^{-10}$ T s range, suggesting a potential trade-off between minimum measurable field and the required signal duration and memory time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucio Mauro Carenza, Giuseppe Negro, Pasquale Digregorio, Antonio Suma, Giuseppe Gonnella</p>
            <p>Through molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the phase separation and aggregation dynamics of active dumbbell particles in two-dimensions subjected to shear. We find that the growth of the phase-separated region is arrested when shear is applied, with the average clusters size plateauing towards a value $R_s$ that remains constant over time. While activity enhances the resilience of clusters against shear-induced breakup, $R_s$ decreases with growing shear rate $\dot\gamma$, with an intermediate regime where $R_s\propto \dot\gamma^{-1}$. We find that clusters in the stationary state are progressively less polarized and increasingly elongated with increasing shear. At the same time, we find a breaking in chiral symmetry of both rotation direction and internal organization of clusters: typically, dumbbells point towards the cluster center with a small non-zero angle, such that the active torque opposes the shear torque, with cluster's angular velocity well captured by a simplified analytical model. We argue this conformation makes clusters more stable against shear.</p>

            <p>The terahertz (THz) properties of ZrN thin films grown with CMOS-techniques on industry-standard 300 mm silicon wafers are investigated in order to explore their superconducting behavior. The films have thicknesses ranging from 18 to 48 nm, and their critical temperatures Tc are between 5 and 7.3 K. We probe the real and imaginary parts of the complex dynamical conductivity sigma in the frequency range from 100 - 540 GHz (0.4 - 2.2 meV) and as a function of temperature. The experiments provide direct access to the low-energy electrodynamics and key materials parameters such as superconducting energy gap and superfluid density. Our findings indicate that ZrN is a weakly coupled BCS-type superconductor with a gap-to-Tc ratio of approximately 3.4 in the thick film limit. For thinner films, this coupling ratio increases up to 4.0, departing from the BCS prediction. The results establish large-scale ZrN thin films as promising material for high-frequency superconducting applications.</p>

            <p>Electric and magnetic multipole densities in crystalline solids, including the familiar electric dipole density in ferroelectrics and the magnetic dipole density in ferromagnets, are of central importance for our understanding of ordered phases in matter. However, determining the magnitude of these quantities has proven to be conceptually and technically difficult. Here we present a universally applicable approach, based on projection operators, that yields gauge-invariant absolute measures for all types of electric and magnetic order in crystals. We demonstrate the utility of the general theory using concrete examples of electric and magnetic multipole order in variants of lonsdaleite and diamond structures. Besides the magnetic dipole density in ferromagnets, we also consider, e.g., the magnetic octupole density in altermagnets. The robust method developed in this work lends itself to be incorporated into the suite of computational materials-science tools. The multipole densities can be used as thermodynamic state variables including Landau order parameters.</p>

            <p>Clinically, palpation is one of the important diagnostic methods to assess tumor malignancy. In laboratory research, it is well accepted that the bulk stiffness of the tumor and the surrounding tissue is closely correlated with the malignant state of the tumor. Here, we postulate that, in addition to tumor stiffness, tumor viscoelasticity - the fact that tumor tissue takes time to bounce back after compression, can also be used to evaluate the tumor malignancy state. In this work, we characterized the viscoelastic properties of breast tumor spheroids using a recently developed microfluidic compression device and a theoretical power law model. Breast tumor cells at varying malignant levels; a non-tumorigenic epithelial (MCF10A), moderately malignant tumor (MCF7) and triple negative metastatic tumor (MDA-MB-231) cells were used. Spheroids embedded within a 3D extracellular matrix were periodically compressed, and their strain responses were recorded using microscopic imaging. Our results revealed that the measured strain relaxation curves can be successfully described by a modified power law model, demonstrated that non-tumorigenic tumor spheroids were more elastic, exhibited shorter relaxation time and less plasticity than those of tumorigenic spheroids. Together, these results highlight that viscoelastic properties in addition to bulk stiffness of the tumor spheroids can serve as a complementary mechanical biomarker of tumor malignancy and demonstrate the validity of a modified power law model for the mechanical characterization of a living tissue.</p>

            <p>The Grüneisen ratio, defined as $\Gamma_g \equiv (1/T) (\partial T/\partial g)_S$, serves as a highly sensitive probe for detecting quantum critical points (QCPs) driven by an external feild $g$ and for characterizing the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). Near a QCP, the Grüneisen ratio displays a universal divergence which is governed by a universality-class-dependent scaling function stemming from the scale invariance. In this work, we systematically investigate the universal scaling functions of Grüneisen ratio in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin systems, including the transverse-field Ising model, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, the quantum $q$-state Potts model ($q=3,4$) and the $J_1$-$J_2$ columnar dimer model. Our approach employs the thermal tensor-network method for infinite-size 1D systems and the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE QMC) simulations for 2D systems, enabling precise calculations of the Grüneisen ratio near QCPs. Through data collapse analysis, we extract the corresponding scaling functions, which establish quantitative frameworks to interpret magnetocaloric experiments and guide the development of ultralow-temperature refrigeration.</p>

            <p>Enabling a hydrogen economy requires the development of materials resistant to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). More than 100 years of research have led to several mechanisms and models describing how hydrogen interacts with lattice defects and leads to mechanical property degradation. However, solutions to protect materials from hydrogen are still scarce. Here, we investigate the role of interstitial solutes in protecting critical crystalline defects sensitive to hydrogen. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon in solid solutions at grain boundaries can efficiently prevent hydrogen segregation. We then realized this interface protection concept on martensitic steel, a material strongly prone to HE, by doping the most sensitive interfaces with different concentrations of boron and carbon. This segregation, in addition to stress relaxations, critically reduced the hydrogen ingress by half, leading to an unprecedented resistance against HE. This tailored interstitial segregation strategy can be extended to other metallic materials susceptible to hydrogen-induced interfacial failure</p>

            <p>We investigated the magnetic and thermoelectric properties of the full Heusler alloy Co$_2$NbSn, which exhibits a martensitic transformation at 240 K. Magnetization measurements reveal weak itinerant ferromagnetism in the martensitic phase, which is well described by Takahashi's spin fluctuation theory. The characteristic spin fluctuation parameters were estimated to be T_0 = 1.0$\times$10^3 K and T_A = 7.2$\times$10^3 K. Seebeck coefficient measurements under magnetic fields up to 9 T show complex temperature and field dependence, which we decomposed into electron diffusion, spin fluctuation drag, and magnon drag components. A significant magnon-drag contribution was identified in both austenite and martensitic phases. Remarkably, this contribution is strongly enhanced in the martensitic phase compared to the austenite phase, despite a smaller magnetic moment. These findings provide evidence for robust low-energy spin excitations and highlight the potential of martensitic transformation in enhancing the thermoelectric performance of itinerant ferromagnetic alloys.</p>

            <p>We derive several exact results for the dynamics of CP$^{N-1}$ skyrmions with arbitrary $N$. Fractonic continuity equation is shown to hold for arbitrary CP$^{N-1}$ fluid implying the conservation of the topological charge and the dipole moment. Inclusion of the Gilbert damping modifies the continuity equation, resulting in the violation of the dipole moment conservation but not of the topological charge. Thiele's equation for the CP$^{N-1}$ skyrmion follows from the modified continuity equation. The Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) algebra in the long-wavelength limit is derived for arbitrary CP$^{N-1}$ fluid. In the case of CP$^2$ skyrmions, we identify two kinds of energetically stable skyrmions in which the quadrupolar moments or the ferromagnetic moments are dominant. In the latter case, one can associate a nonzero CP$^1$ charge equal to half the CP$^2$ skyrmion charge and argue that the topological Hall effect of electrons should exist due to their coupling to the ferromagnetic part of the CP$^2$ texture.</p>

            <h2>Coarsening dynamics for spiral and nonspiral waves in active Potts models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Noguchi</p>
            <p>This study examines the domain-growth dynamics of $q$-state active Potts models ($q = 3$--$8$) under the cyclically symmetric conditions using Monte Carlo simulations on square and hexagonal lattices. By imposing active cyclic flipping of states, finite-length waves emerge in the long-term limit. This study focuses on coarsening dynamics from an initially random mixture of states to these moving-domain states. When spiral waves appear in the final state, the correlation length follows the Lifshitz--Allen--Cahn (LAC) law ($\propto t^{1/2}$) until saturation is observed at the characteristic wavelength. By contrast, in the case of nonspiral waves, the growth rate is raised prior to the saturation, leading to a transient increase in the coarsening exponent. Moreover, the mean cluster size exhibits a similar form of transient increase under most of the conditions. In factorized symmetry modes at $q=6$, domains composed of two or three states similarly follow the LAC law. Finally, this study confirmed that the choice of lattice type (square or hexagonal) and update scheme (Metropolis or Glauber) does not alter the dynamic behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soma Takemori, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems host exceptional points (EPs), where eigenstates and eigenvalues coalesce, leading to unconventional many-body phenomena absent in Hermitian systems. While NH fermionic systems with complex interactions exhibit superfluid (SF) breakdown with EPs, spin-dependent asymmetric hopping can stabilize a NH superfluid (NH-SF) that coexists with EPs. In this work, we investigate the quasi-one-dimensional NH attractive Fermi-Hubbard model by using NH BCS theory. We demonstrate that, when the system is regarded as weakly-coupled chains, the exceptional SF phase becomes unstable and metastable (exceptional) SF state appears between the stable SF and normal states. In the one-dimensional limit, the exceptional SF disappear entirely and EPs only appear on the phase boundary between the normal and SF states. These results reveal how dimensional crossover governs the stability of the exceptional SF, providing the insights into the interplay between dimensionality and dissipation, with potential relevance for experimental implications in ultracold atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. J. Butler, M. Naritsuka, T. Hanaguri</p>
            <p>The compounds 1T-TaX2 (X = S, Se) and 1T-NbSe2 have been considered as potential hosts of a quantum spin liquid phase. This is based on the widely held view that the Mott-Hubbard mechanism drives the insulating behaviour of its charge density wave ground state, resulting in localized spins, interacting antiferromagnetically, on a geometrically frustrated lattice. However this assumes layer-wise independent behaviour. A growing body of evidence shows not only that inter-layer interactions are very significant in 1T-TaS2, but also that they mediate some of its most interesting functional properties. Here we offer a perspective from the point of view of scanning tunnelling microscopy that helps to visualize the microscopic degrees of freedom of inter-layer interactions in bulk 1T-TaS2, and the associated impact on the local density-of-states, including the occurrence of multiple distinct insulating phases. We consider to what extent the bulk of 1T-TaS2, and its surface terminations can be considered as Mott insulating and whether, or where, quantum spin liquid behaviour might persist. To better understand the bulk behaviour we also draw insights from measurements on isolated monolayers of 1T-TaX2 and 1T-NbSe2, where the confounding complications of inter-layer interactions are absent. We highlight some outstanding questions raised by a comprehensive evaluation of the experimental results, and finally suggest future experiments that could address them.</p>

            <p>Structural changes induced by chemical reactions critically determine the catalytic performance and mechanism. However, precise tracking of the three-dimensional (3D) atomic structural evolution of individual bimetallic nanocatalysts remains challenging. Here we develop four-dimensional electrocatalytic atomic-resolution electron tomography, a method for directly tracking 3D atomic rearrangements in identical nanoparticles by electrocatalytic reactions. Using Pd-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles as a model system, we capture the atomic evolution of single nanocatalysts throughout electrocatalytic cycles. We observe two stages of evolutions: surface reconstruction and atom leaching, which are corroborated with the voltage-dependent behaviors probed by in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy. We identify chemical short-range order at atomic level and further reveal anisotropic chemical redistributions across different crystallographic orientations. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating 3D spatiotemporal and chemical evolutions into the rational design of functional nanocatalysts in the future.</p>

            <h2>Predicting the Curie Temperature of Magnetic Materials with Machine Learning: Descriptor Engineering, Graph Neural Networks, and the Role of Curated Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akram Abedi Orang, Mojtaba Alaei, Artem R. Oganov</p>
            <p>Predicting the Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$) of magnetic materials is crucial for advancing applications in data storage, spintronics, and sensors. We present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict $T_{\mathrm{C}}$ using a curated dataset of 2,500 ferromagnetic compounds, employing two types of elemental descriptor-based features: one based on stoichiometry-weighted descriptors, and the other leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). CatBoost trained on the stoichiometry-weighted descriptors achieved an $R^2$ score of 0.87, while the use of GNN-based representations led to a further improvement, with CatBoost reaching an $R^2$ of 0.91, highlighting the effectiveness of graph-based feature learning. We also demonstrated that using an uncurated dataset available online leads to poor predictions, resulting in a low $R^2$ score of 0.66 for the CatBoost model. We analyzed feature importance using tools such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which revealed that ionization energies are a key physicochemical factor influencing $T_\mathrm{C}$. Notably, the use of only the first 10 ionization energies as input features resulted in high predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ scores of up to 0.85 for statistical models and 0.89 for the GNN-based approach. These results highlight that combining robust ML models with thoughtful feature engineering and high-quality data, can accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials.

            <h2>Electronic-correlation-assisted charge stripe order in a Kagome superconductor</h2>

            <p>A central mystery in high-temperature cuprate superconductors is the coexistence of multiple exotic orders, which is presumably associated with strong electronic correlation. The ongoing interest in this enigmatic phenomenon is further energized when similar electronic orders and states emerge and coexist in less correlated Kagome superconductors. Here, by utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and first-principles calculations, we reveal the sudden emergence of a distinct short-range charge stripe order in Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ Kagome superconductors when the long-range $2 \times 2$ charge density wave order in pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is suppressed. This short-range stripe order features a modulation vector of approximately 1/3 along one of the three lattice directions, induces remarkable quasiparticle scattering between the original quasi-1D Kagome-d-bands and their replica of folding, and clearly suppresses the electron density of states at the Fermi level. Our first-principles calculations reveal that $3 \times 1$ supermodulation represents a hidden secondary instability in pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This instability is further enhanced by in-plane chemical pressure induced by Sn substitution, and coupled to the electronic correlation, leading to a unique charge stripe order in the system. As such, our results reveal a new route toward emergent electronic orders via cooperative interactions between the lattice and electronic degrees of freedom.</p>

            <h2>Same-group element replacement enhances superconductivity in clathrate-like YH4</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuejie Li, Yuzhou Hao, Yujie Liu, Xiaoying Wang, Turab Lookman, Jun Sun, Xiangdong Ding, Zhibin Gao</p>
            <p>H3S, LaH10, and hydrogen-based compounds have garnered significant interest due to their high-temperature superconducting properties. However, the requirement for extremely high pressures limits their practical applications. In this study, YH4 is adopted as a base material, with partial substitution of Yttrium (Y) by Scandium (Sc), Lanthanum (La), and Zirconium (Zr). Pure YH4, stable at 120 GPa, exhibits a critical temperature (Tc) of 84-95 K. Substituting half of the Y atoms increases Tc to 124.43 K for (Y,Sc)H4 at 100 GPa but reduces it to 101.24 K for (Y,La)H4 at 120 GPa. In contrast, (Y,Zr)H4 at 200 GPa shows a further suppressed Tc of 69.55 K. The remarkable superconductivity in (Y,Sc)H4 might be related to its unique phonon dispersion without optical-acoustic gap, compressed Y-H bonds, and significant electron delocalization under pressure, collectively boosting electron-phonon interactions. Furthermore, the lowest optical phonons play a crucial role in the superconductivity of these materials. This work suggests that substituting Y with same-group metal elements is an effective strategy to enhance Tc in hydride superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic flux controlled current phase relationship in double Quantum Dot Josephson junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiyan Wang, Cong Li, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>In this work, we study a Josephson junction with parallel-connected quantum dots (QDs) threaded by a magnetic flux in the central region. We discretize the superconducting (SC) electrode into three discrete energy levels and modify the tunneling coefficients to construct a finite-dimensional surrogate Hamiltonian. By directly diagonalizing this Hamiltonian, we compute the physical quantities of the system. Additionally, we employ a low-energy effective model to gain deeper physical insight. Our findings reveal that when only one QD exhibits Coulomb interaction, the system undergoes a phase transition between singlet and doublet states. The magnetic flux has a minor influence on the singlet state but significantly affects the doublet state. When both QDs have interactions, the system undergoes two phase transitions as the SC phase difference increases: the ground state evolves from a doublet to a singlet and finally into a triplet state at $\phi = \pi$. Increasing the magnetic flux suppresses the doublet and triplet phases, eventually stabilizing the singlet state. In this regime, enhancing the interaction strength does not induce a singlet-doublet transition but instead drives a transition between upper and lower singlet states, leading to a critical current peak as $U$ increases. Finally, we examine the case where the tunneling coefficient $\Gamma$ exceeds the SC pairing potential $\Delta$. Here, doublet states dominate, and the system only exhibits a phase transition between doublet and triplet states when $\phi_B = 0$. In the presence of a magnetic flux, the three states converge, resulting in a triple point in the ($\phi$, $\phi_B$) parameter space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Schätzle, Felix Hoffmann, Sven Mägdefessel, Patrik Straňák, Lutz Kirste, Peter Knittel</p>
            <p>We present an approach for the CVD growth of diamond, where the sample is placed in a defined distance from the reactor baseplate, to which the plasma couples. We observe two previously unknown growth regimes. In the first case, the sample is positioned within three to five millimeters of the plasma, leading to a decreased growth rate, compared to a position inside the plasma and, additionally, to an increased nitrogen incorporation, allowing the fabrication of delta-doped layers with a thickness below 30 nm. In another regime, where the sample is more than 10 mm away from the plasma, no growth is observed. Instead, we assume a deposition of nitrogen-rich species on the diamond surface, which is incorporated during the growth of the following layer. All fabricated layers show NV emission, where the intensity correlates with the nitrogen incorporation. The growth techniques could allow the fabrication of highly doped thin films for quantum sensing applications, as well as layers with low NV concentration, for quantum computing. The new approaches are applicable not only for nitrogen incorporation but also for other defects, for example, phosphorus, which could open up new avenues for diamond-based electronics.</p>

            <p>We present a measurement protocol and a data reduction workflow for obtaining single-crystal X-ray total-scattering datasets that capture both Bragg-peak and diffuse scattering intensities on an absolute (electrons2/atom) scale. We further demonstrate that the intensity scale factor derived from crystallographic refinements using Bragg peaks is in close agreement with that obtained by matching the scattering function, computed via spherical integration of the 3D total scattering signal, to the theoretical coherent baseline, calculated as the spherical average of the Debye-Waller factor. The latter approach can be applied to diffuse scattering without including Bragg peaks. Our results set the ground for structural refinements using large atomic configurations while simultaneously fitting Bragg intensities and diffuse scattering from a single crystal. Moreover, with the convergence between the two scaling methods, the Bragg and diffuse components can be obtained from the same total-scattering dataset, as achieved in this work, or measured independently.</p>

Our experiments reveal two processes: a structural transformation from the insulating monoclinic M1-VO$_2$ phase to the excited metallic rutile R*-VO$_2$ phase, followed by electron thermalization and relaxation dynamics intrinsic to the newly formed excited metallic phase.</p>

            <h2>The van der Waals Gap: a Hidden Showstopper in Semiconductor Device Scaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahdi Pourfath, Tibor Grasser</p>
            <p>Continued miniaturization of transistors is critical for sustaining advances in computing performance, energy efficiency, and integration density. A central nanoscale challenge is controlling gate leakage through ultrathin dielectrics. In evaluating candidate insulators, permittivity and bandgap are often emphasized; however, interfaces between two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors and gate dielectrics typically form a van der Waals (vdW) gap whose electronic properties are underappreciated. Using first-principles calculations and analytical modeling supported by experiment, we find typical vdW gaps of about 1.4 Å with an effective dielectric constant near 2, which adds roughly 2.7 Å to the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT). The vdW gap serves as an additional tunneling barrier that can reduce gate leakage by one to two orders of magnitude, but it also introduces parasitic capacitance that can offset the benefits of high-k dielectrics. We introduce a dimensionless figure of merit that combines dielectric screening, tunneling suppression, and thickness-dependent permittivity of ultrathin oxides to predict the minimum achievable EOT for a target gate-leakage current in the presence of a vdW gap. Although some materials may benefit from vdW gaps, our results indicate they often impose severe constraints on further scaling. In particular, due to the vdW gap, most currently considered insulators are unlikely to scale to an EOT of 5 Å as targeted by the IRDS roadmap for future nodes. As a potential alternative, we examine ``zippered'' structures in which quasi-covalent bonding between 2D layers eliminates the vdW gap while avoiding dangling bonds.</p>

            <h2>Linear Viscoelasticity of Dilute Solutions of Semiflexible Polymers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Varakhedkar, P. Sunthar, J. Ravi Prakash</p>
            <p>The linear viscoelastic response of dilute solutions of semiflexible polymers is studied using Brownian dynamics simulations of coarse-grained bead-spring chains. The springs obey the FENE-Fraenkel force law, a bending potential is used to capture chain stiffness and hydrodynamic interactions are included through the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor. By calculating the relaxation modulus following a step strain, we demonstrate that the bead-spring chain behaves like an inextensible semiflexible rod over a wide time window with an appropriate choice of spring stiffness and chain extensibility. In the absence of hydrodynamic interactions, our results agree with the existing theoretical predictions for the linear viscoelastic response of free-draining, inextensible, semiflexible rods in dilute solutions. It is shown that at intermediate times, the stress relaxation modulus exhibits power law behaviour, with the exponent ranging from $(-1/2)$ for flexible chains to $(-5/4)$ for highly rigid chains. At long times, rigid chains undergo orientational relaxation, while flexible chains exhibit Rouse relaxation. Hydrodynamic interactions are found to effect the behaviour at intermediate and long times, with the difference from free-draining behaviour increasing with increasing chain flexibility. Computations of the frequency dependence of loss and storage moduli are found to be in good agreement with experimental data for a wide variety of systems involving semiflexible polymers of varying stiffness across a broad frequency range.</p>

In this work, we establish a universal and exact identity from the Dyson-Schwinger equations within the Keldysh-Schwinger field theory for systems with generic bilinear interactions. Our derivation demonstrates the emergence of composite particles as "elementary excitations", whose Green's functions definitively determine the original single-particle Green's function. This universal relation uniquely identifies the composite particles governing correlations and rigorously connects their spectra to the observable single-particle spectrum. Thus, our exact identity reveals a new pathway toward a paradigm for understanding many-body correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are used in various industrial applications including dyes, inks, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, and explosives. Due to their toxicity and environmental persistence, reliable detection and monitoring methods are required. Hybrid organic--inorganic structures have shown potential for NAC sensing; however, their complex synthesis, high processing costs, and limited reproducibility hinder practical implementation, highlighting the need for simpler and more accessible materials. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to evaluate the electronic, optical, and reactive properties of two melanin-based oligomeric systems, aiming to assess their potential use as NAC detectors. Our results indicate the potential of these materials to detect a series of nitroaromatic compounds such as 2,4-DNP, 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, TNP, and TNT by electrical and infrared optical measurements. Born--Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations reveal the thermal stability of the adsorption process, confirming effective substrate--analyte interaction under different temperature conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this compound has not been proposed for sensing applications. Its low cost and facile synthesis make it a promising candidate for the development of environmentally friendly organic NAC sensors.</p>

            <h2>Arbitrary number of thermally induced phase transitions in different universality classes in $XY$ models with higher-order terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milan Žukovič</p>
            <p>We propose generalized variants of the $XY$ model capable of exhibiting an arbitrary number of phase transitions only by varying temperature. They are constructed by supplementing the magnetic coupling with $n_t-1$ nematic terms of exponentially increasing order with the base $q=2,3,4$ and $5$, and increasing interaction strength. It is found that for $q=2,3$ and $4$ with sufficiently large coupling strength of the final term, the models exhibit a number of phase transitions equal to the number of the terms in the generalized Hamiltonian. Starting from the paramagnetic phase, the system transitions through the cascade of $n_t-1$ nematic phases of the orders $q^{k}$, $k=n_t-1,n_t-2,\hdots,1$, that are characterized by $q^{k}$ preferential spin directions symmetrically disposed around the circle, to the ferromagnetic (FM) phase at the lowest temperatures. Besides the BKT transition from the paramagnetic phase, all the remaining transitions have a non-BKT nature: depending on the value of $q$ they belong to either the Ising ($q=2$ and $4$) or the three-states Potts ($q=3$) universality class. For $q=5$, due to the interplay between different terms, the phase transitions between the ordered phases observed for $q<5$ split into two and the number of the ordered phases increases to $2n_t-1$. These phases are characterized by a domain structure with the gradually increasing short-range FM ordering within domains that extends to different kinds of FM ordering in the last two low-temperature phases. The respective transitions do not seem to obey any universality.</p>

            <p>The rational combination of existing magnetic topological compounds presents a promising route for designing new topological materials. We report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization of the layered quaternary intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$, which combines structural units of two known magnetic topological materials, EuCuAs and EuZn$_2$As$_2$. Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with successive magnetic transitions: quasi-two-dimensional ordering at $T_\mathrm{M} = 29.3$\,K, long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_\mathrm{N} = 19$\,K, and spin-reorientation at $T_\mathrm{SR} = 16.3$\,K. The stepwise magnetic transitions manifest as plateau-like anomalies in the heat capacity. These transitions originate from multiple superexchange pathways and periodic variation of interplane Eu-Eu distances in the intergrowth structure. Charge transport shows a pronounced resistivity increase above $T_\mathrm{N}$ followed by minimal change below the ordering temperature. Magnetic fields rapidly suppress this resistivity rise, yielding significant negative magnetoresistance. Remarkably, Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ inherits the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect characteristic of its parent compounds. Energy evaluations of collinear spin configurations reveal a lowest-energy state with ferromagnetic coupling between Eu planes in EuCuAs units while maintaining antiferromagnetic coupling within EuZn$_2$As$_2$ units. The corresponding electronic structure displays potentially topologically nontrivial features. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of structural hybridization for discovering novel magnetic topological materials and establishes a general strategy for materials discovery.</p>

            <p>We elucidate how the strong coupling phases of a coupled driven model, originally proposed in S. Mukherjee, Phys. Rev. E 108, 024219 (2023), are affected by noise cross correlations in general dimensions $d$. This model has two dynamical variables, where one of the variables is autonomous being independent of the other, whereas the second one depends explicitly on the former. By employing model coupling theories, we study the strong coupling phase of model. We show that the scaling laws in the strong coupling phase of the second field depend strongly on the strength of the noise cross correlations: the roughness exponent of the second field varies continuously with the noise cross correlation amplitude. As the latter amplitude rises, the roughness exponent gradually decreases, suggestion a novel suppression of the fluctuations of the second field in the strong coupling phase by noise cross correlations. We discuss the phenomenological implications of our results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feodor Svetlanov Konomaev, Mithuss Tharmalingam, Kjetil M. D. Hals</p>
            <p>Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 4%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.</p>

            <p>DNA origami nanostructures provide programmable control over nanoscale geometry but remain challenging to image due to their low atomic number. Here, we systematically evaluate imaging strategies for both stained and unstained DNA origami deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids. Using Weber contrast as a quantitative metric, we compared different operating modes of (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, (S)TEM, in order to find optimum imaging conditions. STEM was consistently found to deliver the highest contrast, with optimal performance at a camera length of 600 mm towards the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. As expected, the contrast was higher for the thicker three-dimensional nanotubes as compared to DNA 6-helix bundles (6HBs) due to the larger projected thickness of the former. The contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate. Notably, 3D molds preserved their designated dimensions upon staining and also largely retained their structural integrity upon complexation with palladium, which also improved the visibility of the structures. These results establish STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami even of unstained samples and provide practical guidelines for sample preparation and imaging conditions that promote reliable structural visualization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juntao Huang, Jiabin Liu, Shaoting Lin</p>
            <p>Entangled networks are ubiquitous in tissues, polymers, and fabrics. However, their mechanics remain insufficiently understood due to the complexity of the topological constraints at the network level. Here, we develop a mathematical framework that models entangled networks as graphs, capturing topological constraints of entanglements. We prove that entanglements reduce system energy by enabling uniform tension along chains crossing entanglements and by redistributing stress through sliding. Under this framework, we study elasticity and fracture, validated by experiments on entangled fabrics and hydrogels. For elasticity, entanglements increase strength by enabling stress homogeneity in the network. For fracture, entanglements enhance toughness by mitigating stress concentration around crack tips. We discover counterintuitive physical laws governing crack-tip stretch during crack opening: stress deconcentration at small deformation, constitutive-law independence at intermediate deformation, and linear scaling at large deformation. This framework establishes fundamental principles of linking topology to mechanics of entangled networks and offers a foundational tool for designing reconfigurable materials.</p>

            <h2>Breaking of Time-Reversal Symmetry and Onsager Reciprocity in Chiral Molecule Interfacd with an Environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Fransson</p>
            <p>Molecular closed shell structures are known to form spin-singlet configurations, resulting from the spin-exchange associated with electron-electron interactions. While the vanishing total spin-moment is an immanent property of the spin-singlet, the vanishing local moments is a result of fluctuations between degenerate spin-configurations. Here, it is demonstrated that the spin-configuration of a chiral molecule is enantiospecifically locked when coupled to an electron reservoir. The coupling opens up the molecular closed shell structure, which broadens the energy levels. Together with the molecular spin-orbit coupling, this dissipative coupling generates an effective spin-splitting of the molecular energy levels and facilitates stabilization of a chirality determined spin-configuration. Simultaneously, the charge molecular charge distribution is shown to depend linearly on the magnetization of the reservoir such that no linear response regime is established with respect to the external magnetization. Accordingly, the Onsager reciprocity theorem does not apply to a chiral molecule attached to a reservoir, hence, providing a theoretical foundation for the chirality induced spin selectivity effect.</p>

            <h2>Folding-unfolding transition of active polymer on the reconfiguration of bidirectional tangential active force</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arindam Panda, Sunil P Singh</p>
            <p>The role of active stress on the conformational dynamics of a polymer has drawn significant interest due to its potential applications in understanding the energy landscape of protein structures, buckling of biopolymers, genomic spatial organization, and their large scale coherent dynamics. We present a model of bidirectional active force that acts along the polymer's tangent, with its direction stochastically reversing between head to tail and tail to head orientations. The active polymer shows a structural transition from a random coil like state to a compressed state with variations in the active force, directional (polarity) reversal rate, and their fraction. Furthermore, the polymer re-swells and stretches more than its passive limit for a large active force. The polymer's radius of gyration follows the ideal chain-like scaling relation in both the compressed and swelled states. The bidirectional active force also drives dynamical transitions, where the effective diffusivity abruptly shifts from a linear to quadratic increase. Similarly, in the regime of large activity, the linear decrease of the longest relaxation time of the polymer changes to a power law behavior. We have shown that the active polymer's conformational, relaxation, and diffusive behaviors display a transition from an active polar linear polymer model (APLP) to an active Brownian particle (ABP) polymer model with the increase in the fraction of the opposite polarity and their reconfiguration time.</p>

            <h2>Role of Oxygen during Methane Oxidation on Pd$_1$/PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$ Surface: A Combined Density Functional Theory, Microkinetic, and Machine Learning Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shalini Tomar, Hojin Jeong, Joon Hwan Choi, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee</p>
            <p>This work explores the role of oxygen in industrial methane oxidation. Oxygen, a well-known oxidizing agent, drives CH$_4$ conversion to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O. We report how oxygen influences oxidation on single Pd and PdO clusters supported on CeO$_2$(111). Oxygen is introduced by (1) lattice O in PdO and (2) O$_2$ adsorption on an isolated Pd atom, forming PdO$_x$ clusters. Density-functional theory (DFT) mapped multiple reaction pathways on the Pd$_1$/PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$(111) surface; both Pd and PdO clusters were found to thermodynamically favour methane activation. The computed barrier for CH$_4$ activation is 0.63 eV on PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$(111). A single Pd atom markedly accelerates O$_2$ dissociation to PdO$_2$, and the presence of lattice oxygen lowers this barrier by 0.36 eV relative to an oxygen-deficient surface, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Reaction selectivity, coverage-dependent production rates, degree of rate control (DRC), and intrinsic turnover frequency (TOF) were quantified through steady-state microkinetic modelling. The simulations predict full conversion of CH$_4$ to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O above 600 K, whereas partial-oxidation intermediates dominate at lower temperature and high O coverage. Rate constants for all elementary steps were derived via the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) symbolic-regression method, yielding a concise predictive expression based on charge, coordination number, and key Pd-O/C-H distances. These combined DFT-microkinetic-SISSO results clarify oxygen's mechanistic participation and provide practical guidelines for designing Pd/CeO$_2$ catalysts with improved activity toward methane oxidation, a reaction of pressing environmental and industrial importance.</p>

            <h2>Strong Disorder Renormalization Group Method for Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions: Excited States and Finite Temperature Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Kettemann</p>
            <p>We extend the recently introduced strong disorder renormalization group method in real space, well suited to study bond disordered antiferromagnetic power law coupled quantum spin chains, to study excited states, and finite temperature properties. First, we apply it to a short range coupled spin chain, which is defined by the model with power law interaction, keeping only interactions between adjacent spins. We show that the distribution of the absolute value of the couplings is the infinite randomness fixed point distribution. However, the sign of the couplings becomes distributed, and the number of negative couplings increases with temperature $T.$ Next, we derive the Master equation for the power law long range interaction between all spins with power exponent $\alpha$. While the sign of the couplings is found to be distributed, the distribution of the coupling amplitude is given by the strong disorder distribution with finite width $2\alpha,$ with small corrections for $\alpha >2$. Resulting finite temperature properties of both short and power law long ranged spin systems are derived, including the magnetic susceptibility, concurrence and entanglement entropy.</p>

            <h2>How Realistic are Idealized Copper Surfaces? A Machine Learning Study of Rough Copper-Water Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linus C. Erhard, Johannes Schörghuber, Aleix Comas-Vives, Georg K. H. Madsen</p>
            <p>Copper is a highly promising catalyst for the electrochemical CO$_2$ reduction reaction (CO2RR) since it is the only pure metal that can form highly added-value products such as ethylene and ethanol. Since the CO2RR takes place in aqueous solution, the detailed atomic structure of the water-copper interface is essential for unraveling the key reaction mechanisms. In this study, we investigate copper-water interfaces exhibiting nanometer-scale roughnesses. We introduce two molecular dynamics protocols to create rough copper surfaces, which are subsequently brought into contact with water. From these interfaces, we sample additional training configurations from machine-learning-interatomic-potential-driven molecular dynamics simulations containing hundreds of thousands of atoms. An active learning workflow is developed to identify regions with high spatially resolved uncertainty and convert them into DFT-feasible cells through a modified amorphous matrix embedding approach. Finally, we analyze the local environments at the interface using unsupervised machine-learning techniques. Unique environments emerge on the rough copper surfaces absent from model systems, including stacking-fault-induced configurations and undercoordinated corner atoms. Notably, corner atoms consistently feature chemisorbed water molecules in our simulations, indicating their potential importance in catalytic processes.</p>

            <p>Understanding the electronic structure of actinide materials is crucial for both fundamental research and nuclear applications. The partially filled 5f shells exhibit complex behavior due to strong correlations and ligand hybridization, requiring advanced spectroscopic techniques. Here, we report on the development and application of high-resolution valence-band resonant inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (VB-RIXS) experiments at the uranium M$_{4,5}$ edges (3551 and 3725\,eV). We present data of UO$_2$, a well-established model actinide compound. VB-RIXS is particularly well suited for probing the 5f-shell electronic structure, as it probes, in contrast to core-to-core RIXS, excitations without leaving a high-energy core hole in the final state. In VB-RIXS, we achieve energy resolutions of 50\,meV (M$_5$) and 90\,meV (M$_4$), enabling the resolution of multiplet excitations and crystal-field effects, as well as charge-transfer and fluorescence-like features with unprecedented clarity. As such, high resolution VB-RIXS offers direct insights into both low-energy, near ground-state properties and high-energy hybridization and covalency effects. Our results demonstrate the power of VB-RIXS as a versatile and powerful tool for probing the strongly correlated electronic structure of actinide materials, providing essential input for quantitative modeling and the validation of theoretical concepts.</p>

            <p>This study presents a machine learning approach to predict the Curie temperature in binary alloys, specifically focusing on the Fe-Pt, Fe-Ni, Fe-Pd, and Co-Pt compounds within a concentration range of 10 to 90 atomic percent. The optimal mathematical algorithm for this task is the Voting Ensemble algorithm, which combines the predictions from multiple individual models to produce a final prediction. The results are validated against classical methods for calculating Curie temperatures. The experimental findings indicate that factors such as external pressure, atomic ordering, and alloy composition have a significant influence on the Curie temperatures in all examined binary systems. These factors can be leveraged to design alloys with specific Curie temperatures. Moreover, the proposed features, feature analysis algorithms, and computational methods pave the way for advancements across various materials, including ternary alloys, bulk materials, and nanomaterials, inspiring innovation in the field.</p>

            <p>Catalysis at solid-liquid interfaces plays a central role in the advancement of energy storage and sustainable chemical production technologies. By enabling accurate, long-time scale simulations, machine learning (ML) models have the potential to accelerate the discovery of (electro)catalysts. While prior Open Catalyst datasets (OC20 and OC22) have advanced the field by providing large-scale density functional theory (DFT) data of adsorbates on surfaces at solid-gas interfaces, they do not capture the critical role of solvent and electrolyte effects at solid-liquid interfaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Open Catalyst 2025 (OC25) dataset, consisting of 7,801,261 calculations across 1,511,270 unique explicit solvent environments. OC25 constitutes the largest and most diverse solid-liquid interface dataset that is currently available and provides configurational and elemental diversity: spanning 88 elements, commonly used solvents/ions, varying solvent layers, and off-equilibrium sampling. State-of-the-art models trained on the OC25 dataset exhibit energy, force, and solvation energy errors as low as 0.1 eV, 0.015 eV/Å, and 0.04 eV, respectively; significantly lower than than the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA-OC20). Additionally, we discuss the impact of the quality of DFT-calculated forces on model training and performance. The dataset and accompanying baseline models are made openly available for the community. We anticipate the dataset to facilitate large length-scale and long-timescale simulations of catalytic transformations at solid-liquid interfaces, advancing molecular-level insights into functional interfaces and enabling the discovery of next-generation energy storage and conversion technologies.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate atomic-scale mapping of local magnetic moments and doping effects in Ti-doped barium hexaferrite (BaFe11TiO19) using atom-sized electron vortex beams (EVBs) with controlled orbital angular momentum (OAM) in a scanning transmission electron microscope. By measuring electron energy loss magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) at the Fe-L2,3 edges, we directly resolve the spatial distribution of antiparallel-aligned magnetic sublattices and quantify the impact of non-magnetic Ti4+ substitution. The EMCD signal, detected from single atomic Fe columns, reveals a marked reduction and sign reversal in the magnetic moment at Ti-rich 4f2 sites, corroborated by inelastic scattering simulations and density functional theory calculations that indicate induced Fe2+ formation and modified exchange interactions. Our results show that EVBs enable direct, element-specific, and atomically resolved magnetic characterization, opening new avenues for investigating local magnetic phenomena and dopant effects in nano-structured magnetic materials, such as those used in spintronic devices. This method paves the way for detailed studies of complex spin textures, magnetic interfaces, and dynamic processes at the atomic scale.</p>

            <h2>Random functions as data compressors for machine learning of molecular processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayashrita Debnath, Gerhard Hummer</p>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) is rapidly transforming the way molecular dynamics simulations are performed and analyzed, from materials modeling to studies of protein folding and function. ML algorithms are often employed to learn low-dimensional representations of conformational landscapes and to cluster trajectories into relevant metastable states. Most of these algorithms require selecting a small number of features that describe the problem of interest. Although deep neural networks can tackle large numbers of input features, the training costs increase with input size, which makes the selection of a subset of features mandatory for most problems of practical interest. Here, we show that random nonlinear projections can be used to compress large feature spaces and make computations faster without substantial loss of information. We describe an efficient way to produce random projections and then exemplify the general procedure for protein folding. For our test cases NTL9 and the double-norleucin variant of the villin headpiece, we find that random compression retains the core static and dynamic information of the original high dimensional feature space and makes trajectory analysis more robust.</p>

            <h2>MIM-Diode-Like Rectification in Lateral 1T/1H/1T-MoS$_2$ Homojunctions via Interfacial Dipole Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elias Eckmann, Ersoy Şaşıoğlu, Nicki F. Hinsche, Ingrid Mertig</p>
            <p>Lateral two-dimensional (2D) tunnel diodes that reproduce metal-insulator-metal (MIM)-diode-like rectification without using dissimilar contacts are attractive for scalable nanoelectronics. MoS$_2$ can exist in both the semiconducting 1H phase and the metallic 1T phase, enabling phase-engineered homojunctions within a single material. First-principles electronic structure and quantum transport calculations show that phase-engineered 1T/1H/1T--MoS$_2$ homojunctions exhibit pronounced MIM-diode-like rectification originating from interfacial charge transfer at asymmetric 1T/1H interfaces. The charge transfer establishes interface dipole steps that impose a built-in potential drop across the 1H barrier, thereby generating a trapezoidal tunnel barrier at zero bias. In contrast, symmetric 1T/1H interfaces do not form interface dipoles and show no rectification. To clarify the microscopic origin, a lateral graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene junction is analyzed as a minimal MIM diode analogue with a simple interface and well-defined barrier, confirming that interface-induced dipoles, rather than work-function difference, enable the effect. The mechanism operates entirely within a single monolayer material system and does not rely on out-of-plane stacking, highlighting compatibility with phase patterning in 2D semiconductors. These results establish lateral 1T/1H/1T--MoS$_2$ as a fully 2D, single-material platform for MIM-diode-like rectification and position interface-dipole engineering as a general strategy for ultrathin in-plane diodes, high-frequency detectors, and energy-harvesting tunnel devices.</p>

            <p>Molecular dynamics methods have proven their applicability for the reproduction and prediction of molecular conformations during the last decades. However, most of works considered dilute solutions and relatively short trajectories that limit insights into conformational dynamics. In this study, we investigate the conformational dynamics of sucrose in aqueous solution using microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations. For the most of the calculations we use the OPLS-AA/1.14*CM1A-LBCC force field, but we also utilize OPLS-AA/1.14*CM1A and GLYCAM06 for the comparison. We focused on the glycosidic linkage conformers and their lifetimes, glucopyranose and fructofuranose ring puckering. Our findings indicate that the $^1\mathrm{C}_4$ glucopyranose ring conformation can stabilize the sucrose conformer, appeared only in the GLYCAM06 and OPLS-AA/1.14*CM1A force fields. All the results are strengthened by comparison with the available experimental data on NMR J-coupling constants and ultrasonic spectra.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocal interactions are widely observed in nonequilibrium systems, from biological or sociological dynamics to open quantum systems. Despite the ubiquity of nonreciprocity, its impact on phase transitions is not fully understood. In this work, we derive criteria to perturbatively assess whether nonreciprocity changes the universality class of pairs of asymmetrically coupled systems undergoing a phase transition. These simple criteria are stated in terms of the unperturbed critical exponents, in the spirit of the Harris criterion for disordered systems, and agree with numerical simulations. Beyond nonreciprocity, our approach provides guidelines for assessing how dynamical phase transitions are affected by perturbations.</p>

Such resolution is critical for exploring thermodynamic signatures in low-dimensional materials, where conventional techniques fall short. By confining thermal excitation to microsecond timescales, this approach minimizes lateral heat diffusion, reduces heat capacity addenda to below 10^{-9} J K^{-1}, and achieves noise densities as low as 75 pJ K^{-1} Hz^{-1/2} mm^{-2}, unlocking precise thermodynamic characterization of subnanogram samples in areas as small as 30 x 30 \mu m^{2}. The method delivers exceptional temperature homogeneity, as demonstrated by resolving sharp phase transitions, such as the antiferromagnetic transition in ultrathin CoO films, with unprecedented clarity. Its quasi-static operation is inherently compatible with external stimuli, including magnetic and electric fields, thereby expanding its utility for in-operando thermodynamic studies. This advancement establishes a robust and scalable platform for probing thermal phenomena in nanostructured and low-dimensional materials, significantly broadening the scope of nanocalorimetry.</p>

            <p>The La$_2$CoIr$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_6$ double perovskite series serves as an effective platform for investigating the evolution of magnetic and electronic properties as a function of chemical pressure (doping) or hydrostatic pressure due to the interplay between the electrons correlation and spin-orbit coupling. In this study, the substitution of nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ at the magnetic Ir$^{4+}$-site leads to a systematic decrease in unit cell volume keeping the monoclinic symmetry throughout, reflecting the effect of chemical pressure along with a gradual suppression of magnetic interactions. The parent compound ($x =$ 0) exhibits a ferromagnetic-like state with a Curie temperature of 92 K, which continuously evolves into an antiferromagnetic ground state upon full Ti substitution ($x =$ 1) with a Neel temperature of 14.6 K. Isothermal magnetization measurements reveal a hysteresis behavior with step-like feature at zero field, indicative of a noncollinear magnetic ordering. Additionally, the enhancement of magnetization under hydrostatic pressure on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ suggests the presence of piezomagnetic behavior. Thermal expansion measurements on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ highlight a coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom. The pressure dependence of the transition temperature in the zero-pressure limit, calculated using Ehrenfest's relation, shows good agreement with magnetization data under applied this http URL-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations preformed for $x =$ 0, 0.5 and 1, further reveal that strong SOC associated with Ir plays a decisive role in shaping the electronic band structure, with the insulating gap progressively widening as Ti content increases from 0.28 eV ($x =$ 0), 0.44 eV ($x =$ 0.5), and 1.01 eV ($x =$ 1).

            <p>Ultracold polar molecules with microwave shielding provide a powerful platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with strong, anisotropic interactions. We develop an extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework for bosonic molecules under single microwave shielding, incorporating effective interactions and quantum fluctuations, and benchmark it against exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the regime of positive scattering lengths, our approach captures superfluid, supersolid, and droplet phases with excellent accuracy. We show that elliptic microwave polarization induces direction-dependent superfluidity - absent in cylindrically symmetric systems - enabling tunable anisotropy and potential applications in directional quantum sensing. A quasi-1D theory reveals that roton softening and instabilities can be controlled via ellipticity, consistent with recent experiments. Furthermore, we find that the nature of the superfluid-to-supersolid transition is strongly influenced by the ellipticity: the transition is sharp at low ellipticity and continuous at higher values. This tunability offers a potential route for low entropy preparation of molecular supersolids via adiabatic ramps. While double shielding is often used experimentally, our results demonstrate that single-shielded molecules already offer rich, controllable behavior, laying the groundwork for future studies with more complex shielding schemes.</p>

            <p>Understanding doped Mott insulators is a fundamental goal in condensed matter physics, with relevance to cuprate superconductors and other quantum materials. The doped Hubbard model minimally describes such systems, and has explicated some of their complex behavior. However, many open questions remain concerning the anomalous metallic states which emerge at low temperatures and intermediate doping and which, in cuprates, give rise to high-temperature superconductivity upon cooling. Here we observe a crossover between a normal metal and a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model by performing thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements in a cold atom quantum simulator, leveraging a recent several-fold reduction in experimentally achievable temperatures. Measurements of the compressibility show a maximum versus doping that develops upon cooling, signaling an inflection point in the equation of state. We track this maximum versus interaction strength, revealing a line of thermodynamic anomalies in the phase diagram that separates an underdoped from an overdoped metal at large interactions. Lattice modulation spectroscopy shows a loss of spectral weight at low energies in the underdoped regime which is non-uniform in the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of a pseudogap. We use this signal to establish a pseudogap phase diagram as a function of interactions and doping. Our results experimentally demonstrate the existence of a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model, partially characterize the pseudogap regime, and suggest a link between the pseudogap and charge order which can be probed in future work. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of quantum simulation in addressing frontier problems in correlated electron physics.</p>

            <p>Heavily doping graphene by intercalation can raise its Fermi level near an extended van Hove singularity, potentially inducing correlated electronic phases. Intercalation also modifies the band structure: dopants may hybridize with carbon orbitals and order into $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ or $2\times2$ superstructures, introducing periodic potentials that fold the graphene $\pi$ bands. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy further shows a pronounced flattening of the conduction band near the M points, producing higher-order van Hove singularities. These effects depend strongly on the dopant species and substrate, with implications for both many-body physics and transport. We construct effective tight-binding models that incorporate dopant ordering, carbon-dopant hybridization, and $\pi$-band renormalization. Model parameters are obtained from density functional theory and reproduce dispersions observed in photoemission experiments. Using these models, we compute the optical conductivity and identify characteristic signatures associated with dopant ordering and hybridization. Our results provide a framework to interpret experimental spectra and to probe the superlattice symmetry of highly doped monolayer graphene.</p>

            <p>The potential for reactive metal fuels to enhance the energetic output of high explosives has generated an enduring interest in the study of composite explosives. It has typically been demonstrated that added metal fuels can have little or even deleterious impact on the accelerating ability of composite military explosives relative to baseline performance. Often this has led to the assumption of limited reaction of the metal fuel over microsecond timescales. The widespread availability of Photonic Doppler Velocimetry has enabled time resolved measurement of accelerated confinement, ultimately demonstrating prompt reaction of metal fuels. Motivated by this observation, hydrocode modelling studies, and prior author's modifications of Taylor's tubular bomb model, we developed a differential equation form of Taylor's model in a manner where it is straightforward to add sources or phases. An afterburning version of the JWL equation of state was used to add energy to the gaseous products at a linear, time-dependent rate. The metal particles are assumed to remain in velocity equilibrium with the gaseous products and do not transfer heat or influence chemical composition. We focus exclusively on added aluminum as it remains the most ubiquitous choice of metal fuel. The model is initialized with a CJ state calculated from Cheetah 2.0 assuming the Al particles are inert in the detonation. JWL coefficients for the baseline explosive are also used.

            <h2>Vibrational Fingerprints of Strained Polymers: A Spectroscopic Pathway to Mechanical State Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Konrad, Janina Mittelhaus, David M. Wilkins, Bodo Fiedler, Robert Meißner</p>
            <p>The vibrational response of polymer networks under load provides a sensitive probe of molecular deformation and a route to non-destructive diagnostics. Here we show that machine-learned force fields reproduce these spectroscopic fingerprints with quantum-level fidelity in realistic epoxy thermosets. Using MACE-OFF23 molecular dynamics, we capture the experimentally observed redshifts of para-phenylene stretching modes under tensile load, in contrast to the harmonic OPLS-AA model. These shifts correlate with molecular elongation and alignment, consistent with Badger's rule, directly linking vibrational features to local stress. To capture IR intensities, we trained a symmetry-adapted dipole moment model on representative epoxy fragments, enabling validation of strain responses. Together, these approaches provide chemically accurate and computationally accessible predictions of strain-dependent vibrational spectra. Our results establish vibrational fingerprints as predictive markers of mechanical state in polymer networks, pointing to new strategies for stress mapping and structural-health diagnostics in advanced materials.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Asymmetry for Higher and Noninvertible Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Benini, Pasquale Calabrese, Michele Fossati, Amartya Harsh Singh, Marco Venuti</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is an observable in quantum systems, constructed using quantum-information methods, suited to detecting symmetry breaking in states -- possibly out of equilibrium -- relative to a subsystem. In this paper we define the asymmetry for generalized finite symmetries, including higher-form and noninvertible ones. To this end, we introduce a "symmetrizer" of (reduced) density matrices with respect to the $C^*$-algebra of symmetry operators acting on the subsystem Hilbert space. We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.</p>

            <h2>Subtleties in the pseudomodes formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wynter Alford, Laetitia P. Bettmann, Gabriel T. Landi</p>
            <p>The pseudomode method for open quantum systems, also known as the mesoscopic leads approach, consists in replacing a structured environment by a set of auxiliary "pseudomodes" subject to local damping that approximate the environment's spectral density. Determining what parameters and geometry to use for the auxiliary modes, however, is non-trivial and involves many subtleties. In this paper we revisit this problem of pseudomode design and investigate some of these subtleties. In particular, we examine the scenario in which pseudomodes couple to each other, resulting in an effective spectral density that is no longer a sum of Lorentzians. We show that non-diagonalizability of the pseudomodes' effective single-particle non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can lead to terms in the effective spectral density which cannot be obtained by diagonalizable non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We also present a method for constructing the pseudomode parameters to exactly match a fit to a spectral density, and in doing so illuminate the enormous freedom in this process. The case of many uncoupled pseudomodes is explored, and we show how, contrary to conventional assumption, the effective spectral density does not necessarily converge in the limit of an infinite number of pseudomodes; we attribute this to the non-completeness of Lorentzians as basis functions. Finally, we discuss how the notion of effective spectral densities can also emerge in the context of scattering theory for non-interacting systems.</p>

In the present work, we extend this novel interaction scheme to various thermodynamical systems in order to test the universality of the proposed law. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of these systems also exhibit chaotic behavior under different conditions. We discussed the relationship between chaotic dynamics and the least action, and for the first time, we proposed the "Chaotic Action Principle" (CAP). Furthermore, we examined the validity of the physical and philosophical foundations of this new law and the associated definition of chaos. Finally, based on CAP, we proposed a new conceptual definition of complexity.</p>

We illustrate the result by examples and show that existing probabilistic representations of the invariant measures of non equilibrium interacting particle systems can be obtained from the matrix product ansatz by this general procedure.</p>

            <p>The growing energy demands of information and communication technologies, driven by data-intensive computing and the von Neumann bottleneck, underscore the need for energy-efficient alternatives. Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices have emerged as promising candidates for beyond von Neumann computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic computing, offering voltage-history-dependent switching that mimics synaptic and neural behaviors. Atomic-scale mechanisms, such as defect-driven filament formation and ionic transport, govern these switching processes. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of Tantalum Oxide based RRAM devices featuring both oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient switching layers. We analyze the dominant conduction mechanisms underpinning resistive switching and systematically evaluate how oxygen stoichiometry influences device behavior. Leveraging a bottom-up design methodology, we link material composition to electrical performance metrics-such as endurance, cycle-to-cycle variability, and multilevel resistance states-providing actionable guidelines for optimizing RRAM architectures for energy-efficient memory and computing applications.</p>

            <h2>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Atomistic Learning for "Clusters-to-Bulk" Generalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikołaj J. Gawkowski, Mingjia Li, Benjamin X. Shi, Venkat Kapil</p>
            <p>Training machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) on total energies of molecular clusters using differential or transfer learning is becoming a popular route to extend the accuracy of correlated wave-function theory to condensed phases. A key challenge, however, lies in validation, as reference observables in finite-temperature ensembles are not available at the reference level. Here, we construct synthetic reference data from pretrained MLIPs and evaluate the generalizability of cluster-trained models on ice-Ih, considering scenarios where both energies and forces and where only energies are available for training. We study the accuracy and data-efficiency of differential, single-fidelity transfer, and multi-fidelity transfer learning against ground-truth thermodynamic observables. We find that transferring accuracy from clusters to bulk requires regularization, which is best achieved through multi-fidelity transfer learning when training on both energies and forces. By contrast, training only on energies introduces artefacts: stable trajectories and low energy errors conceal large force errors, leading to inaccurate microscopic observables. More broadly, we show that accurate reproduction of microscopic structure correlates strongly with low force errors but only weakly with energy errors, whereas global properties such as energies and densities correlate with low energy errors. This highlights the need to incorporate forces during training or to apply careful validation before production. Our results highlight the promise and pitfalls of cluster-trained MLIPs for condensed phases and provide guidelines for developing - and critically, validating - robust and data-efficient MLIPs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liav Daraf, Yael Lavi, Areej Saleem, Daniel Sevilla Sanchez, Yuri Feldman, Lior Atia</p>
            <p>With the completion of development and wound repair, as the epithelium approaches homeostasis, cell proliferation is reduced to a minimum. In parallel, cellular motion transitions from a migratory unjammed state to a quiescent jammed state. This quiescent state is commonly regarded as devoid of large-scale regional variations in cell-cycle re-entry and cellular mechanics. To the contrary, here we report that during late maturation there arises a heretofore unanticipated epithelial reticulum that is supracellular and spans multiple scales of length. This reticulum evolves dynamically and comprises two interpenetrating networks: large regions of cycling and mechanically tensed cells, embedded with islands of non-cycling and mechanically compressed cells. The islands of compressed cells emerge and grow in cell numbers, with gradual jamming and with reduced cellular rearrangements. We show how island growth is both reversible, by provoking unjamming, and detainable, by cell cycle arrest treatment. Moreover, the distribution of island sizes was found to conform to a power-law, thus leading us to employ a computational model of percolating critical networks. Together, the observations indicate that the newly discovered epithelial reticulum self-organizes close to but just shy of criticality - thus avoiding mergers of compressed cell islands. This quasi-criticality reframes epithelial homeostasis as a dynamic regional balance of forces and proliferation.</p>

            <h2>Navigating entanglement via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida exchange: Snake, bouncing, boundary-residing, pulse, and damping-stabilized time-frozen trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Son-Hsien Chen, Seng Ghee Tan, Ching-Ray Chang</p>
            <p>Entanglement dynamics are fundamental to quantum technologies, yet navigating their temporal profiles (trajectories) remains challenging. Here, we propose a scalable solid-state platform based on RKKY exchange, where two spin qubits couple to a central spin qudit that oscillatorily spin-polarizes the surrounding conduction electrons. We introduce the exchange-time integral (ETI), which maps the spatial motion of the qubits to a time-dependent exchange interaction and serves as an effective "trajectory clock" governing the system evolution. We focus specifically on entanglement trajectories initially near the entanglement-unentanglement boundary, with the distance to this boundary quantified by concurrence extended to include negative values. By alternating the sign changes of the exchange, implemented through vibrational motion of qubits, the ETI enables programmable entanglement trajectories. For in-phase and antiphase vibrations, including scenarios with controlled stopping at the RKKY exchange-free nodes, we identify distinctive trajectories: snake (repeatedly crossing the boundary), bouncing (immediately reversing upon reaching the boundary), boundary-residing (remaining at the transition point), and pulse (controllable entanglement intervals). The vibration phase creates asymmetric shifts to the trajectories. The proposed device offers built-in error correction against dephasing by utilizing both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes. Out-of-phase vibrations drive trajectories away from the boundary, accessing larger entanglement values but with irregular/unsteady final states. To stabilize these trajectories, we introduce a damping mechanism. Our framework offers a systematic method for navigating and engineering entanglement dynamics in quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum computation, cryptography, and metrology.</p>

            <p>Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.</p>

            <h2>Going beyond Landauer: Information-cost relations from inference based on the maximum entropy principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanyuan Xiao, Jian-Hua Jiang, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only partial information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost in scenarios with multiple charges, which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound; and (ii) an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in observable fluctuations which are ubiquitous at nanoscale, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.</p>

            <p>The gyromagnetic ratio and Pauli form factor are important quantities that characterize the electric and magnetic moment distribution of a particle. The experimentally measured value for the gyromagnetic ratio or the spin g-factor of an electron in a vacuum agrees remarkably well with theoretical predictions, making it one of the biggest successes of quantum field theory. However, these factors may get modified compared to their vacuum counterparts due to the interaction present in the system. Motivating from that, in this article, we investigate the effects of interactions within the framework of $2+1$ dimensional Proca quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate how the g-factor and Pauli form factors change with the electron's Fermi velocity and the mass of the vector fields within Proca quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <p>The functionalization of quantum devices to increase their performance and extend their fields of application is an extremely active research area. One of the most promising approaches is to replace aluminum with more performant materials. Within this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials are ideal candidates since they would allow to embed their unique properties into qubits. However, the realization of qubits based on vdW materials other than graphene is yet to be achieved. In this work we present a weakly anharmonic NbSe2 qubit. Our device exhibits a relaxation time T1 = 6.5 +\- 0.4 us which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude larger of other vdW qubits in addition to robustness to photon noise up to 5-10 thermal photons. Our work serves as a demonstrator of the advantage of integration of vdW materials into quantum technologies as well as serving as the first step toward the application of quantum non demolition photon detection protocols in the challenging field of dark matter search.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Fresnel Wave Surfaces: Off-Shell Photonic Density of States and Near-Fields in Isotropy-Broken Materials with Loss or Gain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Durach, David Keene</p>
            <p>Fresnel wave surfaces, or isofrequency light shells, provide a powerful framework for describing electromagnetic wave propagation in anisotropic media, yet their applicability is restricted to reciprocal, lossless materials and far-field radiation. This paper extends the concept by incorporating near-field effects and non-Hermitian responses arising in media with loss, gain, or non-reciprocity. Using the Om-potential approach to macroscopic electromagnetism, we reinterpret near fields as off-shell electromagnetic modes, in analogy with off-shell states in quantum field theory. We show that photonic density of states (PDOS) distributions near Fresnel surfaces acquire Lorentzian broadening in non-reciprocal media, directly linking this effect to the Beer-Bouguer-Lambert law of exponential attenuation or amplification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how Abraham and Minkowski momenta, locked to light shells in the far field, naturally shift to characterize source structures in the near-field regime. This unified treatment bridges the gap between sources and radiation, on-shell and off-shell modes, and reciprocal and non-reciprocal responses. The framework provides both fundamental insight into structured light and practical tools for the design of emitters and metamaterial platforms relevant to emerging technologies such as 6G communications, photonic density-of-states engineering, and non-Hermitian photonics.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</p>

            <p>Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is the most common neuropathic disorder; however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. A prevailing theory suggests that nitric oxide (NO) may induce nerve compression and irritation via vascular dilation, thereby being responsible for the condition, making real-time detection of generated NO critical. However, traditional evaluations of NO rely on indirect colorimetric or chemiluminescence techniques, which offer limited sensitivity and spatial resolution for its real-time assessment in biological environments. Herein, we reported the development of a highly sensitive NO electrochemical biosensor based cerium single-atom nanozyme (Ce1-CN) with ultrawide linear range from 1.08 nM to 143.9 {\mu}M, and ultralow detection limit of 0.36 nM, which enables efficient and real-time evaluation of NO in TN rats. In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed the high-performance biosensing mechanism, whereby the Ce centers in Ce1-CN nanoenzymes adsorb NO and subsequently react with OH- to form *HNO2. Results demonstrated that NO concentration was associated with TN onset. Following carbamazepine treatment, NO production from nerves decreased, accompanied by an alleviation of pain. These findings indicate that the biosensor serves as a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis of TN and guiding subsequent therapeutic strategies.</p>

            <p>Although the homotopy-knot theory has been utilized to implement effective topological classification for non-Hermitian systems, the physical implications underlying distinct knot topologies remain ambiguous and are rarely addressed. In this work, we propose a one-dimensional non-Hermitian four-band lattice model and map out its phase diagram according to the distinct knot structures residing in the moment space. The topological phase diagram is ascertained through a spectral winding number. Furthermore, we derive the exact analytic formula for the phase boundaries that delineate different knot topologies. To explore the concrete physical implications of distinct knot topologies, we investigate the many-body ground state entanglement entropy for free fermions loaded on such non-Hermitian lattice in real space. It turns out that different knot topologies imply different magnitudes of entanglement. Moreover, we show that the central charge c extracted from systematic finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy provides effective description of the phase diagram of the knot topology. Finally, we further confirm the phase boundaries for the topological phase transitions alternatively by numerical calculations of the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility. Our results showcase the connection between knot topology and entanglement of non-Hermitian systems and may facilitate further exploration of the profound and practical physical implications of knot topology.</p>

            <p>Dynamic stability is vital for the operation and control of molecular nanodevices, particularly molecular cogwheels in an external harmonic field. We used the relative change in rotator entropy as a measure of dynamical stability. This rotator dynamic is described by the Caldeira-Leggett quantum master equation: the main challenge is the absence of a general solution for this equation. As an alternative, we look for the initial states (pure or mixed) of the rotator that result in low entropy change. In order to create candidate initial states, we use an ansatz that align with the maximum entropy principle. We then find conditions for state preparation and system/bath parameters to achieve a small relative change in both linear and differential entropy in underdamped and non-underdamped regimes. We identify cases with relatively small entropy change and discuss their practical feasibility.</p>

Depending on the parameters, lasers can offer versatile solutions for scientific and industrial applications, starting from exploring the fundamental physics of warm dense matter and molecular chemistry at ultrashort timescales to large-scale fabrication of surfaces with anti-bacterial, tribological, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic properties. The objectives of this Chapter are to provide a review of recent advancements in several laser application fields, which involve high-intensity lasers, both ultrashort (femto- and picosecond) and short (nanosecond). After summarizing general trends in high-intensity laser processing of materials, we will first focus on the new opportunities offered by high-intensity lasers for the controlled synthesis of multielement nanoparticles for catalytic and theranostic applications. Then, the blister-based laser-induced forward transfer (BB-LIFT) technique will be presented, allowing a one-step, high-precision printing of nanomaterials on any substrates. The next section will discuss the selective crystallization of amorphous (as prepared) semiconductor nanoscale materials. The processes enabling high selectivity of crystallization into the desired phase using ultrashort powerful lasers will be analyzed. After that, opportunities for using high-power lasers will be discussed for upscaling surface nanostructuring with high throughput for bio-medical and industrial applications. Finally, an introduction to the Open Access program of the HiLASE Centre, which is targeted at offering users high-intensity beam time, will be given.</p>

            <p>We introduce a data-driven approach for extracting two-level system (TLS) parameters-frequency $\omega_{TLS}$, coupling strength $g$, dissipation time $T_{TLS, 1}$, and the pure dephasing time $T^{\phi}_{TLS, 2}$, labelled as a 4-component vector $\vec{q}$, directly from simulated spectroscopy data generated for a single TLS by a form of two-tone spectroscopy. Specifically, we demonstrate that a custom convolutional neural network model(CNN) can simultaneously predict $\omega_{TLS}$, $g$, $T_{TLS, 1}$ and $T^{\phi}_{TLS, 2}$ from the spectroscopy data presented in the form of images. Our results show that the model achieves superior performance to perturbation theory methods in successfully extracting the TLS parameters. Although the model, initially trained on noise-free data, exhibits a decline in accuracy when evaluated on noisy images, retraining it on a noisy dataset leads to a substantial performance improvement, achieving results comparable to those obtained under noise-free conditions. Furthermore, the model exhibits higher predictive accuracy for parameters $\omega_{TLS}$ and $g$ in comparison to $T_{TLS, 1}$ and $T^{\phi}_{TLS, 2}$.</p>

            <h2>Nonlocal Electrostatics and Boundary Charges in Continuum Limits of Two-Dimensional Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoham Sen, Yang Wang, Timothy Breitzman, Kaushik Dayal</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) electronic materials are of significant technological interest due to their exceptional properties and broad applicability in engineering. The transition from nanoscale physics, that dictates their stable configurations, to macroscopic engineering applications requires the use of multiscale methods to systematically capture their electronic properties at larger scales. A key challenge in coarse-graining is the rapid and near-periodic variation of the charge density, which exhibits significant spatial oscillations at the atomic scale. Therefore, the polarization density field -- the first moment of the charge density over the periodic unit cell -- is used as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by exploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. Unlike the highly oscillatory charge density, the polarization varies over lengthscales that are much larger than the atomic, making it suitable for continuum modeling. In this paper, we investigate the electrostatic potential arising from the charge distribution of 2D materials. Specifically, we consider a sequence of problems wherein the underlying lattice spacing vanishes and thus obtain the continuum limit. We consider 3 distinct limits: where the thickness is much smaller than, comparable to, and much larger than the in-plane lattice spacing. These limiting procedures provide the homogenized potential expressed in terms of the boundary charge and dipole distribution, subject to the appropriate boundary conditions that are also obtained through the limit process. Further, we demonstrate that despite the intrinsic non-uniqueness in the definition of polarization, accounting for the boundary charges ensures that the total electrostatic potential, the associated electric field, and the corresponding energy of the homogenized system are uniquely determined.</p>

            <p>To achieve a fault-tolerant quantum computer, it is crucial to increase the coherence time of quantum bits. In this work, we theoretically investigate a system consisting of a series of superconducting qubits that alternate between XX and YY ultrastrong interactions. By considering the two-lowest energy eigenstates of this system as a {\it logical} qubit, we demonstrate that its coherence is significantly enhanced: both its pure dephasing and relaxation times are extended beyond those of individual {\it physical} qubits. Specifically, we show that by increasing either the interaction strength or the number of physical qubits in the chain, the logical qubit's pure dephasing rate is suppressed to zero, and its relaxation rate is reduced to half the relaxation rate of a single physical qubit. Single qubit and two-qubit gates can be performed with a high fidelity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Gotta</p>
            <p>In this work, we undertake the problem of formally introducing a notion of quantum many-body scarring in open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad equation. To this goal, we rely on the commutant-algebra framework for the description of strong symmetries to introduce the unconventional strong-symmetry structure leading to the existence of anomalous stationary states, which we dub open-system quantum many-body scars (OSQMBS), besides a typical infinite-temperature state. We provide several benchmarks of the theoretical predictions on the stationary-state manifold and on convergence to stationarity, as well as describe the time-evolution of off-diagonal coherences among the Hilbert space symmetry sectors identified by OSQMBS and their orthogonal complement. Moreover, we investigate the existence of asymptotic OSQMBS (AOSQMBS), the latter being states that, despite converging to the typical infinite-temperature state in the large-time limit, display anomalously-large relaxation time scales, which we thoroughly describe by means of the behavior of their fidelity as a function of time through proper scaling Ansaetze.</p>

            <p>We study intriguing dynamical features of hot Rubidium atoms driven by two light fields. The fields resonantly drive multiple Zeeman states within two hyperfine levels, yielding a cascaded-$\Lambda$ like structure in the frequency space. A non-Hermitian Floquet tight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping between the nearest states effectively describes the coherence dynamics between Zeeman states within the ground hyperfine manifold. By performing spin noise spectroscopy, we observe higher harmonic peaks in the noise spectrum that capture multi-photon transitions in the ground manifold. Moreover, the peak amplitudes reveal a power-law decay of long-range coherence with increasing separation between the ground states.</p>

            <h2>The Many Faces of Non-invertible Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shadi Ali Ahmad, Marc S. Klinger, Yifan Wang</p>
            <p>We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Thermal field theory correlators in the large-$N$ limit and the spectral duality relation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sašo Grozdanov, Mile Vrbica</p>
            <p>In Ref.~\cite{Grozdanov:2024wgo}, we derived a spectral duality relation applicable to the spectra of 3$d$ conformal field theories (CFTs) and their holographically dual 4$d$ black holes. In this work, we further elaborate on the properties of this duality relation and argue that the same relation can be applied to certain pairs of thermal correlator spectra in large-$N$ quantum field theories in any number of spacetime dimensions, provided the correlators are meromorphic functions with only simple poles and satisfy the thermal product formula. We discuss a rich set of properties that such retarded two-point functions must exhibit. We then show that the spectral duality relation and its implications apply to pairs of correlators in double-trace deformed CFTs and, more generally, to correlators in theories related by the Legendre transform. We illustrate, through several examples, how the spectrum of one correlator can be reconstructed from that of its dual correlation function. Notably, this includes cases relating the thermal spectra of scalar primary operators at ultraviolet and infrared fixed points, as well as current operators in a CFT$_3$ and its particle-vortex dual.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason Cantarella, Tetsuo Deguchi, Clayton Shonkwiler, Erica Uehara</p>
            <p>A ring polymer is a random walk whose steps obey a single linear condition; their sum vanishes. Factoring the graph Laplacian into the product of the incidence matrix and its transpose allows us to show that for a more complicated network, the steps must lie in a linear subspace determined by the graph topology. This provides a useful new perspective on the James--Guth theory of phantom elastic networks. In particular, we formulate phantom networks which are free from the constraints of fixed crosslinks. For a given network the solution of the loop constraints makes the partition function finite-valued in the path integral formulation without applying any external forces or fixing any monomer positions. The resulting probability distribution on edge displacements is rotationally invariant, which is practically quite useful for generating unbiased random samples of edge displacements and monomer positions. Furthermore, one can exactly calculate many physical quantities such as correlation functions with respect to this distribution. Finally, this reformulation lends itself well to the case of non-Gaussian distributions. We illustrate this by computing the expected radius of gyration of a ring polymer in a wide variety of models.</p>

            <p>Critically elastic materials - those that are rigid with a single state of self-stress - can be generated from parent systems with two states of self-stress by the removal of one of many constraints. We show that the elastic moduli of the resulting homogeneous and isotropic daughter systems are interrelated by a universal functional form parametrized by properties of the parent. In simulations of both spring networks and packings of soft spheres, judicious choice of parent systems and bond removal allows for the selection of a wide variety of moduli and Poisson's ratios in the critically elastic systems, providing a framework for versatile deterministic selection of mechanical properties.</p>

            <p>Periodically driven systems often exhibit behavior distinct from static systems. In single-particle, static systems, any amount of disorder generically localizes all eigenstates in one dimension. In contrast, we show that in topologically nontrivial, single-particle Floquet loop drives with chiral symmetry in one dimension, a localization-delocalization transition occurs as the time $t$ is varied within the driving period ($0 \le t \le \td$). We find that the time-dependent localization length $\lloc(t)$ diverges with a universal exponent as $t$ approaches the midpoint of the drive: $\lloc(t) \sim (t - \td/2)^{-\nu}$ with $\nu=2$. We provide analytical and numerical evidence for the universality of this exponent within the AIII symmetry class.</p>

            <p>Recently, [DOI:https://doi.org/10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1] considered spin glass models with additional conventional order parameters characterizing single-replica properties.

We rigorously verify this prescription in the setting of vector spin glass models featuring additional deterministic spin interactions.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihao Liu, Shengnan Zhang, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, Quansheng Wu</p>
            <p>Unusual magnetotransport behaviors, such as temperature-dependent negative magnetoresistance (MR) and bowtie-shaped MR, have puzzled us for a long time. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena, the absence of comprehensive quantitative calculations has made these explanations less convincing. In our work, we introduce a methodology to study magnetotransport behaviors in magnetic materials. This approach integrates the anomalous Hall conductivity induced by the Berry curvature, with a multi-band ordinary conductivity tensor, employing a combination of first-principles calculations and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Our method also incorporates the temperature dependence of the relaxation time and the anomalous Hall conductivity, as well as the field dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity. We initially test this approach on models, obtaining distinct behaviors of magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity across several types of magnetic materials, and then apply it to a Weyl semimetal, Co3Sn2S2. The results, which align well with experimental observations in terms of magnetic field and temperature dependencies, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. This methodology provides a comprehensive and efficient means to understand the underlying mechanisms of the unusual complex behaviors observed in magnetotransport measurements in magnetic materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> ShengNan Zhang, Zhihao Liu, Hanqi Pi, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, QuanSheng Wu</p>
            <p>The Hall effect, ever intriguing since its discovery, has spurred the exploration of its phenomena, intensified by advances in topology and novel materials. Differentiating the ordinary Hall effect from extraordinary properties like the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is challenging, especially in materials with topological origins. In our study, we leverage semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory and first-principles calculations within the relaxation time approximation to analyze Hall effects comprehensively. We have found that the complex magnetic field dependence of ordinary Hall effect, including the sign reversals, appearing of plateau and nonlinearity, can be understood and reproduced by our approach both for multiband models and realistic topological materials of ZrSiS and PtTe2. The Hall resistivity versus temperature and magnetic fields can be well scaled, similar to Kohler's rule for longitudinal resistivity. This methodology can also accurately model the angular dependent Hall effects such as planar Hall effects of bismuth. These findings indicate that the dependencies of various Hall effects and magnetoresistance on magnetic fields are mainly determined by the details of Fermi surface and the relaxation time. The intrinsic Fermi surface determines the carriers' density, type, and velocity, while the later is mostly influenced by extrinsic factors, such as quality of sample with defects, impurities, and domains. This insight might simplify the understanding of several seemingly complex transport phenomena in nonmagnetic materials, with no need for hypotheses of other sophisticated mechanisms, such as magnetization-induced AHE, Lifshitz transition-induced changes in carrier type, exotic orders like charge density wave, or some delicate scattering of carriers with chiral or nonreciprocal dependence. Finally, we also discussed the Hall effects contribute from the Berry curvature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Han Teng, Anna Grünebohm</p>
            <p>Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and as their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we show that the recoverable stored energy can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase due to a pinched double-loop field hysteresis.</p>

            <p>We study the statistical physics of the classical Ising model in the so-called $\alpha$-Rényi ensemble, a finite-temperature thermal state approximation that minimizes a modified free energy based on the $\alpha$-Rényi entropy. We begin by characterizing its critical behavior in mean-field theory in different regimes of the Rényi index $\alpha$. Next, we re-introduce correlations and consider the model in one and two dimensions, presenting analytical arguments for the former and devising a Monte Carlo approach to the study of the latter. Remarkably, we find that while mean-field predicts a continuous phase transition below a threshold index value of $\alpha \sim 1.303$ and a first-order transition above it, the Monte Carlo results in two dimensions point to a continuous transition at all $\alpha$. We conclude by performing a variational minimization of the $\alpha$-Rényi free energy using a recurrent neural network (RNN) ansatz where we find that the RNN performs well in two dimensions when compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Our work highlights the potential opportunities and limitations associated with the use of the $\alpha$-Rényi ensemble formalism in probing the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of classical and quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) have been used in spintronic applications to decrease the magnetic field or the electric current required to act on the magnetization. A common belief is that a SAW alone cannot achieve a directed magnetic switching in a device without an assisting magnetic field or electric current. In this work, we demonstrate magnetic domain wall motion driven solely by an acoustic wave. Using XMCD-PEEM, we show extensive evidence of SAW-induced and field-free magnetic domain wall motion (DW) in the direction of the wave propagation. Our micromagnetic simulations reveal a mechanism that allows the SAW to transfer linear momentum to the DW. Experimentally, the largest DW average velocity measured was ~12 m/s, although our simulations predict that velocities in the range of 100 m/s could be attained. This new mechanism opens the door to designing innovative spintronic devices where the magnetization can be controlled exclusively by an acoustic wave.</p>

            <p>The slime mould Physarum polycephalum has emerged as a model for self-organisation and coordination of contractile activity at large spatial scales. This self-organisation largely results from cytoplasmic flows generated by propagating contractile waves of the actomyosin cortex. In addition to these relatively fast travelling waves, complex slow modulations of the contractile activity have been observed on timescales much longer than the primary oscillation period; these slow dynamics are however scarcely characterised. Here we characterise these slow modulations by confining organisms inside annular geometries. We quantify contractile activity simultaneously across the entire organism on long time scales, exhibiting correlations between contractile wave direction, amplitude modulation, and the moving mean vein diameter. We observe travelling and alternating wave patterns: travelling wave periods scale clearly with system size, while alternating wave periods remain broadly distributed and probe larger values as the system size increases. Strikingly, the measured periods align with integer multiples of an intrinsic modulation time scale obtained independently from statistical analysis. These observations support the hypothesis that transport of a slowly advected chemical agent, which locally modifies membrane/cortex mechanical properties, underpins the observed slow modulation dynamics, accounting for the coordination across the organism on long time scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. M. Sandratskii, K. Carva, V. M. Silkin</p>
            <p>We suggest the method for direct ab initio calculation of magnons in complex collinear magnets. The method is based on the density-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints: one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect to the ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsible for the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the method is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An important role in both the formulation and the application of the method play the aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. The symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following three parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry of the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio calculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in the ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon excitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of the electron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons have identical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since the altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Te atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis and calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. The knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to accelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as a test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection between electron band structures of the magnon states of the system and the chirality properties of these states we investigate the transformation of the electron structure in the transition from the collinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state.</p>

            <p>We study the relaxation time of a generic plasma which is perturbed by means of a time-dependent pulsed force. This time pulse is modelled using a Gaussian superposition. During such a pulse two forces are considered: An inhomogeneous oscillating electric force and the corresponding ponderomotive force. The evolution of that ensemble is driven by the Boltzmann Equation, and the perturbed population is described by a power-law distribution function. In this work, as a new feature, instead the usual techniques the transient between both distributions is analysed using the moments of such distribution function and the Central Limit Theorem. This technique, together with the, ad hoc solved, equation of motion of the charges under this particular system of pulsed forces, allows to find the corresponding expressions relating the time pulse with the relaxation times and the dynamic conditions. We validate that new technique by comparison with the analytical expression using the corresponding relaxation time using an exact collision operator. Moreover, we parameterise this plasma to make numerical estimates in order to analyse the impact of relevant parameters involved in the physical process on such a relaxation time.</p>

            <p>The experimental determination of the magnitude and momentum dependence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is an outstanding problem in condensed matter physics. The intensity of phonon peaks in Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) spectra can be related to the underlying EPC strength under significant approximations whose validity deserves careful verification. We measured the Cu L$_3$ RIXS phonon intensity as function of incident photon energy and of momentum transfer in several layered cuprates. For CaCuO$_2$, La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, and \ch{YBa_2Cu_3O_{6}}, using a generally accepted theoretical model, we estimate quantitatively the EPC for the bond-stretching mode along the high-symmetry directions ($\zeta$,0) and ($\zeta$,$\zeta$), and as a function of the azimuthal angle $\varphi$ at fixed $q_\parallel$. We compare our results with theoretical predictions and we find that the $\mathbf{q}_\parallel$-dependence of the phonon RIXS intensity can be largely ascribed to the phonon symmetry. However, a more satisfactory prediction of the experimental results requires an accurate description of the electronic structure close to the Fermi level. Our extensive investigation indicates that Cu L$_3$ RIXS can be reliably used to determine the momentum dependence of EPC for the bond-stretching modes of cuprates. Moreover, the large experimental basis provided in this article can serve as stringent test for advanced theoretical predictions on the EPC.</p>

Under moderate hole doping, when the $d_{z^2}$ bonding band becomes incipient or crosses the Fermi level, robust $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity emerges from cooperative interlayer pairing reinforced by two competing spin-density-wave fluctuations. Compressive strain favors superconductivity in NiO$_2$ bilayers slightly away from the interface, whereas tensile strain induces pair-breaking nesting that suppresses pairing. Our results establish a unified microscopic scenario for superconductivity in pressurized bulk and strained thin-film nickelates, providing new insights into high-T$_c$ pairing in correlated quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic entropic uncertainty relation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa, Tomohiro Nishiyama</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of a trajectory observable and entropy production, where the uncertainty of the observable is quantified by its variance. In information theory, Shannon entropy is a common measure of uncertainty. However, a clear quantitative relationship between the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics remains to be established. In this Letter, we show that an uncertainty relation can be formulated in terms of the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution requires higher entropy production. Specifically, we establish that the sum of the entropy production and the symmetry entropy cannot be less than $\ln 2$. As a corollary, we also prove that the sum of the entropy production and the Shannon entropy of the observable is no less than $\ln 2$. As an application, we demonstrate our relation in the diffusion decision model, revealing a fundamental trade-off between decision accuracy and entropy production in stochastic decision-making processes.</p>

            <h2>Emergent quasi-particles of spin-1 trimer chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manodip Routh, Anutosh Biswas, Manoranjan Kumar</p>
            <p>The recent experimental realization of emergent quasi-particles, such as spinons, doublons, and quartons, in a spin-$1/2$ trimer chain has spurred new interest in low dimensional magnetic systems. In this study, we investigate the dynamical properties of the isotropic spin-$1$ trimer chain with intra and inter-trimer antiferromagnetic exchange couplings, ($J >0$ and $J' >0$), respectively, unveiling various quasi-particles: magnons, singletons, triplons, pentons, and heptons. For weak inter-trimer exchange coupling $J'/J \ll 1$, it behaves as an effective spin-$1$ chain with valence bond solid (VBS) ground state. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we compute the dynamic structure factor (DSF) which reveals a gapped magnon band alongside weakly dispersive singleton, excited triplon, and penton excitations. The evolution of these excitations with inter-trimer coupling $J'$ is also examined, providing insight into the underlying excitation mechanisms. For spin-$1$ chain, these exotic quasi-particles eventually reduce to conventional magnon excitations as $J'/J \rightarrow 1$. Our results shed light on the rich and complex excitation spectrum of spin-$1$ trimer chains and offer unique perspectives on the dynamics in quantum spin systems.</p>

We repeatedly cool superconducting strips with different width in an applied magnetic field and image the individual vortices. From these images we determine the threshold field at which the first vortex enters a strip, as well as the number and spatial configuration of vortices beyond this threshold field. We model vortex behavior with and without considering the effect of pinning by numercially minimizing the Gibbs free energy of vortices in the strips. Our measurements provide a first benchmark to understand the flux trapping properties of NbTiN thin films directly relevant to NbTiN-based superconducting circuits and devices.</p>

            <h2>Contrasting exchange-field and spin-transfer torque driving mechanisms in all-electric electron spin resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Reina-Galvez, Matyas Nachtigall, Nicolas Lorente, Jan Martinek, Christoph Wolf</p>
            <p>Understanding the coherent properties of electron spins driven by electric fields is crucial for their potential application in quantum-coherent nanoscience. In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in electric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single orbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage modulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master equation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two distinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity, electron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven mechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold spin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity drives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum spin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin accumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin resonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which driving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing quantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Fabbri, Alessandro Giuliani, Robin Reuvers</p>
            <p>The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subrata Pachhal, Adhip Agarwala</p>
            <p>Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.</p>

            <p>Large-scale integration of semiconductor spin qubits into quantum processors hinges on the ability to characterize quantum components at scale, a task challenged by their operation at sub-kelvin temperatures, in the presence of magnetic fields, and by the use of radio-frequency signals.

The crossbar features tightly-pitched spin qubit tiles and is implemented in planar germanium, by fabricating a large device with the potential to host 1058 hole spin qubits. Measurements on a patch of 40 tiles demonstrate key device functionality at millikelvin temperatures, including tile addressability, threshold voltage and charge noise statistics, and the characterisation of hole spin qubits and their coherence times in a single tile. These demonstrations pave the way for a new generation of quantum devices designed for the statistical characterisation of spin qubits.</p>

            <p>In strong magnetic fields beyond 100 T, the significant Zeeman energy competes with the lattice interactions, where a considerable magnetostriction is expected. However, the microscopic observation of the magnetostriction above 100 T has been hindered due to the short pulse duration of $\mu$-seconds and the coil's destruction. Here, we report the observation of the giant and anisotropic magnetostriction of $\sim 1$ % at 110 T in the spin-controlled crystal, $\beta$-O$_{2}$, by combining the single-shot diffraction of x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) and the newly developed portable 100 T generator (PINK-02). The very soft and anisotropic response of $\beta$-O$_{2}$ should originate in the competing van der Waals force and exchange interaction, and also the frustration of spin and lattice on the triangular network. The XFEL experiment above 100 T using PINK-02 enables microscopic investigations on materials' properties at high magnetic fields, providing insights into how spins contribute to the stability of crystal structures.</p>

            <p>Manipulating the optical and quantum properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials through strain engineering is not only fundamentally interesting but also provides significant benefits across various applications. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on the magnetic and optical properties of the monolayer MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishik Perugu, Arijit Haldar, Sumilan Banerjee</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium dynamics of unentangled and entangled pure states in interacting quantum systems is crucial for harnessing quantum information and to understand quantum thermalization. We develop a general Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory for non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states of fermions. We apply our formalism to study the time evolution of initial density inhomogeneity and multi-point correlations of pure states in the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We demonstrate a remarkable universality in the dynamics of pure states in the SYK model. We show that dynamics of almost all pure states in a fixed particle number sector is solely determined by a set of universal large-$N$ Kadanoff-Baym equations. Moreover, irrespective of the initial state the site- and disorder-averaged Green's function thermalizes instantaneously, whereas local and non-local Green's functions have finite thermalization rate. We provide understanding of our numerical and analytical large-$N$ results through random-matrix theory (RMT) analysis. Furthermore, we show that the thermalization of an initial pure product state in the non-interacting SYK$_2$ model is independent of fermion filling and an initial density inhomogeneity decays with weak but long lived oscillations due to dephasing. In contrast, the interacting SYK$_{q\geq 4}$ model thermalizes slower than the non-interacting model and exhibits filling-dependent monotonic relaxation of initial inhomogeneity. For evolution of entangled pure states, we show that the initial entanglement is encoded in the non-local and/or multi-point quantum correlations that relax as the system thermalizes.</p>

            <p>Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) provides direct insights into microscopic magnetic interactions in crystalline materials, making it a valuable experimental technique in condensed matter physics and materials science. These interactions can be extracted by fitting spin wave dispersions to Heisenberg Hamiltonians using spin wave theory. However, such datasets are scattered across the literature and lack a standardized format, which limits their accessibility, reproducibility, and utility. In this work, we compile and standardize exchange interaction data obtained from INS experiments on nearly 100 magnetic materials. The resulting dataset includes exchange parameters expressed in a unified Heisenberg model format, visualizations of crystal structures with annotated exchange pathways, and Monte Carlo simulation files generated using the ESpinS code. We use these experimentally derived exchange interactions to compute magnetic transition temperatures ($T_c$) via classical Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the $(S+1)/S$ correction in the simulations and find it improves agreement with experimental $T_c$ values in most cases.

            <p>This work presents a fully physical model of the hydrogen diffusion and trapping kinetics in metals, integrating permeation and thermal desorption within a unified framework. Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it requires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly reproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical solutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal desorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has elucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters commonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An equation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the dependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of occupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the model represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and rationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint.</p>

            <p>Turbostratic multilayer graphene, composed of randomly twisted and stacked graphene sheets, offers a naturally disordered yet tunable platform for exploring moiré physics beyond tedious artificial stacking. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and Raman analysis, we uncover a wide distribution of twist angles and stacking configurations spontaneously formed across large-area turbostratic films. In several regions, we identify overlapping incommensurate moiré patterns consistent with locally chiral trilayer stacking. We observe van Hove singularities and reconstructed Dirac-like spectra whose angle dependence supports strong interlayer electronic coherence. In the highly strained trilayered regions, we observe peaks in the local density-of states with characteristic scaling of the quantized Landau levels strikingly even in the absence of a magnetic field. They arise from the strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields (~ 26 T), making turbostratic graphene a single natural platform to explore the physics of moiré structures as well as of the pseudo-electromagnetic fields.</p>

The real-space geometry can be used to tune into topological phases occupying an expanded phase space compared to crystals, or into a disorder-driven topological Anderson insulator. The quantum metric can also be tuned continuously, opening new routes towards tunable single- and many-body physics in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Pair binding and Hund's rule breaking in high-symmetry fullerenes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Rausch, C. Karrasch</p>
            <p>Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results support an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding.</p>

            <p>We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fröhlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. We describe also the time evolution during the process of relaxation to the thermal state and the time dependence of quantum von Neumann and classical Boltzmann entropies during this process. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity. System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</p>

We also discuss concrete setups that measure random times directly without continuous monitoring. Taken together, this paper discusses the relationship between temporal information and thermodynamics. This framework is relevant for external protocols employing random times, such as, stochastic resetting protocols and cyclically driven heat engines that use randomly timed protocols.</p>

            <p>Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) ferroelectrics are promising for next-generation non-volatile memory applications due to high remnant polarization compared with Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 and doped-HfO2 material systems, as well as their fast switching and scalability to nanometer thicknesses. As AlScN films are thinned to 10 nm thickness, coercive field has been shown to substantially increase, which hinders low voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase with scaling and improves ferroelectric performance. Here, we demonstrate robust ferroelectricity in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, the difference in dynamic switching behavior over a decade of frequency was evaluated by applying the KAI model. At frequencies lower than 16.7 kHz, the capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents of 0.030 and 0.028, indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent of 0.063, indicating a stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.030, suggesting a lower frequency dependence during faster switching scenarios. The Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction technique was selected to measure the strain difference in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, providing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain and switching behavior in ultra-thin film systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Shen, Honghu Zhang, Beate Klösgen, Benjamin M. Ocko</p>
            <p>The surface roughness of a thin film at a liquid interface exhibits contributions of thermally excited fluctuations. This thermal roughness depends on temperature (T), surface tension ($\gamma$) and elastic material properties, specifically the bending modulus ($\kappa$) of the film. A non-zero $\kappa$ suppresses the thermal roughness at small length scales compared to an interface with zero $\kappa$, as expressed by the power spectral density (PSD) of the thermal roughness. The description of the X-ray scattering of the standard Capillary Wave Model (CWM), that is valid for zero $\kappa$, is extended to include the effect of $\kappa$. The extended CWM (eCWM) provides a single analytical form for both the specular XRR and the diffuse scattering around the specular reflection, and recovers the expression of the CWM at its zero $\kappa$ limit. This new theoretical approach enables the use of single-shot grazing incidence X-ray off-specular scattering (GIXOS) measurements for characterizing the structure of thin films on a liquid surface. The eCWM analysis approach decouples the thermal roughness factor from the surface scattering signal, providing direct access to the intrinsic surface-normal structure of the film and its bending modulus. Moreover, the eCWM facilitates the calculation of reflectivity at any desired resolution (pseudo XRR approach). The transformation into pseudo XRR provides the benefit of using widely available XRR software to perform GIXOS analysis. The extended range of the vertical scattering vector (Qz) available with the GIXOS-pseudo XRR approach allows for a higher spatial resolution than with conventional XRR. Experimental results are presented for various lipid systems, showing strong agreement between conventional specular XRR and pseudo XRR methods. This agreement validates the proposed approach and highlights its utility for analyzing soft, thin films.</p>

            <p>The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peichen Zhong, Bowen Deng, Shashwat Anand, Tara Mishra, Gerbrand Ceder</p>
            <p>Mn-rich disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials exhibit a phase transformation from a disordered to a partially disordered spinel-like structure ($\delta$-phase) during electrochemical cycling. In this computational study, we used charge-informed molecular dynamics with a fine-tuned CHGNet foundation potential to investigate the phase transformation in Li$_{x}$Mn$_{0.8}$Ti$_{0.1}$O$_{1.9}$F$_{0.1}$. Our results indicate that transition metal migration occurs and reorders to form the spinel-like ordering in an FCC anion framework. The transformed structure contains a higher concentration of non-transition metal (0-TM) face-sharing channels, which are known to improve Li transport kinetics. Analysis of the Mn valence distribution suggests that the appearance of tetrahedral Mn$^{2+}$ is a consequence of spinel-like ordering, rather than the trigger for cation migration as previously suggested. Calculated equilibrium intercalation voltage profiles demonstrate that the $\delta$-phase, unlike the ordered spinel, exhibits solid-solution signatures at low voltage. A higher Li capacity is obtained than in the DRX phase. This study provides atomic insights into solid-state phase transformation and its relation to experimental electrochemistry, highlighting the potential of machine learning interatomic potentials for understanding complex oxide materials.</p>

            <h2>Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the cuprate pseudogap: reconciling Fermi arcs and hole pockets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harshit Pandey, Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Ravi Shanker, Sayantan Sharma, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>The cuprate pseudogap phase displays Fermi arc spectral weight in photoemission, while recent magnetotransport observations yield evidence for the existence of hole pockets of fractional area $p/8$, where $p$ is the doping density. We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We predict that quantum oscillations of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates in regimes with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fleur Hendriks, Vlado Menkovski, Martin Doškář, Marc G.D. Geers, Kevin Verbeek, Ondřej Rokoš</p>
            <p>Mechanical metamaterials often exhibit pattern transformations through instabilities, enabling applications in, e.g., soft robotics, sound reduction, and biomedicine. These transformations and their resulting mechanical properties are closely tied to the symmetries in these metamaterials' microstructures, which remain under-explored. Designing such materials is challenging due to the unbounded design space, and while machine learning offers promising tools, they require extensive training data. Here, we present a large dataset of 2D microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical responses in the hyperelastic, finite-strain regime, including buckling. The microstructures are generated using a novel method, which covers all 17 wallpaper symmetry groups and employs Bézier curves for a rich parametric space. Mechanical responses are obtained through finite element-based computational homogenization. The dataset includes 1,020 distinct geometries, each subjected to 12 loading trajectories, totaling 12,240 trajectories. Our dataset supports the development and benchmarking of surrogate models, facilitates the study of symmetry-property relationships, and enables investigations into symmetry-breaking during pattern transformations, potentially revealing emergent behavior in mechanical metamaterials.</p>

            <h2>Walking on Archimedean Lattices: Insights from Bloch Band Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davidson Noby Joseph, Igor Boettcher</p>
            <p>Returning walks on a lattice are sequences of moves that start at a given lattice site and return to the same site after $n$ steps. Determining the total number of returning walks of a given length $n$ is a typical graph-theoretical problem with connections to lattice models in statistical and condensed matter physics. We derive analytical expressions for the returning walk numbers on the eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices by developing a connection to the theory of Bloch energy bands. We benchmark our results through an alternative method that relies on computing the moments of adjacency matrices of large graphs, whose construction we explain explicitly. As condensed matter physics applications, we use our formulas to compute the density of states of tight-binding models on the Archimedean lattices and analytically determine the asymptotics of the return probability. While the Archimedean lattices provide a sufficiently rich structure and are chosen here for concreteness, our techniques can be generalized straightforwardly to other two- or higher-dimensional Euclidean lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Navketan Batra, Zezhu Wei, Smitha Vishveshwara, D. E. Feldman</p>
            <p>Anyonic interferometry is a direct probe of fractional statistics. We propose an interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry schemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped topological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-Pérot interferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the interference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic statistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of bulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for the electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling strength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is similar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge and statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain states and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias.</p>

            <h2>Exact results for active particle models: from long-range interactions to first-passage properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Léo Touzo</p>
            <p>The goal of this thesis is to obtain new exact results for models of active particles in one dimension, focusing on two different aspects: their behavior in the presence of long-range interactions and their first-passage properties. In the first part we give an overview of existing exact results both for active particle models and for Brownian particles with long-range interactions (Riesz gases). The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be combined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with long-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the stationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large, using an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles (RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we obtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of confining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium phase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb interaction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more difficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the tagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and analyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle positions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for its active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both at short times and at small distances. The last part of this thesis focuses on Siegmund duality, which connects the first-passage properties of a stochastic process with absorbing boundaries to its spatial distribution with hard walls. We extend this duality to a new class of stochastic processes, which includes active particles and diffusing diffusivity models.</p>

            <p>CeRhSn is a valence fluctuating heavy-fermion metal with a twisted Ce-kagome lattice, displaying zero-field quantum criticality, previously associated with geometrical frustration. The partial substitution of Rh by Pd in CeRh$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$Sn enlarges the unit-cell volume, suppresses valence fluctuations, decreases the Kondo temperature and stabilizes a possible long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered ground state with $T_N=0.8$ K at $x=0.5$. Previous thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements for $x=0.1$ suggested a quantum critical spin liquid. We report low-temperature dilatometry and magnetization measurements on CeRh$_{0.9}$Pd$_{0.1}$Sn and compare with published low-$T$ specific heat data. The absence of a Grüneisen parameter divergence excludes a conventional quantum criticality scenario. Instead, the weak power-law divergences signal non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior, according to a disorder-driven quantum Griffiths phase scenario. At low temperatures, a negative thermal expansion is found in fields above approximately 0.5 T and the NFL scaling breaks down, probably due to the polarization of AFM correlations.</p>

            <h2>calcQPI: A versatile tool to simulate quasiparticle interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Wahl, Luke C. Rhodes, Carolina A. Marques</p>
            <p>Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While the design of kirigami metamaterials has been widely studied, the simulation of the deployment and shape transformation process is less explored.

In particular, our tool is capable of simulating both two- and three-dimensional deployments of a large variety of kirigami metamaterials with different geometric, topological, and physical properties. The tool is also highly interactive and customizable, allowing the user to perform deployment simulations of kirigami structures under different environmental setups and material properties.

By combining double-pulse excitation and time-resolved second harmonic generation techniques under high-density electronic excitation in a 2D layered material, WTe$_{2}$, we demonstrate that the lattice symmetry switching from the Weyl semimetallic T$_{d}$ to the semimetallic 1T$^{\prime}$ phases is independent of the amplitude of the coherent interlayer shear phonons after the arrival of the second pump pulse. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms for symmetry switching that electronic excitation-driven shear sliding plays a dominant role.</p>

            <h2>Extensive entanglement between coupled Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids in and out of equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taufiq Murtadho, Marek Gluza, Nelly H. Y. Ng</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement exists in nature but is absent in classical physics, hence it fundamentally distinguishes quantum from classical theories. While entanglement is routinely observed for few-body systems, it is significantly more challenging to witness in quantum many-body systems. Here, we theoretically study entanglement between two parallel and spatially separated Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) partitioned along the longitudinal axis. In particular, we focus on 1D Bose gases as a realization of TLLs and investigate two experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled gases at finite temperatures and after coherent splitting. In both scenarios, we analytically calculate the logarithmic negativity and identify a threshold temperature below which the system is entangled. Notably, this threshold temperature is accessible in near-term coherent splitting experiments. Furthermore, we investigate the crossover between quantum and classical correlations in the vicinity of the threshold temperature by comparing logarithmic negativity with mutual information. We argue that the initial mutual information established by the coherent splitting is conserved in TLL dynamics, thus preventing certain generalized Gibbs ensembles from being reached during prethermalization. Moreover, both logarithmic negativity and mutual information are found to scale extensively with the subsystem's length. Although the ground-state entanglement between coupled TLLs has been predicted to be extensive, this setting is largely overlooked compared to other partitions. Our work extends the study of entanglement between coupled TLLs to finite temperatures and out-of-equilibrium regimes, and provides a strategy towards experimental detection of extensive entanglement in quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures.</p>

            <h2>A Replica Stoner Theory for Dirty Ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenzhe Deng, Tai Kai Ng</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the effect of disorder on a ferromagnetic metal with repulsive interactions. We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed.</p>

            <p>Topological frustration arises when boundary conditions impose geometric frustration in a quantum system, creating delocalized defects in the ground states and profoundly altering the low-energy properties. While previous studies have been concerned with one-dimensional systems, showing that the ground state structure can be described in terms of quasiparticle excitations, the two-dimensional setting remains unexplored. We address this gap by studying a three-legged antiferromagnetic quantum Ising ladder on a torus using tensor network methods, where topological frustration is induced by an odd number of spins along both spatial directions. Our results reveal the first instance in which topological frustration shifts the position of the quantum critical point. By studying the entanglement structure, we find that the ground state can be characterized as hosting three delocalized quasiparticles. This work builds the quasiparticle picture of topological frustration toward higher dimensions and more complex systems than those considered so far.</p>

Here, we develop a quantum theory of exciton orbital magnetic moment that reveals several conceptually new terms absent in prior theories, including an unforeseen contribution from exciton band quantum geometry. Our ab initio calculations yield results in excellent agreement with measurements, establishing the importance of a full theory including interaction and topological effects for the magnetic response of excitons.</p>

            <p>We study the classical dipole-octupole pyrochlore spin systems in an external magnetic field along the $[111]$ direction. We identify an intermediate fragmented spin liquid phase that precedes full spin saturation, characterized by the coexistence of three phenomena: U(1) spin liquid on the Kagome planes, spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking, and partial spin polarization from explicit symmetry breaking. We show that even without dipolar interactions, the dipolar components can form a spin liquid driven by the octupolar spin liquid. The physics manifests itself experimentally as shadow pinch points: low-intensity pinch points underlying the strong Bragg peaks. We discuss how these discoveries are directly relevant to various experiments on dipole-octupole pyrochlore materials, including neutron scattering, magnetization, and magnetostriction.</p>

Two types of two-magnon bound states (BSs), i.e., the NN and NNN exchange BSs, are revealed. We establish a phase diagram in the $J_1/(|J_2|\Delta_2)$-$\Delta_1$ plane where regions supporting different types of BSs are analytically identified. It is found that no BSs exist (the two types of BSs coexist) when both $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ are small (large) enough. Our results for the isotropic case $\Delta_1=\Delta_2=1$ are consistent with an early work [Ono I, Mikado S and Oguchi T 1971 \emph{J. Phys. Soc. Japan} \textbf{30} 358].</p>

            <p>The machine learning based approaches efficiently solve the goal of searching the best materials candidate for the targeted properties. The search for topological materials using traditional first-principles and symmetry-based methods often requires lots of computing power or is limited by the crystalline symmetries. In this study, we present frequency-based statistical descriptors for machine learning-driven topological material's classification that is independent of crystallographic symmetry of wave functions. This approach predicts the topological nature of a material based on its chemical formula. With a balanced dataset of 3910 materials, we have achieved classification accuracies of 82\% with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and 83\% with the Random Forest (RF) model, where both models have trained on common frequency based features. We have verified the performances of the models using $5-fold$ cross-validation approach. Further, we have validated the models on a dataset of unseen binary compounds and have efficiently identified 22 common materials using both the models. Next, we implemented the $first-principles$ approach to confirm the topological nature of these predicted materials and found the topological signatures of Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the implications of frequency-based descriptors is a practical and less complex way to find novel topological materials with certain physical post-processing filters. This approach lays the groundwork for scalable, data-driven topological property screening of complex materials.</p>

We experimentally detect the multipartite entanglement of a two-dimensional cluster state involving 123 orbit qubits through direct stabilizer measurements, verifying the full bipartite non-separability. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-based quantum computation by implementing single-qubit and two-qubit logical gates, highlighting the flexibility of orbit-qubit operations.

            <p>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) using 2D nanomaterials has emerged as a sophisticated approach to mitigate industrial CO2 emissions. In this work, the potential application of pristine as well as strategically Fe, Co, Ni-doped 2D AlSb was examined as a CO2RR electrocatalyst. The recation pathways of CO2RR intermediate complexes, overpotential, stability, efficiency, and selectivity were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Outstanding overpotentials were achieved with pristine and doped 2D AlSb: Ni-doped 2D AlSb was selective for HCOOH (0.12eV) and CH4 (0.28eV), and Fe-doped 2D AlSb for HCHO (0.31eV) and CH3OH (0.31eV). The opposing effects of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was mitigated with the application of electric potential and solution pH. The main reasons for the enhancement of catalytic effect due to doping with Fe, Co, and Ni are bandgap reduction and creation of states at the edge of the valence band due to the 3d orbitals of these dopants. Interestingly, the Fe-doped 2D AlSb catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity. Excellent electrocatalytic properties of pristine and doped 2D AlSb make them suitable as CO2RR catalysts contributing towards a green and sustainable energy ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>Improving the efficiency of finite-time memory erasure with potential barrier shaping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vipul Rai, Moupriya Das</p>
            <p>Erasure of the binary memory, 0 or 1, is an essential step for digital computation as it involves irreversible logic operations. In the classical case, the erasure of a bit of memory is accompanied by the evolution of a minimum amount of heat set by the Landauer bound kTln2, which can be achieved in the asymptotic limit. However, the erasure of memory needs to be completed within a finite time for practical and effective computational processes. It is observed that the higher the speed of erasure, the greater the amount of heat released, which leads to unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, this is a fundamental challenge to reduce the evolved heat related to finite-time memory erasure. In the present work, we address this crucial aspect in the field of information thermodynamics, where the two memory states correspond to the two wells of a bistable potential, as in the conventional cases. However, the potential is asymmetric in terms of the width of the two wells. Moreover, the two memory states are separated by a barrier that is asymmetric in structure. We examine in detail the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the success rate of the erasure process and the work done or heat released associated with it. We find that the asymmetry in the potential barrier partitioning the two memory states plays a very significant role in improving the efficiency of the erasure process, in view of the success rate and the thermodynamic costs. We retrieve the approach towards the Landauer limit in terms of the energetics involved with the erasure mechanism under the symmetric setup.</p>

We focus on two-dimensional magnetic films sustaining surface acoustic waves, a geometry where our model successfully reproduces our recent experimental observation of phonon-to-magnon down-conversion under acoustic drive. We provide analytical expressions for all the rates in our equations, which make them particularly suitable for quantization. We then quantize our model, deriving Heisenberg-Langevin equations of motion for magnon and phonon operators, and show how to compute quantum expectation values in the mean field approximation.

            <p>Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) are a type of quantum sensor known for its high single-photon detection efficiency and low background. This makes them ideal for particle physics experiments searching for rare events. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of the background in optical TESs, distinguishing three types of events: electrical-noise, high-energy, and photonlike events. We introduce computational methods to automate the classification of events. For the first time, we experimentally verify and simulate the source of the high-energy events. We also isolate the photonlike events, the expected signal in dielectric haloscopes searching for dark matter dark photons, and achieve a record-low photonlike dark-count rate of $3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz in the 0.8-3.2 eV energy range.</p>

            <h2>$\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK models with dynamical bosons and fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Benini, Tomas Reis, Saman Soltani, Ziruo Zhang</p>
            <p>We study a class of SYK models with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, described by $N$ fermions in chiral Fermi multiplets, as well as $\alpha N$ first-order bosons in chiral multiplets. The interactions are characterized by two integers $(p,q)$. We focus on the large $N$ and low energy limit of these models. Despite the presence of dynamical bosons, we find conformal behavior akin to the standard SYK model. We use $\mathcal{I}$-extremization of a Witten index to study the supersymmetric solutions. In particular, we find an exact expression for the entropy, which matches the numerical solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations. We further solve the model both in the large $p$ and large $p,q$ limits. Numerically, we verify our analytical results and obtain estimates for the Schwarzian coupling in the near zero-temperature limit. We also study the low-lying spectrum of operators to determine the parameter ranges where the Schwarzian mode dominates the IR dynamics. Lastly, we study out-of-time-ordered correlators to show that the model is maximally chaotic.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Computer-Based Verification of Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nobumasa Ishida, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations establish fundamental trade-offs between the precision achievable in quantum systems and associated thermodynamic quantities such as entropy production or dynamical activity. While foundational, empirical demonstrations have thus far been confined to specific cases, either assuming time-reversal symmetry or involving particular measurement types, leaving the verification of their universal validity unrealized. This work leverages a quantum computer to report the first empirical verification of a general quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation, valid for arbitrary dynamics and observables. We theoretically derive the relation, revealing survival activity as the pivotal thermodynamic quantity governing the precision bound. The verification is demonstrated on IBM's cloud-based quantum processor, which is treated as a real thermodynamic system. To achieve accurate results despite substantial device errors, we introduce a generic protocol for measuring survival activity and employ circuit reduction techniques based on the relation's properties. This strategy allows us to empirically identify survival activity for the first time and confirm the derived relation. Furthermore, the quantum computer's versatility enables the implementation of optimal observables, leading to the saturation of the relation and demonstrating the sharpness of our bound on a physical device. The method's broad applicability is further illustrated by verifying the trade-off for quantum time correlators. Our findings establish quantum computers as effective platforms for investigating fundamental thermodynamic trade-off relations.</p>

            <h2>Detecting quantum chaos via pseudo-entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Song He, Pak Hang Chris Lau, Long Zhao</p>
            <p>Quantum informatic quantities such as entanglement entropy are useful in detecting quantum phase transitions. Recently, a new entanglement measure called pseudo-entropy was proposed which is a generalization of the more well-known entanglement entropy. It has many nice properties and is useful in the study of post-selection measurements. In this paper, one of our goals is to explore the properties of pseudo-entropy and study its effectiveness as a quantum chaos diagnostic, i.e., as a tool to distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. Using various variants of the SYK model, we study the signal of quantum chaos captured in the pseudo-entropy and relate it to the spectral form factor (SFF) and local operator entanglement (LOE).</p>

            <h2>Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii</p>
            <p>The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinan Chen, Andreas Elben, Angel Rubio, Gil Refael</p>
            <p>Quantum-enhanced sensors, which surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL) and approach the fundamental precision limits dictated by quantum mechanics, are finding applications across a wide range of scientific fields. This quantum advantage becomes particularly significant when a large number of particles are included in the sensing circuit. Achieving such enhancement requires introducing and preserving entanglement among many particles, posing significant experimental challenges. In this work, we integrate concepts from Floquet theory and quantum information to design an entangler capable of generating the desired entanglement between two paths of a quantum interferometer. We demonstrate that our path-entangled states enable sensing beyond the SQL, reaching the fundamental Heisenberg limit (HL) of quantum mechanics. Moreover, we show that a decoding parity measurement maintains the HL when specific conditions from Floquet theory are satisfied$\unicode{x2013}$particularly those related to the periodic driving parameters that preserve entanglement during evolution. We address the effects of a priori phase uncertainty and imperfect transmission, showing that our method remains robust under realistic conditions. Finally, we propose a superconducting-circuit implementation of our sensor in the microwave regime, highlighting its potential for practical applications in high-precision measurements.</p>

            <p>Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit, which is capable of reaching strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes, as shown in previous studies. Here, we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with two cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude those in earlier experiments. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current mediated by photons by applying magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, our experiment opens new possibilities for quantum thermodynamics, aiming to realize true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, by leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and its environment in future experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artur M. Lacerda, Laetitia P. Bettmann, John Goold</p>
            <p>In a transition between nonequilibrium steady states, the entropic cost associated with the maintenance of steady-state currents can be distinguished from that arising from the transition itself through the concepts of excess/housekeeping entropy flux and adiabatic/nonadiabatic entropy production. The thermodynamics of this transition is embodied by the Hatano-Sasa relation. In this letter, we show that for a slow transition between quantum nonequilibrium steady states the nonadiabatic entropy production is, to leading order, given by the path action with respect to a Riemannian metric in the parameter space which can be connected to the Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov quantum Fisher information. We then demonstrate how to obtain minimally dissipative paths by solving the associated geodesic equation and illustrate the procedure with a simple example of a three-level maser. Furthermore, by identifying the quantum Fisher information with respect to time as a metric in state space, we derive an upper bound on the excess entropy flux that holds for arbitrarily fast processes.</p>

            <h2>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Vikram</p>
            <p>Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, by coarse-graining over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all states (in any orthonormal basis) over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single mixed state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</p>

            <h2>Charging dynamics of electric double layer capacitors including beyond-mean-field electrostatic correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Fertig, Mathijs Janssen</p>
            <p>Electric double layer (EDL) formation underlies the functioning of supercapacitors and several other electrochemical technologies. Here, we study how the EDL formation near two flat blocking electrodes separated by $2L$ is affected by beyond-mean-field Coulombic interactions, which can be substantial for electrolytes of high salt concentration or with multivalent ions. Our model combines the Nernst-Planck and Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev (BSK) equations; the latter is a modified Poisson equation with a correlation length $\ell_c$. In response to a voltage step, the system charges exponentially with a characteristic timescale $\tau$ that depends nonmonotonically on $\ell_c$. For small $\ell_c$, $\tau$ is given by the BSK capacitance times a dilute electrolyte's resistance, in line with [Zhao, Phys. Rev. E 84, 051504 (2011)]; here, $\tau$ decreases with increasing $\ell_c$. Increasing the correlation length beyond $\ell_c\approx L^{2/3}\lambda_D^{1/3}$, with $\lambda_D$ the Debye length, $\tau$ reaches a minimum, rises as $\tau\propto \lambda_D\ell_c/D$, and plateaus at $\tau=4L^2/(\pi^2 D)$. Our results imply that strongly correlated, strongly confined electrolytes - ionic liquids in the surface force balance apparatus, say - move slower than predicted so far.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe</p>
            <p>We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</p>

            <p>The Fe-Ni alloy is believed to be the main component of Earth's core. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of phase equilibria near the melting point of this alloy under core conditions is still lacking, leaving the effect of nickel inconclusive. Using ab initio simulations, we computed Gibbs free energy and phase diagram for liquid and solid solutions of the Fe-Ni alloy under conditions close to the inner core, considering inner-shell electron contributions and non-ideal mixing effects. The Fe-Ni phase diagram provides crucial insights for understanding previous experimental observations and crystallization simulations of the Fe-Ni alloy under core conditions. It also presents new scenarios for inner core structures, suggesting bcc-liquid coexistence at the inner core boundary and the possibility of multi-layer structures consisting of bcc-hcp composites within the inner core. Our work clarifies nickel's substantial impact on the inner core structure, providing new constraints for the study of core's composition and formation.</p>

            <p>We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. By combining perturbative quantum field theory, semiclassical large $N$, and Bethe ansatz techniques, we show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions, respectively. Above a certain threshold value for $h$, $a$-fermion bound states condense and form an inhomogeneous configuration, which at infinite $N$ is a crystal spontaneously breaking translations. At large $h$, this crystal has mean $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and spatial oscillations of amplitude $2\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons and predicting new ones.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Jansen, Samiah Hassan, Ruoyao Wang</p>
            <p>Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses. While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims, while operationalizing feasibility assessment as a temporally-filtered claim verification task using backtesting. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task (chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making near-term progress.</p>

            <p>We describe a novel type of interaction between open-shell polar molecules at sub-millikelvin temperatures. This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.</p>

We also argue that, under particle/vortex duality, the Halon impurity is exchanged with the $\pi$-flux vortex line leading to spin-flux duality, a proposal which we test with a detailed matching of symmetries, anomalies, and phases. Finally, we write down quantum lattice Hamiltonians which can be used to test our predictions, and give an argument on the lattice in favor of spin-flux duality.</p>

            <p>In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</p>

This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error. Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions and Many-Body Backflow in Open Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Zhang, Chang Shu, Kai Sun</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are non-equilibrium transitions characterized by the orthogonality between an initial quantum state and its time-evolved counterpart following a sudden quench. Recently, studies of this phenomenon have been extended beyond closed quantum systems to include environmental interactions, often modeled through non-Hermitian effects. However, because non-Hermitian descriptions neglect both quantum jump processes and interaction effects, the ultimate fate of interacting quantum systems under full open-system quantum dynamics remains an open question. In this paper, by incorporating both interactions and full Liouvillian dynamics, we prove that DQPTs in open quantum systems remain robust when subject to either particle loss or particle gain alone, but are generically smeared out when both processes coexist, as a result of many-body particle backflow. Furthermore, we uncover a non-perturbative dynamical effect: even a weak admixture of gain (loss) into a system with loss (gain) can dramatically reshape the long-time behavior of DQPT dynamics, leading to substantial deviations over time. These phenomena--including the universal smearing of DQPTs and the emergence of large dynamical deviations in the long-time limit--arise intrinsically from non-equilibrium many-body effects in open quantum systems. Our findings are general and substantiated by both analytical arguments and numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>Spin ensembles are central to quantum science, from frequency standards and fundamental physics searches to magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantum sensing. Their performance is ultimately constrained by spin projection noise, yet solid-state implementations have so far been limited by much larger photon shot noise. Here we demonstrate a direct, quantum non-demolition readout of a mesoscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that surpasses the photon shot-noise limit and approaches the intrinsic spin projection noise. By stabilizing the $^{14}$N nuclear spin bath at high magnetic fields and employing repetitive nuclear-assisted spin readout, we achieve a noise reduction of 3.8 dB below the thermal projection noise level. This enables direct access to the intrinsic fluctuations of the spin ensemble, allowing us to directly observe the signatures of correlated spin states. Our results establish projection noise-limited readout as a practical tool for solid-state quantum sensors, opening pathways to quantum-enhanced metrology, direct detection of many-body correlations, and the implementation of spin squeezing in mesoscopic solid-state ensembles.</p>

            <p>Open quantum systems can be approximately described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) and Lindbladians. The two approaches differ by quantum jump terms corresponding to a measurement of the system by its environment. We analyze the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in NHHs and Lindbladians. In particular, we show how EPs in NHHs relate to a novel type of EPs -- multi-block EPs -- in the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, i.e. the Lindbladian in absence of quantum jump terms. We further analyze how quantum jump terms modify the multi-block structure. To illustrate our general findings, we present two prime examples: qubits and qutrits coupled to additional ground state levels that serve as sinks of the population. In those examples, we can navigate through the EP block structure by a variation of physical parameters. We analyze how the dynamics of the population of the states is affected by the order of the EPs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum geometric tensor serves as a sensitive indicator of EPs of different kinds.</p>

            <p>Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful variational ansätze capable of representing highly entangled quantum many-body wavefunctions. While the average entanglement properties of ensembles of restricted Boltzmann machines are well understood, the entanglement structure of autoregressive NQS such as recurrent neural networks and transformers remains largely unexplored. We perform large-scale simulations of ensembles of random autoregressive wavefunctions for chains of up to $256$ spins and uncover signatures of transitions in their average entanglement scaling, entanglement spectra, and correlation functions. We show that the standard softmax normalization of the wavefunction suppresses entanglement and fluctuations, and introduce a square modulus normalization function that restores them. Finally, we connect the insights gained from our entanglement and activation function analysis to initialization strategies for finding the ground states of strongly correlated Hamiltonians via variational Monte Carlo.</p>

            <h2>Krylov complexity and Wightman power spectrum with positive chemical potentials in Schrödinger field theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng-Zhang He, Lei-Hua Liu, Hai-Qing Zhang, Qing-Quan Jiang</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate the Krylov complexity of fermionic fields in Schrödinger field theory as the chemical potential is positive, validated by the engineered Wightman power spectra. For non-positive chemical potentials, the Lanczos coefficients exhibit linear behaviors with respect to $n$. However, as the chemical potential becomes positive, a dynamical transition occurs -- Lanczos coefficient $b_{n}$ develops a two-stage linear growth profile, transitioning from an initial slope of $\pi/\beta$ to the asymptotic slope of $2/\beta$; while Lanczos coefficient $a_{n}$ shows a deflection from near-zero values to linear descent with slope $-4/\beta$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature. Moreover, the engineered power spectra are used to study the evolution of the Krylov complexity and some universal behaviors are uncovered -- the single-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum results in the quadratic growth of the complexity, consistent with that from the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebraic construction. Conversely, the double-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum restores the exponential growth of the complexity, satisfying the maximal chaos bound. These results may provide new insights into the profound impact of chemical potential on the operator growth and Krylov complexity in the quantum field theory.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic-Field and Temperature Limits of a Kinetic-Inductance Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas M. Janssen, Farzad Faramarzi, Henry G. LeDuc, Sahil Patel, Gianluigi Catelani, Peter K. Day, Yoichi Ando, Christian Dickel</p>
            <p>Kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) offer broadband near-quantum-limited amplification with high saturation power. Due to the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials, KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground plane) while $\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the search for axion dark matter.</p>

            <h2>Mixed Quantum-Classical Approaches to Spin Current and Polarization Dynamics in Chiral Molecular Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Wang, Ruihao Bi, Wei Liu, Jiayue Han, Wenjie Dou</p>
            <p>Chiral molecular junctions offer a promising platform for realizing chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where spin filtering occurs without external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate spin transport in such junctions by combining quantum master equation (QME) methods for purely electronic dynamics with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to incorporate electron-phonon coupling. Our results show that transient spin polarization arises but ultimately decays to zero at long times. We find that bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strongly influence the spin current dynamics: higher bias enhances spin current but reduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient polarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage characteristics, enhancing spin currents at intermediate bias but suppressing them at high bias, while leaving the polarization dynamics largely unchanged. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational effects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Controlled Polarization Switch in a Polariton Josephson Junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeria A. Maslova, Nina S. Voronova</p>
            <p>The interaction between a particle's spin and momentum -- known as spin-orbit (SO) coupling -- is the cornerstone of modern spintronics. In Bose-Einsten condensates of ultracold atoms, SO coupling can be implemented and precisely controlled experimentally; photonic systems, on the other hand, possess an intrinsic SO interaction due to the longitudinal-transverse splitting of the photon modes. In this work, we focus on such spinor, SO-coupled exciton-polariton condensates on a ring, where the strength of the synthetic magnetic field is controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the structure. Inspired by recent experiments, we investigate the dynamics of a weakly-nonlinear four-mode bosonic Josephson junction within this geometry. We discover a narrow parameter range in which the interplay of the tunneling dynamics with polariton-specific SO coupling leads to a new regime, with dynamical switching of the fluid's circular polarization degree to the opposite, along the entire ring or on just one of its halves. Our results demonstrate polariton condensates in ring configurations as excellent candidates for all-optical controllable spin-switch applications, with prospects for scalability and observing non-trivial polarization patterns.</p>

            <h2>Laughlin charge pumping from interplay of chiral Dirac and chiral Majorana modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhan Cao, Yang Feng, Zhi-Hai Liu, Ke He</p>
            <p>Laughlin charge pumping has provided critical insights into the topological classification of individual materials, but remains largely unexplored in topological junctions. We explore Laughlin charge pumping in junctions composed of a chiral topological superconductor sandwiched between two quantum anomalous Hall insulators, driven by an adiabatically varying magnetic flux. Here, charge pumping can be mediated merely by chiral Dirac modes or by the interplay of chiral Dirac and chiral Majorana modes (CMMs). In the former case, a variation of one magnetic flux quantum induces the pumping of a unit charge, as the chiral Dirac mode accumulates the full flux-induced phase. In contrast, in the latter case, pumping a unit charge requires a variation of fractional magnetic flux quanta, determined by the device geometry and the parity of the number of enclosed superconducting vortices. This unique feature results from the charge-neutral and zero-momentum nature of zero-energy CMMs. Our work offers an experimentally viable pathway toward detecting CMMs and could also inspire further research into Laughlin charge or spin pumping in diverse topological junctions, which are now within experimental reach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yow-Ming Robin Hu, Elena A. Ostrovskaya, Alexander Yakimenko, Eliezer Estrecho</p>
            <p>Topological defects are central to modern physics, from spintronics to photonics, due to their robustness and potential application in information processing. In this work, we discuss topological point defects that spontaneously emerge at the imaginary Fermi arcs (degeneracy lines) in momentum space of two-dimensional systems described by non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians. In particular, we consider a generic non-Hermitian Dirac model and a phenomenological model describing hybrid light-matter quasiparticles - exciton polaritons hosted in an optical microcavity. In both cases, the eigenenergies of the system have both real and imaginary parts and form two distinct bands corresponding to two (pseudo-)spin states. We describe the trajectories of the point defects characterized by integer-valued topological winding (vorticity) analytically and show that the defects with opposite vorticity annihilate with each other in the fully gapped phases, but are protected from annihilation by the non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies (exceptional and hybrid points) in the gapless phases. We also suggest that the signatures of these defects can be experimentally measured in an exciton-polariton system.</p>

            <p>We report a violation of the spin-paramagnetic limit in the in-plane upper critical field ($B_{C2}^{\parallel}$) in Bi(10 nm)/Ni(1 nm) bilayers grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Superconductivity emerges at the interface through the formation of an ultrathin NiBi$_3$ layer, which hosts a remarkably robust superconducting state under in-plane magnetic fields. To account for the $B_{C2}^{\parallel}$ enhancement, we evaluate two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity models incorporating spin-orbit scattering and Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. However, none of these mechanisms fully capture the observed behavior. We discuss the potential role of unconventional pairing, possibly linked to spin fluctuations. Our findings suggest that, in the 2D limit, NiBi$_3$ may support a superconducting state beyond the standard spin-singlet framework.</p>

            <p>We propose that X-ray absorption and emission magnetic circular dichroism (XAS-MCD and XES-MCD) are promising measurements to directly detect ferroic higher-rank multipoles as candidate order parameters in altermagnets. Using the sum rules for XES-MCD and connecting them to multipole language, we demonstrate that the expectation value of the magnetic octupole moment is finite in the $d$-wave altermagnetic candidate rutile-type compounds TF$_2$ (T=transition metal). We also perform spectral calculations of XAS-MCD and XES-MCD based on an effective model with a full multiplet approach. While the intensity of the XAS-MCD spectra vanishes, the XES-MCD spectra exhibit finite intensity, whose spectrum becomes opposite by inverting the Nèel vector. These results clearly indicate ferroic magnetic octupole order in these compounds.</p>

            <p>Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Sufyan, Brahim Marfoua, J. Andreas Larsson, Erik van Loon, Rickard Armiento</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism represents a recently established class of collinear magnetism that combines zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin polarization, enabled by symmetry constraints rather than spin-orbit coupling. This distinctive behavior gives rise to sizable spin splitting even in materials composed of light, earth-abundant elements, offering promising prospects for next-generation spintronics applications. Despite growing theoretical and experimental interest, the discovery of altermagnetic materials remains limited due to the complexity of magnetic symmetry and the inefficiency of conventional approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive high-throughput screening of the entire MAGNDATA database, integrating symmetry analysis with spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify and characterize altermagnetic candidates. Our workflow uncovers 173 materials exhibiting significant spin splitting ($\geq 50$ meV within $\pm 3$ eV of the Fermi level), spanning both metallic and semiconducting systems. Crucially, our momentum-resolved analysis reveals that the spin splitting varies strongly across the Brillouin zone, and that the maximal splitting tends to occur away from the high-symmetry paths, a result that directly informs and guides future photoemission experiments. By expanding the catalog of known altermagnets and elucidating the symmetry-protected origins of spin splitting, this work lays a robust foundation for future experimental and theoretical advances in spintronics and quantum materials discovery.</p>

            <p>Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are currently being studied for potential applications in energy conversion. In this work, we used the Landauer approach to relate the various effects contributing to the thermoelectric efficiency of scandium nitride (ScN) to their microscopic origins.

Taking advantage of the results of our calculations, we propose a theoretical interpretation of recent experimental results revealing a strong dependence of the thermoelectric properties of ScN thin films on procedural variations during fabrication. The thermoelectric properties of ScN are decisively influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects or impurities. Our findings highlight the potential of this theoretical approach in studying thermoelectricity and uncovering future strategies to improve thermoelectric efficiency.</p>

            <p>The motion of microorganisms in their natural habitat is strongly influenced by their propulsion mechanisms, geometrical constraints, and random fluctuations. Here, we study numerically the first-passage-time (FPT) statistics of microswimmers, modeled as force-dipoles, to reach a no-slip wall. Our results demonstrate that hindered diffusion near the wall can increase the median FPT by orders of magnitude compared to "dry" agents, while the intricate interplay of active motion and hydrodynamic attraction speeds up the arrival at large Péclet numbers (measuring the importance of self-propulsion relative to diffusion). Strikingly, it leads to a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the dipole strength, where pushers reach the wall significantly faster than pullers. The latter become slower at an intermediate dipole strength and are more sensitive to their initial orientation, displaying a highly anisotropic behavior.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a microwave spin-photon interface based on a circular double quantum dot, inspired by recent experimental observations of anisotropic g-factors and ring states in InAs nanowires. We develop an effective theoretical model capturing the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic flux through the ring and show how ring states form at crossings of odd and even geometrical parity orbital states. Similar to bonding and antibonding states of conventional double quantum dots, the ring eigenstates can be changed into single dot states by detuning the dots, which enables a high degree of control over the system's properties. Applying a tilted magnetic field induces spin-charge hybridization which enables spin-photon coupling. For low disorder, the photons couple states of simultaneously (almost) opposite spin and angular momentum. With increasing disorder, the spin-photon coupling becomes analogous to the flopping mode mechanism of conventional double quantum dots where the spin is hybridized with the bonding and antibonding orbital states without angular momentum. We show that the system exhibits a second-order charge-noise sweet spot at a specific magnetic field angle, which lowers the system's sensitivity to dephasing while retaining a substantial spin-photon coupling strength. Moreover, the photon coupling mechanism can be switched off either electrically, by detuning to the single-dot regime, or magnetically, by rotating the field to disable the spin-charge hybridization.</p>

            <p>Bottom-up fabrication of inorganic nanostructures is emerging as an alternative to classical top-down approaches, offering precise nanometer-scale control at relatively low cost and effort. In particular, DNA nanostructures provide versatile scaffolds for directly templating the growth of metal structures. Previously, a DNA mold-based method for metal nanostructure synthesis has been established that supports a modular structure design and a high control over the structure formation. So far, this method was limited to the growth of gold and palladium nanostructures. Here, we report the successful adaptation of the DNA mold-based fabrication method to produce continuous silver nanowires. By optimizing reagent concentrations and applying gentle thermal annealing, we obtain continuous wire structures of several hundred nanometer length, overcoming limitations in anisotropic growth. Despite the strong interaction of silver ions with DNA, we can control the growth without increasing the complexity of our approach. Our structures are not oxidized yet they did not exhibit conductivity. This work demonstrates the versatility of DNA-templated metallization and opens new opportunities for constructing self-assembled hybrid nanostructures with controlled shape and composition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendrik Weiske, Rhyan Barrett, Ralf Tonner-Zech, Patrick Melix, Julia Westermayr</p>
            <p>The interpretation of experiments on reactive semiconductor surfaces requires statistically significant sampling of molecular dynamics, but conventional ab initio methods are limited due to prohibitive computational costs. Machine-learning interatomic potentials provide a promising solution, bridging the gap between the chemical accuracy of short ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and the extensive sampling required to simulate experiment. Using ethinyl-functionalized cyclooctyne adsorption on Si(001) as a model system, we demonstrate that conventional AIMD undersamples the configurational space, resulting in discrepancies with scanning tunnelling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data. To resolve these inconsistencies, we employ pre-trained equivariant message-passing neural networks, fine-tuned on only a few thousand AIMD snapshots, and integrate them into a "molecular-gun" workflow. This approach generates 10,000 independent trajectories more than 1,000 times faster than AIMD. These simulations recover rare intermediates, clarify the competition between adsorption motifs, and reproduce the experimentally dominant on-top [2+2] cycloaddition geometry. Our results show that fine-tuning of pre-trained foundational models enables statistically converged, chemically accurate simulations of bond-forming and bond-breaking events on complex surfaces, providing a scalable route to reconcile atomistic theory with experimental ensemble measurements in semiconductor functionalization.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive study of modulational instability (MI) in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling, confined to a deep optical lattice. The system is modeled by a set of discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equations.

Our analysis, conducted for both unstaggered and staggered fundamental modes, reveals markedly different instability landscapes for these two configurations. The analytical predictions are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations of the full nonlinear dynamics, which vividly illustrate the spatiotemporal evolution of wave amplitudes, phase coherence, and energy localization during the instability process. The numerical results, obtained via a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, show excellent agreement with the linear stability theory and provide a complete picture of the MI-induced pattern formation.</p>

Such system of equations has been recently derived for the quasiparticle densities in the two-band fermionic model with the particle-number conserving dissipative protocol. As standard FKPP equation the studied system of equations has one unstable and one stable homogeneous solution with travelling wave switching between them. We demonstrate that the conservation law enforces the synchronization of travelling waves for both densities and determine their minimal possible velocity. Surprisingly, we find the existence of jumps of the minimal velocity as function of control parameters. We obtain that the minimal velocity of the coupled FKPP equations may significantly exceed the minimal velocity for a single FKPP equation in a wide range of control parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manmeet Kaur, Somendra M. Bhattacharjee</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the fractal boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, and the sensitivity of DQPTs to changes in boundary conditions is examined. In particular, it is demonstrated how the topology of the spin chain influences the occurrence of DQPTs. Additionally, aqualitative argument based on quantum speed limits is provided to explain the suppression of DQPTs under certain boundary modifications.</p>

            <p>In recent years, sliding ferroelectricity has emerged as a topic of significant interest due to its possible application in non-volatile random access memory. This phenomenon is unique to two-dimensional van der Waals materials, where vertical ferroelectric polarization switching is induced by relative in-plane sliding of the constituent layers. The intrinsic stacking order influences the resulting polarization, creating distinct polarization regions separated by domain walls. These regions and the domain walls can be manipulated using an applied vertical electric field, enabling a switchable system that retains the environmental robustness of van der Waals materials under ambient conditions. This study investigates 3R-MoS$_2$ using various optical measurement techniques at room temperature. The spatially resolved optical measurements reveal apparent signal changes corresponding to different ferroelectric stacking orders and variations in layer count. Our findings demonstrate that fast optical mapping at room temperature is a reliable method for probing ferroelectric potential steps in 3R-stacked MoS$_2$ samples, thereby facilitating the identification of the ferroelectric configuration. This approach does not require a conductive substrate or an electrical contact to the sample, making it more versatile than traditional atomic force probe techniques.</p>

            <p>Discovering and engineering spin-polarised surface states in the electronic structures of condensed matter systems is a crucial first step in development of spintronic devices, wherein spin-polarised bands crossing the Fermi level can facilitate information transfer. Here, we show how the spin-orbit split K-point valleys of monolayer WSe$_2$ can be made potentially suitable for this purpose, despite the semiconducting ground state. By interfacing with metallic 2H-NbSe$_2$, these valence band extrema are shifted by $\sim$800~meV to produce a surface-localised Fermi surface populated only by spin-polarised carriers. By increasing the WSe$_2$ thickness, the Fermi pockets can be moved from K to $\Gamma$, demonstrating tunability of novel semi-metallic phases that exist atop a substrate additionally possessing charge density wave and superconducting transitions. Together, this study provides spectroscopic understanding into $p$-type, Schottky barrier-free interfaces, which are of urgent interest for bypassing the limitations of current-generation vertical field effect transistors, in addition to longer-term spintronics development.</p>

Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we reveal that laser induced ultrafast demagnetization dynamics in the g-wave AM CrSb are strongly governed by the laser incidence direction. Under normal incidence along the [0001] axis, two Cr sublattices exhibit symmetric temporal demagnetization but with different amplitudes, preserving the net-zero magnetization, unlike the behavior in d-wave AM. Off-normal incidence, however, induces pronounced asymmetric demagnetization between sublattices, transiently driving the system into a ferrimagnetic-like state with a sizable net magnetization. This direction-dependent response arises from the characteristic nodal structures in bulk g-wave AM electronic structure, which enable anisotropic optical intersite spin transfer (OISTR). By comparing g-wave and d-wave AMs, we propose that light-induced magnetization arises when laser polarization aligns with spin-uncompensated regions in electronic structures. This can be readily determined from the local spin density of states along specific band paths. Our results provide a fundamental understanding for laser-induced ultrafast dynamics in AM.</p>

            <h2>Mapping Microstructure: Manifold Construction for Accelerated Materials Exploration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon A. Mason, Megna N. Shah, Jeffrey P. Simmons, Dennis M. Dimiduk, Stephen R. Niezgoda</p>
            <p>Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2) invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors. This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated materials engineering context.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Inayoshi, Maksymilian Środa, Anna Kauch, Philipp Werner, Hiroshi Shinaoka</p>
            <p>We propose a causality-based divide-and-conquer algorithm for nonequilibrium Green's function calculations with quantics tensor trains. This algorithm enables stable and efficient extensions of the simulated time domain by exploiting the causality of Green's functions. We apply this approach within the framework of nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to the simulation of quench dynamics in symmetry-broken phases, where long-time simulations are often required to capture slow relaxation dynamics. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows to extend the simulated time domain without a significant increase in the cost of storing the Green's function.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamidreza Razavi, Nele Moelans</p>
            <p>This paper presents a physics-informed framework that integrates graph convolutional networks (GCN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to forecast microstructure evolution over long time horizons in both 2D and 3D with remarkable performance across varied metrics. The proposed framework is composition-aware, trained jointly on datasets with different compositions, and operates in latent graph space, which enables the model to capture compositions and morphological dynamics while remaining computationally efficient. Compressing and encoding phase-field simulation data with convolutional autoencoders and operating in Latent graph space facilitates efficient modeling of microstructural evolution across composition, dimensions, and long-term horizons. The framework captures the spatial and temporal patterns of evolving microstructures while enabling long-range forecasting at reduced computational cost after training.</p>

            <p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, within the virtual crystal alloy approximation, are performed, along with the development of a Landau-type model employing a symmetry-allowed analytical expression of the internal energy and having parameters being determined from first principles, to investigate properties and energetics of Al1-xScxN ferroelectric nitrides in their hexagonal forms. These DFT computations and this model predict the existence of two different types of minima, namely the 4-fold-coordinated wurtzite (WZ) polar structure and a 5-times paraelectric hexagonal phase (to be denoted as H5), for any Sc composition up to 40%. The H5 minimum progressively becomes the lowest energy state within hexagonal symmetry as the Sc concentration increases from 0 to 40%. Furthermore, the model points out to several key findings. Examples include the crucial role of the coupling between polarization and strains to create the WZ minimum, in addition to polar and elastic energies, and that the origin of the H5 state overcoming the WZ phase as the global minimum within hexagonal symmetry when increasing the Sc composition mostly lies in the compositional dependency of only two parameters, one linked to the polarization and another one being purely elastic in nature. Other examples are that forcing Al1-xScxN systems to have no or a weak change in lattice parameters when heating them allows to reproduce well their finite-temperature polar properties, and that a value of the axial ratio close to that of the ideal WZ structure does imply a large polarization at low temperatures but not necessarily at high temperatures because of the ordered-disordered character of the temperature-induced formation of the WZ state. Such findings should allow for a better fundamental understanding of (Al,Sc)N ferroelectric nitrides, which may be used to design efficient devices operating at low voltages.</p>

            <h2>Layer-Dependent Spin Properties of Charge Carriers in Vertically Coupled Telecom Quantum Dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Cizauskas, A. Kors, J. P. Reithmaier, A. M. Fox, M. Benyoucef, Manfred Bayer, Alex Greilich</p>
            <p>We investigate the spin properties of charge carriers in vertically coupled InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dots grown by molecular beam epitaxy, emitting at telecom C-band wavelengths, with a silicon $\delta$-doped layer. Using time-resolved pump-probe Faraday ellipticity measurements, we systematically study single-, two-, and four-layer quantum dot (QD) configurations to quantify how vertical coupling affects key spin-coherence parameters. Our measurements reveal distinct layer-dependent effects: (1) Adding a second QD layer flips the resident charge from electrons to holes, consistent with optically induced electron tunneling into lower-energy dots and resultant hole charging. (2) Starting from the four-layer sample, the pump-probe signal develops an additional non-oscillating, decaying component absent in single- and two-layer samples, attributed to multiple layer growth changing the strain environment, which reduces heavy-hole and light-hole mixing. (3) With four-layers or more, hole spin mode locking (SML) can be observed, enabling quantitative extraction of the hole coherence time $T_2 \approx 13$\,ns from SML amplitude saturation. We also extract longitudinal spin relaxation ($T_1$) and transverse ($T_2^*$) spin dephasing times, g-factors, and inhomogeneous dephasing parameters for both electrons and holes across all layer configurations. The hole spin dephasing times $T_2^*$ remain relatively constant (2.26-2.73\,ns) across layer counts, while longitudinal relaxation times $T_1$ decrease with increasing layers (from 1.03\,$\mu$s for single-layer to 0.31\,$\mu$s for four-layer samples). These findings provide potential design guidelines for engineering spin coherence in telecom-band QDs for quantum information applications.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate flux-flow instability (FFI) in a superconducting single-crystal titanium nitride (TiN) film with negligible volume pinning. By studying the critical current density in 12-nm thick TiN strips of varying widths, we accurately identify the experimental parameters at which the FFI regime occurs. A comprehensive analysis of critical velocity measurements allows us to determine the quasiparticle energy relaxation time, $\tau_E$. By comparing our results with the $\tau_E$ values obtained from other experimental methods, we gain insight into the dominant microscopic process that governs quasiparticle relaxation within the vortex core in TiN. This mechanism is driven by an increase in quasiparticle temperature relative to phonons, rather than by quasiparticles leaving the core. Our findings indicate that $\tau_E$ can be accurately determined through FFI measurements.</p>

            <h2>A pedestrian's approach to large deviations in semi-Markov processes with an application to entropy production</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander M. Maier, Jonas H. Fritz, Udo Seifert</p>
            <p>Semi-Markov processes play an important role in the effective description of partially accessible systems in stochastic thermodynamics. They occur, for instance, in coarse-graining procedures such as state lumping and when analyzing waiting times between few visible Markovian events. The finite-time measurement of any coarse-grained observable in a stochastic system depends on the specific realization of the underlying trajectory. Moreover, the fluctuations of such observables are encoded in their rate function that follows from the rate function of the empirical measure and the empirical flow in the respective process. Derivations of the rate function of empirical measure and empirical flow in semi-Markov processes with direction-time independence (DTI) exist in the mathematical literature, but have not received much attention in the stochastic thermodynamics community. We present an accessible derivation of the rate function of the tuple frequency in discrete-time Markov chains and extend this to the rate function of the empirical semi-Markov kernel in semi-Markov processes without DTI. From this, we derive an upper bound on the rate function of the empirical entropy production rate, which leads to a lower bound on the variance of the mean entropy production rate measured along a finite-time trajectory. We illustrate these analytical bounds with simulated data.</p>

            <p>We discover superconductivity in cubic W3Re2C with chiral structure and the superconducting transition temperature Tc is about 6.2 K. Detailed characterizations and analysis indicate that W3Re2C is a bulk type-II BCS superconductor with full isotropic gap. Moreover, first-principles calculations indicate that the electron-phonon coupling primarily arises from interactions between W/Re 5d electronic states and their low-frequency phonons. Furthermore, the breaking of inversion symmetry in W3Re2C facilitates the emergence of Weyl points in the electronic structure. Therefore, W3Re2C can serve as a promising platform for investigating the influences of chiral structure on both superconductivity and band topology.</p>

            <p>Magnetically controlled states in quantum materials are central to their unique electronic and magnetic properties. However, direct momentum-resolved visualization of these states via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has been hindered by the disruptive effect of magnetic fields on photoelectron trajectories. Here, we introduce an \textit{in-situ} method that is, in principle, capable of applying magnetic fields up to 1 T. This method uses substrates composed of nanomagnetic metamaterial arrays with alternating polarity. Such substrates can generate strong, homogeneous, and spatially confined fields applicable to samples with thicknesses up to the micron scale, enabling ARPES measurements under magnetic fields with minimal photoelectron trajectory distortion. We demonstrate this minimal distortion with ARPES data taken on monolayer graphene. Our method paves the way for probing magnetic field-dependent electronic structures and studying field-tunable quantum phases with state-of-the-art energy-momentum resolutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiman Al-Eryani</p>
            <p>The parquet equations present a cornerstone of some of the most important diagrammatic many-body approximations and methods currently on the market for strongly correlated materials: from non-local extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory to the functional renormalization group. The recently introduced single-boson exchange decomposition of the vertex presents an alternative set of equivalent equations in terms of screened interactions, Hedin vertices, and rest functions. This formulation has garnered much attention for several reasons: opening the door to new approximations, for avoiding vertex divergences associated with local moment formation plaguing the traditional parquet decomposition, and for its interpretative advantage in its built-in diagrammatic identification of bosons without resorting to Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. In this work, we show how the fermionic diagrams of the particle-particle and particle-hole polarizations can be mapped to diagrammatics of a bosonic self-energy of two respective bosonic theories with pure bosonic constituents, solidifying the identification of the screened interaction with a bosonic propagator. Resorting to a spin-diagonalized basis for the bosonic fields and neglecting the coupling between singlet and triplet components is shown to recover the trace log theory known from Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. Armed with this concrete mapping, we revisit a conjecture claiming that universal aspects of the parquet approximation coincide with those of the self-consistent screening approximation for a bosonic $O(N)$ model. We comment on the role of the self-energy and crossing symmetry in enforcing the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem in parquet-related approaches.</p>

            <h2>Zero Indirect Band Gap in Non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul S, Giandomenico Palumbo</p>
            <p>Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. We show that a zero indirect band gap can remain stable against non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the regimes where this robustness persists. Remarkably, we find that the zero indirect gap induces a suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect distinct from other physical mechanics already discussed in the literature. Our results reveal new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures provide a platform to engineer many-body interactions. Here, we realize a bichromatic moiré superlattice in an asymmetric WSe$_2$/WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterotrilayer by combining R- and H-stacked bilayers with mismatched moiré wavelengths. This structure hosts fermionic quadrupolar moiré trions--interlayer excitons bound to an opposite-layer hole--with vanishing dipole moments. These trions arise from hybridized moiré potentials enabling multiple excitonic orbitals with tunable interlayer coupling, allowing control of excitonic and electronic ground states. We show that an out-of-plane electric field could effectively reshape moiré excitons and interlayer-intralayer electron correlations, driving a transition from interlayer to intralayer Mott states with enhanced Coulomb repulsion. The asymmetric stacking further enriches excitonic selection rules, broadening opportunities for spin-photon engineering. Our results demonstrate bichromatic moiré superlattices as a reconfigurable platform for emergent quantum states, where quadrupolar moiré trion emission may enable coherent and entangled quantum light manipulation.</p>

            <p>The sharp increase in resistivity of copper interconnects at ultra-scaled dimensions threatens the continued miniaturization of integrated circuits. Topological semimetals (TSMs) with gapless surface states (Fermi arcs) provide conduction channels resistant to localization. Here we develop an efficient computational framework to quantify 0K surface-state transmission in nanowires derived from Wannier tight-binding models of topological conductors that faithfully reproduce relativistic density functional theory results. Sparse matrix techniques enable scalable simulations incorporating disorder and surface roughness, allowing systematic materials screening across sizes, chemical potentials, and transport directions. A dataset of 3000 surface transmission values reveals TiS, ZrB$_{2}$, and nitrides AN where A=(Mo, Ta, W) as candidates with conductance matching or exceeding copper and benchmark TSMs NbAs and NbP. This dataset further supports machine learning models for rapid interconnect compound identification. Our results highlight the promise of topological conductors in overcoming copper's scaling limits and provide a roadmap for data-driven discovery of next-generation interconnects.</p>

            <p>The technology of silicon anodes appears to be reaching maturity, with high-energy Si cells already in pilot-scale production. However, the performance of these systems can be difficult to replicate in academic settings, making it challenging to translate research findings into solutions that can be implemented by the battery industry. Part of this difficulty arises from the lack of access to engineered Si particles and anodes, as electrode formulations and the materials themselves have become valuable intellectual property for emerging companies. Here, we summarize the efforts by Argonne's Cell Analysis, Modeling, and Prototyping (CAMP) Facility in developing Si-based prototypes made entirely from commercially available materials. We describe the many challenges we encountered when testing high-loading electrodes (> 5 mAh/cm2) and discuss strategies to mitigate them. With the right electrode and electrolyte design, we show that our pouch cells containing > 70 wt% SiOx can achieve 600-1,000 cycles at C/3 and meet projected energy targets of 700 Wh/L and 350 Wh/kg.

            <p>Inspired by the recent experimental advances in cold atom quantum simulators, we explore the experimentally implemented bosonic $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on the square lattice using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. By tuning the doping level $\delta$ and hopping ratio $t'/t$, we uncover six distinct quantum phases, several of which go far beyond the conventional paradigm of phase-coherent superfluidity (SF) expected for bosonic systems. In particular, in the presence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, doped holes are tightly bound into pairs, giving rise to a pair density wave (PDW) phase at low doping and small $|t'/t|$, which is suppressed on the $t'<0$ side, resulting in a disordered PDW state that lacks coherence of either individual bosons or pairs. Upon further doping, bosons can regain phase coherence and form a SF* state, characterized by condensation at emergent incommensurate momenta concurrent with an incommensurate magnetic order. On the $t'>0$ side, the sign-induced kinetic frustration inherently disfavors local AFM correlations, leading to a phase separation in which doped holes cluster into ferromagnetic (FM) domains spatially separated by undoped AFM regions. Upon further doping, this inhomogeneous state evolves into a uniform SF + $xy$-FM phase. Finally, we propose a concrete experimental scheme to realize both signs of $t'/t$ in Rydberg tweezer arrays, with an explicit mapping between model parameters and experimentally accessible regimes. Our results reveal competing and intertwined orders in doped antiferromagnets, which are relevant to central issues in high-$T_c$ superconductivity, reflecting the frustrated interplay between doped holes and spin background.</p>

            <p>Ferroaxial ordering, a spontaneous rotational distortion of the atomic arrangement, brings about a cross-product-type spin--orbit coupling (SOC) manifested as an electric toroidal dipole. We propose the light-induced nonlinear Edelstein effect (NLEE) -- a second-order optical response in which a static magnetization is induced by a time-dependent electric field -- as a promising probe of ferroaxial ordering. First, we elucidate the relationship between the NLEE tensor and the electric toroidal dipole. By decomposing the polarization modes of light, we find that both the linearly polarized and circularly polarized light couple to the electric toroidal dipole via distinct mechanisms. We then demonstrate the NLEE using a minimal model that incorporates ferroaxial ordering. Our analysis reveals that effective coupling between orbital magnetization and SOC induces spin magnetization. In particular, the spin magnetization is tilted owing to the electric toroidal dipole; the tilt angle reflects the ratio between the ferroaxial-origin SOC and the relativistic SOC.</p>

            <p>We develop new methods for approximating conformal blocks as positive functions times polynomials, with applications to the numerical bootstrap. We argue that to obtain accurate bootstrap bounds, conformal block approximations should minimize a certain error norm related to the asymptotics of dispersive functionals. This error norm can be made small using interpolation nodes with an appropriate optimal density. The optimal density turns out to satisfy a kind of force-balance equation for charges in one dimension, which can be solved using standard techniques from large-N matrix models. We also describe how to use optimal density interpolation nodes to improve condition numbers inside the semidefinite program solver SDPB. Altogether, our new approximation scheme and improvements to condition numbers lead to more accurate bootstrap bounds with fewer computational resources. They were crucial in the recent bootstrap study of stress tensors in the 3d Ising CFT.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Theerthagiri, Rajesh Narayanan, R. Ganesh</p>
            <p>Quantum mechanics allows for light-matter setups that hold excitations without releasing them as light. Arising from destructive interference processes, they are best seen in a Tavis-Cummings-like setup where two-level atoms (or qubits) are placed within a lossy cavity. If the system is initialized with some qubits excited and some in the ground state, there is a non-zero probability that no photons will be emitted. This can be framed as a Stern-Gerlach measurement, with a detector to measure if one or more photons leave the cavity. If no photons are detected, the qubits collapse onto a dark state. This can be viewed as heralding of a dark state based on zero photon detection. Building upon this idea, we propose a protocol to measure the number of independent dark states. Moreover, we show that this quantity is robust to arbitrary levels of disorder in the qubit-photon coupling constants. We then discuss a phase transition where the number of dark states plays the role of an order parameter. This provides an exciting example of a phase transition that is completely insensitive to disorder.</p>

            <p>Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5\!+\!1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.</p>

The core of the radiometer is a GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well structure forming a magnetoplasmonic cavity, containing an ultrahigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, which realizes a tunable epsilon-near-zero resonance in the terahertz frequency range. By controlling the orientation of the cavity within a strong external magnetic field, both the resonance frequency and the axion-induced current are optimized $\textit{in situ}$, enabling efficient scanning across a broad mass range without complex mechanical adjustment. The axion-induced electromagnetic signal radiatively emitted from the magnetoplasmonic cavity is detected by a state-of-the-art photodetector. We present the theoretical basis for resonant enhancement, detail the experimental design and benchmarks through extensive simulations, and project the sensitivity of $\texttt{SQWARE}$ for several realistic configurations. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SQWARE}$ can probe the well-motivated quantum chromodynamics axion parameter space and close a critical gap in direct searches at meV masses.</p>

            <h2>Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surajit Bera, Igor V. Gornyi, Sumilan Banerjee, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Kilovolt-Class $β-Ga_2O_3$ Field-Plated Schottky Barrier Diodes with MOCVD-Grown Intentionally $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ Doped Drift Layers</h2>

            <p>We report on the growth optimization of intentionally low-doped ($10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$) high-quality $\beta-Ga_2O_3$ drift layers up to 10 $\mu m$ thick via MOCVD and the fabrication of kilovolt-class field plated Schottky barrier diodes on these thick drift layers. Homoepitaxial growth was performed on (010) $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ substrates using TMGa as the Ga precursor. Growth parameters were systematically optimized to determine the best conditions for high quality thick growths with the given reactor geometry. Chamber pressure was found to improve the growth rate, mobility, and roughness of the samples. Growth rates of up to 7.2 $\mu m$/hr., thicknesses of up to 10 $\mu m$, Hall mobilities of up to 176 $cm^2$/Vs, RMS roughness down to 5.45 nm, UID concentrations as low as $2 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$, and controllable intentional doping down to $3 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ were achieved. Field plated Schottky barrier diodes (FP-SBDs) were fabricated on a $6.5 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ intentionally doped 10 $\mu m$ thick film to determine the electrical performance of the MOCVD-grown material. The FP-SBD was found to have current density $>$100 A/$cm^2$ at 3 V forward bias with a specific differential on resistance ($R_{on,sp}$) of 16.22 m$\Omega$.$cm^2$ and a turn on voltage of 1 V. The diodes were found to have high quality anode metal/semiconductor interfaces with an ideality factor of 1.04, close to unity. Diodes had a maximum breakdown voltage of 1.50 kV, leading to a punch-through maximum field of 2.04 MV/cm under the anode metal, which is a state-of-the-art result for SBDs on MOCVD-grown (010) drift layers.</p>

            <p>Solid-state spins are promising as interfaces from stationary qubits to single photons for quantum communication technologies. Semiconductor quantum dots have excellent optical coherence, exhibit near unity collection efficiencies when coupled to photonic structures, and possess long-lived spins for quantum memory. However, the incompatibility of performing optical spin control and single-shot readout simultaneously has been a challenge faced by almost all solid-state emitters. To overcome this, we leverage light-hole mixing to realize a highly asymmetric lambda system in a negatively charged heavy hole exciton in Faraday configuration. By compensating GHz-scale differential Stark shifts, induced by unequal coupling to Raman control fields, and by performing nuclear-spin cooling, we achieve quantum control of an electron-spin qubit with a $\pi$-pulse contrast of 97.4% while preserving spin-selective optical transitions with a cyclicity of 409. We demonstrate this scheme for both GaAs and InGaAs quantum dots, and show that it is compatible with the operation of a nuclear quantum memory. Our approach thus enables repeated emission of indistinguishable photons together with qubit control, as required for single-shot readout, photonic cluster-state generation, and quantum repeater technologies.</p>

            <p>From genomes and ecosystems to bureaucracies and cities, the growth of complex systems occurs by adding new types of functions and expanding existing ones. We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.</p>

            <p>Electrons bound to the surface of superfluid helium have been proposed for scalable charge and spin-based quantum computing. However single electron quantum measurement in this system has remained elusive. Here we use a hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic (cQED) device that comprises a quantum dot and a high-impedance superconducting resonator to demonstrate, for the first time, strong coupling between the resonator microwave field and the motional quantum state of the electron. We find a coupling strength between the electron motion and a resonator photon of $g/2\pi=118$ MHz, exceeding both the electron motional state decoherence and the resonator loss. These experiments open new avenues for investigating light-matter interaction at the single electron level, and are a key step towards measurement and control of electrons on helium-based spin qubits.</p>

            <h2>Decoded Quantum Interferometry Requires Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric R. Anschuetz, David Gamarnik, Jonathan Z. Lu</p>
            <p>We study the performance of Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) on typical instances of MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT when the transpose of the constraint matrix is drawn from a standard ensemble of LDPC parity check matrices. We prove that if the decoding step of DQI corrects up to the folklore efficient decoding threshold for LDPC codes, then DQI is obstructed by a topological feature of the near-optimal space of solutions known as the overlap gap property (OGP). As the OGP is widely conjectured to exactly characterize the performance of state-of-the-art classical algorithms, this result suggests that DQI has no quantum advantage in optimizing unstructured MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances. We also give numerical evidence supporting this conjecture by showing that approximate message passing (AMP)--a classical algorithm conjectured to saturate the OGP threshold--outperforms DQI on a related ensemble of MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances. Finally, we prove that depth-$1$ QAOA outperforms DQI at sufficiently large $k$ under the same decoding threshold assumption. Our result follows by showing that DQI is approximately Lipschitz under the quantum Wasserstein metric over many standard ensembles of codes. We then prove that MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT exhibits both an OGP and a related topological obstruction known as the chaos property; this is the first known OGP threshold for MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT at fixed $k$, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we prove that both of these topological properties inhibit approximately Lipschitz algorithms such as DQI from optimizing MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT to large approximation ratio.</p>

            <p>Decoherence errors arising from noisy environments remain a central obstacle to progress in quantum computation and information processing. Quantum error correction (QEC) based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) protocol offers a powerful strategy to overcome this challenge, with successful demonstrations in trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonics. Beyond active QEC, a compelling alternative is to engineer Hamiltonians that intrinsically enforce stabilizers, offering passive protection akin to topological models. Inspired by the GKP encoding scheme, we implement a superconducting qubit whose eigenstates form protected grid states - long envisioned but not previously realized - by integrating an effective Cooper-quartet junction with a quantum phase-slip element embedded in a high-impedance circuit. Spectroscopic measurements reveal pairs of degenerate states separated by large energy gaps, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Remarkably, our observations indicate that the circuit tolerates small disorders and gains robustness against environmental noise as its parameters approach the ideal regime, establishing a new framework for exploring superconducting hardware. These findings also showcase the versatility of the superconducting circuit toolbox, setting the stage for future exploration of advanced solid-state devices with emergent properties.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. V. Flambaum</p>
            <p>Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).</p>

            <h2>Krylov complexity and Wightman power spectrum with positive chemical potentials in Schrödinger field theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng-Zhang He, Lei-Hua Liu, Hai-Qing Zhang, Qing-Quan Jiang</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate the Krylov complexity of fermionic fields in Schrödinger field theory as the chemical potential is positive, validated by the engineered Wightman power spectra. For non-positive chemical potentials, the Lanczos coefficients exhibit linear behaviors with respect to $n$. However, as the chemical potential becomes positive, a dynamical transition occurs -- Lanczos coefficient $b_{n}$ develops a two-stage linear growth profile, transitioning from an initial slope of $\pi/\beta$ to the asymptotic slope of $2/\beta$; while Lanczos coefficient $a_{n}$ shows a deflection from near-zero values to linear descent with slope $-4/\beta$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature. Moreover, the engineered power spectra are used to study the evolution of the Krylov complexity and some universal behaviors are uncovered -- the single-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum results in the quadratic growth of the complexity, consistent with that from the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebraic construction. Conversely, the double-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum restores the exponential growth of the complexity, satisfying the maximal chaos bound. These results may provide new insights into the profound impact of chemical potential on the operator growth and Krylov complexity in the quantum field theory.</p>

            <h2>Towards universal property prediction in Cartesian space: TACE is all you need</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zemin Xu, Wenbo Xie, Daiqian Xie, P. Hu</p>
            <p>Machine learning has revolutionized atomistic simulations and materials science, yet current approaches often depend on spherical-harmonic representations. Here we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion and Tensor Moment Potential, the first unified framework formulated entirely in Cartesian space for the systematic prediction of arbitrary structure-determined tensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments into a complete hierarchy of (irreducible) Cartesian tensors, ensuring symmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and equivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal embeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including basis sets, charges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control over external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range interactions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation module within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet computationally efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions. We demonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with or surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and extended materials, including in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra, hessians, external-field response, charged systems, magnetic systems, multi-fidelity training, and heterogeneous catalytic systems. Crucially, TACE bridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space paradigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of spherical-harmonic-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new generation of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of systematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material properties within a single coherent framework.</p>

            <p>Hybrid nanostructures from metal nanoparticles equipped with conducting polymer shells are of great interest for use as functional materials in sensing and optoelectronics, as well as for ink-deposited conductors. Here, we investigate the charge transport mechanism of nanostructures composed of gold nanoparticles coated with a polyaniline shell (Au@PANI). In particular, we focus on how geometry influences the charge transport behavior. Highly ordered linear assemblies of Au@PANI nanoparticles were fabricated using template-assisted assembly, while bulk-like films were obtained via drop-casting. Temperature-dependent transport measurements were analyzed using established theoretical models. Linear assemblies exhibit more localized transport, characterized by variable-range hopping (VRH) and thermally assisted tunneling (TAT), whereas bulk-like films show more delocalized transport, dominated by Arrhenius-type and thermionic conduction. These findings highlight the critical role of geometry in determining charge transport mechanisms in nanoparticle-based hybrid systems.</p>

            <p>Kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) offer broadband near-quantum-limited amplification with high saturation power. Due to the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials, KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground plane) while $\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the search for axion dark matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Doyon</p>
            <p>The notion of twist fields has played a fundamental role in many-body physics. It is used to construct the so-called disorder parameter for the study of phase transitions in the classical Ising model of statistical mechanics, it is involved in the Jordan-Wigner transformation in quantum chains and bosonisation in quantum field theory, and it is related to measures of entanglement in many-body quantum systems. I provide a pedagogical introduction to the notion of twist field and the concepts at its roots, and review some of its applications, focussing on 1+1 dimension. This includes: locality and extensivity, internal symmetries, semi-locality, the standard exponential form and height fields, path integral defects and Riemann surfaces, topological invariance, and twist families. Additional topics touched upon include renormalisation and form factors in relativistic quantum field theory, tau functions of integrable PDEs, thermodynamic and hydrodynamic principles, and branch-point twist fields for entanglement entropy. One-dimensional quantum systems such as chains (e.g. quantum Heisenberg model) and field theory (e.g. quantum sine-Gordon model) are the main focus, but I also explain how the notion applies to equilibrium statistical mechanics (e.g. classical Ising lattice model), and how some aspects can be adapted to one-dimensional classical dynamical systems (e.g. classical Toda chain).</p>

This paper addresses the fundamental problem of checking whether claimed crystals are novel, not noisy perturbations of known materials obtained by unrealistic atomic replacements.

The proposed Lipschitz continuity under noise is a new essential requirement for machine learning on any data objects that have ambiguous representations and live in continuous spaces. For periodic point sets under isometry (any distance-preserving transformation), we designed invariants that distinguish all known counter-examples to the completeness of past descriptors and confirm thousands of (near-)duplicates in the world's largest databases of inorganic crystals within hours on a desktop computer.</p>

The setting is a homogeneous isotropic elastic body containing an inclusion separated by a thin interface endowed with higher-order surface energy.

To address the inverse shape problem, we adapt the factorization method to account for the complications introduced by the higher-order boundary operator and its nontrivial null space. Numerical experiments illustrate the feasibility of the approach, indicating that the framework potentially provides a practical tool for nondestructive detection of interior inhomogeneities, including damaged subvolumes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruochen Ma, Vedika Khemani, Shengqi Sang</p>
            <p>Quantum phases at zero temperature can be characterized as equivalence classes under local unitary transformations: two ground states within a gapped phase can be transformed into each other via a local unitary circuit. We generalize this circuit-based characterization of phases to systems at finite-temperature thermal equilibrium described by Gibbs states. We construct a channel circuit that approximately transforms one Gibbs state into another provided the two are connected by a path in parameter space along which a certain correlation-decay condition holds. For finite-dimensional systems of linear size $L$ and approximation error $\epsilon$, the locality of the circuit is ${\rm polylog}({\rm poly}(L)/\epsilon)$. The correlation-decay condition, which we specify, is expected to be satisfied in the interior of many noncritical thermal phases, including those displaying discrete symmetry breaking and topological order. As an application, we show that any system in the same thermal phase as a zero-temperature topological code coherently preserves quantum information for a macroscopically long time, establishing self-correction as a universal property of thermal phases. As part of the proof, we provide explicit encoding and decoding channel circuits to encode information into, and decode it from, a system in thermal equilibrium.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Mori, L. Mahadevan</p>
            <p>When navigating complex environments, animals often combine multiple strategies to mitigate the effects of external disturbances. These modalities often correspond to different sources of information, leading to speed-accuracy trade-offs. Inspired by the intermittent reorientation strategy seen in the behavior of the dung beetle, we consider the problem of the navigation strategy of a correlated random walker moving in two dimensions. We assume that the heading of the walker can be reoriented to the preferred direction by paying a fixed cost as it tries to maximize its total displacement in a fixed direction. Using optimal control theory, we derive analytically and confirm numerically the strategy that maximizes the walker's speed, and show that the average time between reorientations scales inversely with the magnitude of the environmental noise. We then extend our framework to describe execution errors and sensory acquisition noise. As a result, we provide a range of testable predictions and suggest new experimental directions. Our approach may be amenable to other navigation problems involving multiple sensory modalities that require switching between egocentric and geocentric strategies.</p>

Moreover, geometric phases in spin waves are interesting from a fundamental perspective as they contain information about spin wave band structures and play an important role in magnon Hall effects. In this paper we propose to directly measure geometric phases in spin wave systems using the magnetic field sensing capabilities of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. We demonstrate the general principles of this method on two systems in which spin waves acquire a geometric phase, namely a wire with a magnetic domain wall and a system with position-dependent anisotropy axes, and explicitly show how this phase can be deduced from the NV center signal.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Han Hsiao</p>
            <p>We establish a precise formal correspondence between a spinless p-wave chiral fermionic superfluid and a spinless bosonic superfluid in a strong magnetic field by correctly accounting for superfluid vorticity in the effective theory of the former. In the literature, this vorticity term incompletely manifests as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution can be understood as a truncation within the relevant expansion scheme, accompanied by field redefinitions. The components discarded in this truncation are critical for restoring the Berry phase term in the effective theory, encapsulating both systems in the same master Lagrangian. Beyond clarifying the structure of the Berry phase, this formalism allows for solving the bosonic system in the lowest Landau level (LLL) by analogy. Specifically, we show that, in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing these systems are identical when the vortex crystal is reformulated using an auxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified perspective on these systems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants, and physically interpretable.</p>

            <p>Driving coherent lattice motion with THz pulses has emerged as a novel pathway for achieving dynamic stabilization of exotic phases that are inaccessible in equilibrium quantum materials. In this work, we present a previously unexplored mechanism for THz excitation of Raman-active phonons in semimetals. We show that intense THz pulses centered at 1 THz can excite the Raman-active $A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 2.9 THz in a bismuth film. We rule out the possibilities of the phonon being excited through conventional anharmonic coupling to other modes or via a THz sum frequency process. Instead, we demonstrate that the THz-driven tunnel ionization provides a plausible means of creating a displacive driving force to initiate the phonon oscillations. Our work highlights a new mechanism for exciting coherent phonons, offering potential for dynamic control over the electronic and structural properties of semimetals and narrow-band semiconductors on ultrafast timescales.</p>

            <p>We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally observed Jain states at lattice filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to the vicinity of $\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states. These include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with non-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling $2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.</p>

            <h2>Itinerant electron metamagnetism for lattices with van Hove density-of-states singularities near the Fermi level</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. A. Vasilevskiy, P. A. Igoshev, V. Yu. Irkhin</p>
            <p>Itinerant-electron metamagnetism is investigated within the Hubbard model for various lattices having van Hove singularities (vHS) in the electronic spectrum: face-centered cubic and orthorhombic lattices. The remarkable itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition occurs provided that the Fermi level is in the region with a strong positive curvature of the density of electron states typically positioned between two close van Hove singularities. Orthorhombic distortion of a~tetragonal lattice is a promising mechanism for generating two closely split vHS with strong density-of-states curvature between them. A phase diagram in terms of electron filling and Hubbard interaction parameter is presented, which shows the paramagnetic-metamagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition and regions of saturated and non-saturated magnetism. The standard Landau theory expansion based on~the~electron density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level is demonstrated to be insufficient to describe the whole magnetic phase diagram including the itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition.</p>

            <h2>Collapse of edge reconstruction in compressible Quantum Hall fluid within filling fraction range 2/3 to 1</h2>

            <p>The edge structure of a gate-defined compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 is studied using the three reconstructed $e^2/3h$ fractional edge modes of unity filling integer quantum Hall state. We find that the individually excited partially resolved $e^2/3h$ edge modes of the bulk state equilibrate completely even at higher magnetic field when passing through the gate defined compressible fluid with filling between 2/3 and 1. This result is unexpected because edge reconstruction at the smooth boundary is generally expected due to dominant incompressibility at filling 2/3 and 1/3. Recently such reconstructed edge mode has been reported for the compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3. In contrary, equilibration of fractional edge modes in the compressible fluid within the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 becomes faster with increasing magnetic field. This anomalous results will stimulate further investigations on edge structure in these complex many body systems.</p>

This phenomenon has been demonstrated across various superconducting platforms, which typically necessitate unconventional materials with broken spatial symmetries or external magnetic fields, posing scalability and integration challenges. This work introduces an innovative method to realize the superconducting diode effect by disrupting spatiotemporal symmetries in a conventional Josephson junction utilizing a biharmonic alternating-current (AC) drive signal. We achieve wireless modulation of the diode's polarity and efficiency with an antenna. Our findings indicate a diode efficiency reaching the ideal $100%$ over a broad frequency range, with a temperature resilience of up to 800 mK, and efficient AC signal rectification.

            <h2>Sign competing sources of Berry curvature and anomalous Hall conductance humps in topological ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wojciech Brzezicki, Carmine Autieri, Mario Cuoco</p>
            <p>The use of Berry-phase concepts has established a strong link between the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the topological character of the Hall currents. However, the occurrence of sign competition in the Berry curvature often hinders the topological origin of the observed anomalous Hall effects. Here, we study a two-dimensional topological ferromagnet with coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom to assess the anomalous Hall effects in the presence of sign-competing sources of Berry curvature. We show that 2D itinerant topological ferromagnets described by t2g electronic states can generally lead to topological metallic bands marked by a non-zero Chern number. We find that the resulting Berry curvature at the Fermi level exhibits a characteristic anisotropic profile with a non-monotonous angular dependence when the magnetization is reversed. The sign change of the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductance can occur together with topological transitions or be driven by the population imbalance of the topological bands. The breaking of the inversion symmetry introduces the orbital Rashba coupling in the system. The interplay between the orbital Rashba and sign competing sources of Berry curvature leads to anomalies in the anomalous Hall conductance at values of magnetic fields for which the magnetization switches its orientation. The humps in topological ferromagnets arise when the anomalous Hall conductivity is small in absolute value and they can be detected only close to the sign-change of the AHE and far from half-filling. This study could be relevant for the family of the topological 2D ferromagnets as well as Weyl ferromagnets, and can particularly account for the variety of unconventional behaviors observed in ultrathin films of SrRuO$_3$.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets are a novel class of magnetic materials that bridge the gap between ferromagnets (FMs) and antiferromagnets (AFMs). A key feature is the non-degeneracy of magnon modes where spin splitting occurs, leading to chirality and direction-dependent magnon dispersions governed by symmetry. We explore this in metallic g-wave altermagnets (\(TPn\), where \(T\)= V, Cr; \(Pn\)= As, Sb, Bi) using density functional and many-body perturbation theories. We analyze the influence of pnictogen substitution on spin splitting and magnon behavior. We uncover anisotropic magnon band splitting aligned with electronic structure, and wavevector- and chirality-dependent damping due to Stoner excitations. We identify regions in the Brillouin zone where the chiral magnon splitting overcomes the damping. These findings suggest altermagnets are promising for spintronic and magnonic technologies, where direction-dependent magnon lifetimes and nonreciprocal magno transport may enable chiral magnon propagation, while wavevector-selective damping could be harnessed for fast and controllable magnetization switching.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakub Valdhans, Petr Klenovský</p>
            <p>We have theoretically studied the G-center in bulk silicon material using the empirical tight-binding model for calculations of unfolded band structures with configuration interaction correction for the exciton at $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. The G-center in B configuration (emissive) being a candidate structure as the telecom single- and entangled-photon source has two substitutional carbons and one interstitial atom embedded into the bulk in six equally possible configurations. Taking the advantage of the low computation effort of the tight-binding and unfolding approach, it is possible to calculate and analyze the behavior of a variety of the electronic configurations. Our tight-binding model is able to describe not only the behavior of the G-center in the silicon bulk but using the unfolding approach it can also pinpoint the contributions of different elements of the supercell on the final pseudo-band structure. Moreover, the configuration interaction correction with single-particle basis states computed by our unfolded tight-binding model predicts a very small fine-structure splitting of the ground state exciton both for bright and dark doublet in the studied system. That underscores the possibility of the silicon G-center to become a very good emitter of single and entangled photons for quantum communication and computation applications.</p>

            <h2>Thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au metallic alloys determined by resonant scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kacper Pryga, Bartlomiej Wiendlocha</p>
            <p>This work presents a theoretical study of the electronic structure and transport properties of Ni-Au alloys, recently identified as excellent thermoelectric metals with a power factor significantly exceeding that of conventional semiconductor thermoelectrics. Using first-principles calculations based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the coherent-potential approximation (KKR-CPA) and the Kubo-Greenwood formalism, we demonstrate the key role of resonant scattering in determining the thermoelectric properties of these alloys. This is supported by calculated densities of states, Bloch spectral functions, electrical conductivity, and thermopower. Alloying Ni with Au not only induces resonant scattering but also leads to the formation of a flat band below the Fermi level. The combination of these two features results in high thermopower, arising from a transition between resonant and weak scattering regimes near the Fermi level. Our findings are further compared with analogous calculations for constantan, a Ni-Cu alloy long regarded as a reference thermoelectric metal. We show that differences between the Ni-Au and Ni-Cu systems explain why Ni-Au exhibits nearly twice the thermopower of Ni-Cu. Finally, we simulate the effect of lattice parameter variation on the thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au and suggest that this is a promising pathway for further enhancement, for example through additional alloying or layer deposition.</p>

            <h2>Mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Róbert Juhász</p>
            <p>Based on the strong-disorder renormalization group method, a microscopic mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain is proposed, which represents the annealing process as a gradual aggregation of strongly coupled spin clusters. The ferromagnetic ground state of clusters is either preserved or get excited in pairwise fusions of clusters, depending on the effective annealing rate of the fusion, the latter events being responsible for the appearance of defects in the final state. A consequence of the theory is that, although the Griffiths-McCoy phases surrounding the critical point are gapless, they are still effectively gapped from the point of view of quantum annealing. Thereby we provide an explanation of the finiteness of gap outside of the critical point, which was implicit in an early approach to the problem by Kibble-Zurek scaling [Dziarmaga, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 74}, 064416 (2006)]. Furthermore, by identifying the accessible excitations, we refine the functional form of the vanishing of the gap at the critical point. The defect density in the final state is found to decrease with the annealing time $\tau$, as $n(\tau)\sim \ln^{-2}\left(\frac{\tau}{\ln^2\tau}\right)$ for large $\tau$. In addition to this, our approach gives access also to the density of defects at intermediate times of the annealing process.</p>

            <p>The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, where the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional copper-oxygen planes, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at sub-gap millielectronvolt energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers. However, within the copper-oxygen planes the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply sub-diffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near-field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance-absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase-and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum- and frequency dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. These results establish a new platform for investigating superfluid phenomena at finite momenta and THz frequencies, highlighting the potential to engineer and visualize superconducting devices operating at ultrafast THz rates.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergent interactions between two active Brownian particles coupled by an attractive harmonic potential and in contact with a thermal reservoir. By analyzing the stationary distribution of their separation, we demonstrate that the effective interaction can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the interplay between activity, coupling strength, and temperature. Notably, we find that an effective short-range repulsion emerges in the strong and moderate-coupling regimes, when the temperature is below some threshold value, which we characterize analytically. In the strong-coupling regime, the repulsion emerges solely due to the difference in the self-propulsion speeds of the particles. We also compute the short-time position distribution of the centroid of the coupled particles, which shows strongly non-Gaussian fluctuations at low temperatures.</p>

Within a transition region discontinuous voltage jumps and hysteretic behaviour of the I-V characteristics are observed, associated with the destruction and recovery of the superconducting order parameter in the island. The strength of the two features varies strongly in different devices in a mutually correlated way and can be suppressed by a small magnetic field. Numerical calculation explains this behaviour in terms of a tiny non-equilibrium correction to the electronic energy distribution at low energies. The experiment demonstrates a critical failure of a two-temperature non-equilibrium model of the superconductor-normal transition in floating islands of hybrid nanowire devices.</p>

In this article, we develop a theory of the bilinear response of FN bilayers and NFN trilayers for finite frequencies $\omega$ of the driving field and for four contributions that have been previously considered in the literature: Joule heating, phonon-mediated unidirectional magnetoresistance, the spin-torque diode effect, and magnonic unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance. We identify their distinct dependencies on frequency and the magnetization direction of the magnetic insulator and examine their scaling with magnetic field and system geometry, providing a framework for experimental differentiation.</p>

            <p>The major challenge in determining a hyperelastic model for a given material is the choice of invariants and the selection how the strain energy function depends functionally on these invariants. Here we introduce a new data-driven framework that simultaneously discovers appropriate invariants and constitutive models for isotropic incompressible hyperelastic materials. Our approach identifies both the most suitable invariants in a class of generalized invariants and the corresponding strain energy function directly from experimental observations. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed invariant choices or sequential fitting procedures, our method integrates the discovery process into a single neural network architecture. By looking at a continuous family of possible invariants, the model can flexibly adapt to different material behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using popular benchmark datasets for rubber and brain tissue. For rubber, the method recovers a stretch-dominated formulation consistent with classical models. For brain tissue, it identifies a formulation sensitive to small stretches, capturing the nonlinear shear response characteristic of soft biological matter. Compared to traditional and neural-network-based models, our framework provides improved predictive accuracy and interpretability across a wide range of deformation states. This unified strategy offers a robust tool for automated and physically meaningful model discovery in hyperelasticity.</p>

            <p>The detection of fractionally charged quasiparticles, which arise in the fractional quantum Hall regime, is of fundamental importance for probing their exotic quantum properties. While electronic interferometers have been central to probe their statistical properties, their interpretation is often complicated by bulk-edge interactions. Antidots, potential hills in the quantum Hall regime, are particularly valuable in this context, as they overcome the geometric limitations of conventional designs and act as controlled impurities within a quantum point contact. Furthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle charge detection through straightforward conductance measurements, replacing the need for more demanding techniques. In this work, we employ a gate-defined bilayer graphene antidot operating in the Coulomb-dominated regime to study quasiparticle tunneling in both integer and fractional quantum Hall states. We show that the gate-voltage period and the oscillation slope directly reveal the charge of the tunneling quasiparticles, providing a practical method to measure fractional charge in graphene. We report direct measurements of fractional charge, finding $q = e/3$ at $\nu = 4/3$, 5/3 and 7/3, $q = 2e/3$ at $\nu = 2/3$ and $q = 3e/5$ at $\nu = 3/5$, while at $\nu = 8/3$ we observe signatures of both $e/3$ and $2e/3$ tunneling charge. The simplicity and tunability of this design open a pathway to extend antidot-based charge measurements to other van der Waals materials, establishing antidots as a powerful and broadly applicable platform to study the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Since the discovery of cuprate high-Tc superconductivity, numerous theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain its mechanism; Anderson's RVB picture [Science 235, 1196-1198, 1987] and U(1) gauge theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 503-506, 1996] motivate a minimal one-band view that largely integrates out oxygen. By contrast, altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. X 12, 040501, 2022] yields a d-wave-like k-space magnetic texture from alternatingly rotated nonmagnetic cages; La2CuO4 (the parent of a high-Tc cuprate) is a prototypical example. As a proof of principle, we show in La2CuO4 that an alternating local pairing potential on the two Cu sublattices (plus/minus s(r)) produces a nodal, d-wave-like Delta(k). As orthorhombic tilts are, however, not the driver (and even suppress superconductivity in nickelates; [Nature 621, 493, (2023)], we then show that the in-plane oxygen sublattice of CuO2/NiO2 layers, ubiquitous in cuprates and nickelates, intrinsically realizes the same symmetry. Imposing an oxygen-centered, staggered s pairing yields a d-wave gap with perfect C4 symmetry, demonstrated self-consistently in NdNiO2 from first principles. While the underlying mechanism that drives this order is unclear, we outline possible origins. Further, this description of superconductivity enables mapping a real-space superconducting order parameter onto a lattice picture, allowing superconductivity and Hubbard physics to be treated on the same footing.</p>

            <p>High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is an important method for imaging beam sensitive materials often under cryo conditions. Electron ptychography in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has been shown to reconstruct low-noise phase data at a reduced fluence for such materials. This raises the question of whether ptychography or HRTEM provides a more fluence-efficient imaging technique. Even though the transfer function is a common metric for evaluating the performance of an imaging method, it only describes the signal transfer with respect to spatial frequency, irrespective of the noise transfer. It can also not be well defined for methods, such as ptychography, that use an algorithm to form the final image. Here we apply the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron microscopy as a fluence independent and sample independent measure of technique performance. We find that, for a weak-phase object, ptychography can never reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but that ptychography is more robust to partial coherence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyuan Zhu, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the out-of-plane lattice spacing increases with decreasing thickness. We resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. The principle also extends to perovskite ferroelectrics such as PbTiO$_3$, offering a strategy to eliminate critical thickness limits by selecting appropriate film orientations. As a practical pathway to device integration, we also identify the two-dimensional electride Ca$_2$N as a near-ideal electrode that fully restores the ferroelectric properties of HfO$_2$ in ultrathin capacitors.</p>

The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary charge current and the spin current of the magnons), and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics.</p>

We derive measurable corrections in THC that align well with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.</p>

            <p>We discuss U(1) lattice gauge theory models based on a modified Villain formulation of the gauge action, which allows coupling to bosonic electric and magnetic matter. The formulation enjoys a duality which maps electric and magnetic sectors into each other. We propose several generalizations of the model and discuss their 't~Hooft anomalies. A particularly interesting class of theories is the one where electric and magnetic matter fields are coupled with identical actions, such that for a particular value of the gauge coupling the theory has a self-dual symmetry. The self-dual symmetry turns out to be a generator of a group which is a central extension of $\mathbb Z_4$ by the lattice translation symmetry group. The simplest case amenable to numerical simulations is the case when there is exactly one electrically and one magnetically charged boson. We discuss the phase structure of this theory and the nature of the self-dual symmetry in detail. Using a suitable worldline representation of the system we present the results of numerical simulations that support the conjectured phase diagram.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum processors require high-fidelity universal quantum logic operations in a manufacturable physical platform. Donors in silicon provide atomic size, excellent quantum coherence and compatibility with standard semiconductor processing, but no entanglement between donor-bound electron spins has been demonstrated to date. Here we present the experimental demonstration and tomography of universal 1- and 2-qubit gates in a system of two weakly exchange-coupled electrons, bound to single phosphorus donors introduced in silicon by ion implantation. We surprisingly observe that the exchange interaction has no effect on the qubit coherence. We quantify the fidelity of the quantum operations using gate set tomography (GST), and we use the universal gate set to create entangled Bell states of the electrons spins, with fidelity ~ 93%, and concurrence 0.91 +/- 0.08. These results form the necessary basis for scaling up donor-based quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Phase Recognition in Two Dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leon C. Sander, Nathan A. McMahon, Petr Zapletal, Michael J. Hartmann</p>
            <p>Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are quantum circuits for characterizing complex quantum states. They have been proposed for recognizing quantum phases of matter at low sampling cost and have been designed for condensed matter systems in one dimension. Here we construct a QCNN that can perform phase recognition in two dimensions and correctly identify the phase transition from a Toric Code phase with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological order to the paramagnetic phase. The network also exhibits a noise threshold up to which the topological order is recognized. Furthermore, it captures correlations between all stabilizer elements of the Toric Code, which cannot be accessed by direct measurements. This increases the threshold for errors leading to such correlations and allows for correctly identifying the topological phase in the presence of strong correlated errors. Our work generalizes phase recognition with QCNNs to higher spatial dimensions and intrinsic topological order, where exploration and characterization via classical numerics become challenging.</p>

            <h2>Synaptic Theory of Chunking in Working Memory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weishun Zhong, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks</p>
            <p>Working memory often appears to exceed its basic span by organizing items into compact representations called chunks. Chunking can be learned over time for familiar inputs; however, it can also arise spontaneously for novel stimuli. Such on-the-fly structuring is crucial for cognition, yet the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here we introduce a synaptic theory of chunking, in which short-term synaptic plasticity enables the formation of chunk representations in working memory. We show that a specialized population of ``chunking neurons'' selectively controls groups of stimulus-responsive neurons, akin to gating. As a result, the network maintains and retrieves the stimuli in chunks, thereby exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show that our model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within working memory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanism is a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequently retrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memory capacity when chunking is not invoked. Predictions from our model were confirmed by analyzing single-unit responses in epileptic patients and memory experiments with verbal material. Our work provides a novel conceptual and analytical framework for understanding how the brain organizes information in real time.</p>

            <p>Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Subspace-based quantum diagonalization methods offer a viable alternative for pre- and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then demonstrate the scalability of our approach by performing the largest ground-state quantum simulation of impurity models using a Heron quantum processors and the Frontier supercomputer. We consider both the single-impurity Anderson model with 41 bath sites, and a system with 4 impurities and 7 bath sites per impurity. Our results are in excellent agreement with Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations.</p>

            <p>The use of nuclear spins for quantum computation is limited by the difficulty in creating genuine quantum entanglement between distant nuclei. Current demonstrations of nuclear entanglement in semiconductors rely upon coupling the nuclei to a common electron, which is not a scalable strategy. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit Control-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atoms binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prepare and measure a nuclear Bell state with a fidelity of 76 +/- 5 $\%$ and a concurrence of 0.67 +/- 0.05. With this method, future progress in scaling up semiconductor spin qubits can be extended to the development of nuclear-spin based quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Energy transport in holographic non-conformal interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Liu, Chuan-Yi Wang, You-Jie Zeng</p>
            <p>We study energy transport in a system of two dimensional conformal field theories exchanging energy across a non-conformal interface involving a localised scalar operator, using holographic duality. By imposing the sourceless boundary condition, or equivalently, enforcing energy conservation at the interface, we show that the sum of the transmission and reflection coefficients is equal to one. Unlike conformal interfaces, we find that both the energy transmission and reflection coefficients are generally complex and frequency dependent. When the interface brane connects two distinct AdS$_2$ geometries, the transmission coefficient approaches the value expected for a conformal interface in the UV regime at high frequencies and in the IR regime at low frequencies. In the intermediate frequency range, the transmission coefficient may exhibit oscillatory behavior. Moreover, we present a nontrivial example of a fully transmissive interface, which exhibits similarities to a topological interface.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous matrix product operator symmetries and 1D mixed-state phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Qi Sun</p>
            <p>Generalized symmetries have emerged as a powerful organizing principle for exotic quantum phases. However, their role in open quantum systems, especially for non-invertible cases, remains largely unexplored. We address this by applying a unified tensor-network framework for mixed states with fusion categorical symmetry, which encompasses both invertible and non-invertible ones represented as matrix product operators, and reveals novel quantum phases unique to the open-system setting through the lens of quantum anomalies. In contrast to pure states, where anomalies forbid symmetric short-range correlated phases in one dimension, we construct a broad class of renormalization fixed-point mixed states with zero correlation length given arbitrary strong anomalous fusion categorical symmetry. These states, representing nontrivial mixed-state phases of matter, cannot be efficient prepared via local quantum channels, indicating anomaly-enforced long-range entanglement in the absence of local correlations. Despite this obstruction, we further provide constructions of measurement-enhanced quantum circuits to prepare all these constructed states, offering a practical way to realize and probe anomalous generalized symmetries in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure, and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance, and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance, and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology, and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.</p>

            <p>The background field formalism based on effective actions is a compelling framework for developing an effective field theory for nuclear density functional theory. Among the challenges in carrying out this development is handling both the particle-hole and pairing channels beyond the mean-field level, which includes how to incorporate collective degrees of freedom. Here we use the exactly solvable one-dimensional Gaudin-Yang model as a theoretical laboratory to explore candidate approaches. We compare Variational Perturbation Theory (VPT) to ordinary many-body perturbation theory and the inversion method, all to second order in their respective expansions, and verify issues with Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields. VPT outperforms the other approaches at this level over a wide range of densities. The next steps to extend this approach toward nuclei are outlined.</p>

            <h2>Extending the Limited Performance of the Quantum Refrigerator with Catalysts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Fu, Ousi Pan, Zhiqiang Fan, Yushun Tang, Shanhe Su, Youhui Lin, Jincan Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum thermal machines offer promising platforms for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. The previous study in Ref.[1,2] demonstrated that the incorporation of a catalyst can significantly enhance the performance of a heat engine by broadening its operational regime and achieving a more favorable trade-off between work output and efficiency. Building on this powerful framework and innovative idea, here we further extend the concept to a two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of performance (COP) and cooling capacity to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a catalyst. Furthermore, through a comparison with catalytic heat engines, our analysis reveals that two distinct permutation types are necessary to simultaneously enhance the COP and operational range of refrigerators, in contrast to heat engines for which a single permutation suffices. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass conventional thermodynamic performance limits.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error. Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.</p>

            <h2>From Quantum Tsallis Entropy to Strange Metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian-Hui Ge</p>
            <p>We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from Rényi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.</p>

            <h2>Nematic Enhancement of Superconductivity in Multilayer Graphene via Quantum Geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gal Shavit</p>
            <p>Multilayer graphene materials have recently emerged as a fascinating versatile platform for correlated electron phenomena, hosting superconductivity, fractional quantum Hall states, and correlated insulating phases. A particularly striking experimental observation is the recurring correlation between nematicity in the normal state -- manifested by spontaneous breaking of the underlying $C_3$ symmetry -- and the stabilization of robust superconducting phases. Despite its ubiquity across different materials, devices and experiments, this trend has thus far lacked a clear microscopic explanation. In this work, we identify a concrete mechanism linking nematic order to enhanced superconductivity. We demonstrate that $C_3$-symmetry breaking strongly reshapes the Bloch wavefunctions near the Fermi level, producing a pronounced enhancement and redistribution of the so-called quantum metric. This effect drastically amplifies superconducting pairing mediated by the quantum geometric Kohn-Luttinger mechanism [G. Shavit \it{et al.}, \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 176001 (2025)}]. Our analysis reveals that nematicity naturally boosts the superconducting coupling constant in experimentally relevant density regimes, providing a compelling explanation for observed correlations. These results establish the central role of geometric effects in graphene superconductivity and highlight nematicity as a promising avenue for engineering stronger unconventional superconducting states.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate here that a chain of Bilayer Graphene Quantum Dots (BLGQD) can realize topological quantum matter by effectively simulating a spin-1 chain that hosts the Haldane phase within a specific range of parameters. We describe a chain of BLGQD with two electrons each using an atomistic tight-binding model combined with the exact diagonalization technique to solve the interacting few-electron problem. Coulomb interactions and valley mixing effects are treated within the same microscopic framework, allowing us to systematically investigate spin and valley polarization transitions as functions of interaction strength and external tuning parameters. We calculate the low energy states for single and double QDs as a function of the number of electrons, identifying regimes of highly correlated multi-electron states. We confirm the presence of a spin-one ground state for two electrons. Then, we explore two coupled QDs with 4 electrons and extend the analysis to QD arrays. Using a mapping of the BLGQD chain to an effective bilinear-biquadratic (BLBQ) spin model, we demonstrate that BLGQD arrays can work as a quantum simulator for one-dimensional spin chains with emergent many-body topological phases.</p>

            <p>We explore how the quantum geometric properties of the Bloch wave function, characterized by the Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance, impact magnetic phases in solid-state systems. To this end, we investigate the spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation, considering the onsite Coulomb interaction. We demonstrate that spin susceptibility can be decomposed into a trivial part, dependent solely on the band dispersion, and a geometric part, where the quantum distance plays a crucial role. Focusing on a model of a quadratic band-touching semimetal, we show that a magnetic phase transition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order can be induced solely by tuning the wavefunction geometry, even while the energy spectrum is held constant. This highlights the versatility of quantum geometry as a mechanism for tuning magnetic properties independent of the energy spectrum. Applying our framework to the Fe-pnictide and kagome lattice models, we further show that the geometric contribution is decisive in stabilizing their known antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, respectively. Our work sheds light on the hidden quantum geometric aspects necessary for understanding and engineering magnetic order in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Electric field control of electron charge and spin degrees of freedom is fundamental to modern semiconductor and spintronic devices. Yet controlling electromagnetic waves with an electric field, particularly in the terahertz (THz) band, remains a challenge. Here, we propose a spin-corner-layer coupling (SCLC) mechanism in second-order topological altermagnetic bilayers. By using an electric field to influence electrons between different layers, the SCLC mechanism enables simultaneous control over corner and spin degrees of freedom, thereby allowing electric-field tuning of the absorption, emission intensity, and even polarization of THz waves. Taking bilayer NiZrI$_6$ nanodisks as a prototype, we demonstrate that an ultralow electrostatic field can switch both the spin and the layer polarizations of corner states. This dual switching modulates transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths between different corner states, thereby enabling the manipulation of THz waves. This study establishes a mechanism for the electric-field control of spin and THz waves through SCLC, yielding important implications for the advancement of THz spintronics.</p>

            <p>Long-range propagation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs typically occurs in ferromagnet/$s$-wave superconductor junctions, where net magnetization plays a crucial role. Here, we propose a fundamentally different scenario in which Josephson supercurrents mediated exclusively by spin-triplet pairings emerge in systems with \textit{zero} net magnetization. We identify collinear altermagnets, particularly a subclass termed nodeless altermagnets, as ideal platforms to realize this phenomenon. These materials host spin-split Fermi surfaces that do not intersect altermagnetic nodal lines and support maximal spin-valley polarization, yielding fully spin-polarized electronic states at each valley. Consequently, Josephson junctions based on nodeless altermagnets sustain supercurrents solely through spin-polarized triplet pairing correlations, simultaneously contributed by spin-up Cooper pairs from one valley and spin-down Cooper pairs from the other. Furthermore, controlling the relative local inversion-symmetry breaking at the two interfaces enables a robust 0--$\pi$ transition without fine tuning, while adjusting the junction orientation allows a crossover between pure triplet and mixed singlet-triplet states. Our work thus establishes nodeless altermagnets as a unique platform for altermagnetic superconductors with magnetization-free spin-polarized supercurrents.</p>

            <p>We experimentally investigate the impulsive shock propagation caused by an impact into vertically oriented 3D granular packings under gravity. We observe a crossover of wave propagation, from sound excitation at low impact to shock front formation at high impact. One of our findings is a nonlinear acoustic regime prior to the shock regime in which the wave speed decreases with the particle-velocity amplitude due to frictional sliding and rearrangement. Also, we show that the impulsive shock waves at high impact exhibit a characteristic spatial width of approximately 10 particle diameters, regardless of shock amplitude. This finding is similar to that observed in 1D granular chains and appears to be independent of the contact microstructure, whether involving dry or wet glass beads, or sand particles. The final and main finding is that we observe the coexistence of the shock front and the sound waves (ballistic propagation and multiple scattering), separated by a distinct time interval. This delay increases with impact amplitude, due to the increase shock speed on one hand and the decrease of the elastic modulus (and sound speed) in mechanically weakened granular packings by high impact on the other hand. Introducing a small amount of wetting oil into glass bead packings leads to significant viscous dissipation of scattered acoustic waves, while only slightly affecting the shock waves evidenced by a modest increase in shock front width. Our study reveals that shock-induced sound waves and scattering play an important role in shock wave attenuation within a mechanically weakened granular packing by impact. Investigating impact-driven wave propagation through such a medium also offers one way of interrogating a 3D FPUT-like system where nonlinear and linear forces between grains are involved.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Barzon, Daniel M. Busiello, Giorgio Nicoletti</p>
            <p>Neural circuits exhibit remarkable computational flexibility, enabling adaptive responses to noisy and ever-changing environmental cues. A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns how a wide range of behaviors can emerge from a relatively limited set of underlying biological mechanisms. In particular, the interaction between activities of neuronal populations and plasticity modulation of synaptic connections may endow neural circuits with a variety of functional responses when coordinated over different characteristic timescales. Here, we develop an information-theoretic framework to quantitatively explore this idea. We consider a stochastic model for neural activities that incorporates the presence of a coupled dynamic plasticity and time-varying stimuli. We show that long-term plasticity modulations play the functional role of steering neural activities towards a regime of optimal information encoding. By constructing the associated phase diagram, we demonstrate that either Hebbian or anti-Hebbian plasticity may become optimal strategies depending on how the external input is projected to the target neural populations. Conversely, short-term plasticity enables the discrimination of temporal ordering in sequences of inputs by navigating the emergent multistable attractor landscape. By allowing a degree of variability in external stimuli, we also highlight the existence of an optimal variability for sequence discrimination at a given plasticity strength. In summary, the timescale of plasticity modulation shapes how inputs are represented in neural activities, thereby fundamentally altering the computational properties of the system. Our approach offers a unifying information-theoretic perspective of the role of plasticity, paving the way for a quantitative understanding of the emergence of complex computations in coupled neuronal-synaptic dynamics.</p>

            <p>The magnetisation dynamics of yttrium iron garnet (Y3Fe5O12, YIG) are key to the operation of spintronic and microwave devices. Here, we report a pathway to manipulate the frequency, damping and absorption of YIG thin films via interface coupling. The growth on YIG of PtMn, a metallic antiferromagnet, leads to a power dependence of the oscillation frequency and an increased linewidth at low fields. In gadolinium iron garnet/YIG film bilayers, the two films couple antiferromagnetically at low temperatures and there is a strong damping of the magnetisation dynamics that is further enhanced at the spin-flop field, suppressing the FMR signal. When combining both GdIG and PtMn interfaces, we can tune the exponent of the power dependence of frequency with field and achieve an almost complete quenching of the magnetisation dynamics over a range of fields/frequencies due to non-collinear magnetic order. These effects offer a means to tune and suppress magnetisation dynamics for frequency filters, magnonics, spin pumping and other applications.</p>

When the ring radius greatly exceeds the FDS width, motion is nearly elastic, and we derive the ring-radius equation of motion (EOM) which admits exact solutions. This equation can be recast into a form analogous to the inviscid Rayleigh-Plesset equation governing spherical bubble dynamics in classical fluids, but with anomalous terms. At the ring FDS core, the nematic tensor motion is parameterized by a single parameter that connects the two types of FDSs monotonically. Beyond the hydrodynamics regime, density and spin wave emissions become significant and cause energy loss, shrinking the ring FDS radius oscillation; below a threshold, collapses occur followed by the ring FDS annihilation. In the zero quadratic Zeeman energy limit, the ring radius and eigenvalues of the nematic tensor become stationary, while oscillations of the nematic tensor components, driven by the ring curvature, persist at the core. Excellent agreements are found between analytical predictions and numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>Fate of Topological Dirac Magnons in van der Waals Ferromagnets at Finite Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rintaro Eto, Ignacio Salgado-Linares, Masahito Mochizuki, Johannes Knolle, Alexander Mook</p>
            <p>Dirac magnons, the bosonic counterparts of Dirac fermions in graphene, provide a unique platform to explore symmetry-protected band crossings and quantum geometry in magnetic insulators, while promising high-velocity, low-dissipation spin transport for next-generation magnonic technologies. However, their stability under realistic, finite-temperature conditions remains an open question. Here, we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of thermal magnon-magnon interactions in van der Waals honeycomb ferromagnets, focusing on both gapless and gapped Dirac magnons. Using nonlinear spin-wave theory with magnon self-energy corrections and a T-matrix resummation that captures two-magnon bound states, we quantitatively reproduce temperature- and momentum-dependent energy shifts and linewidths observed experimentally in the gapless Dirac magnon material CrBr$_3$, even near the Curie temperature. Our approach resolves discrepancies between prior theoretical predictions and experiment and highlight the significant role of bound states in enhancing magnon damping at low temperatures. For gapped Dirac magnon materials such as CrI$_3$, CrSiTe$_3$, and CrGeTe$_3$, we find a thermally induced reduction of the topological magnon gap but no evidence of thermally driven topological transitions. Classical atomistic spin dynamics simulations corroborate the gap' s robustness up to the Curie temperature. Furthermore, we establish a practical criterion for observing topological gaps by determining the minimum ratio of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to Heisenberg exchange required to overcome thermal broadening throughout the ordered phase, typically around 5%. Our results clarify the interplay of thermal many-body effects and topology in low-dimensional magnets and provide a reliable framework for interpreting spectroscopic experiments.</p>

            <h2>Three-dimensional magnetization textures as quaternionic functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantin L. Metlov, Andrei B. Bogatyrëv</p>
            <p>Thanks to the recent progress in bulk full three-dimensional nanoscale magnetization distribution imaging, there is a growing interest to three-dimensional (3D) magnetization textures, promising new high information density spintronic applications. Compared to 1D domain walls or 2D magnetic vortices/skyrmions, they are a much harder challenge to represent, analyze and reason about. In this Letter we build analytical representation for such a textures (with arbitrary number of singularity-free hopfions and singular Bloch point pairs) as products of simple quaternionic functions. It can be useful as a language for expressing theoretical models of 3D magnetization textures and specifying a variety of topologically non-trivial initial conditions for micromagnetic simulations.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Design of Amorphous Materials with Targeted Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas A. Finkler, Yan Lin, Tao Du, Jilin Hu, Morten M. Smedskjaer</p>
            <p>Disordered (amorphous) materials, such as glasses, are emerging as promising candidates for applications within energy storage, nonlinear optics, and catalysis. Their lack of long-range order and complex short- and medium-range orderings, which depend on composition as well as thermal and pressure history, offer a vast materials design space. To this end, relying on machine learning methods instead of trial and error is promising, and among these, inverse design has emerged as a tool for discovering novel materials with desired properties. Although inverse design methods based on diffusion models have shown success for crystalline materials and molecules, similar methods targeting amorphous materials remain less developed, mainly because of the limited availability of large-scale datasets and the requirement for larger simulation cells. In this work, we propose and validate an inverse design method for amorphous materials, introducing AMDEN (Amorphous Material DEnoising Network), a diffusion model-based framework that generates structures of amorphous materials. These low-energy configurations are typically obtained through a thermal motion-driven random search-like process that cannot be replicated by standard denoising procedures. We therefore introduce an energy-based AMDEN variant that implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo refinement for generating these relaxed structures. We further introduce several amorphous material datasets with diverse properties and compositions to evaluate our framework and support future development.</p>

            <p>Increasingly intricate phase diagrams in new classes of superconductors host fascinating interactions between superconductivity, diverse quantum phases, and quantum critical dynamics. The native superfluids, however, often exhibit much lower density and much greater inhomogeneity than conventional superfluids. This may render the superconductivity susceptible to fluctuations that are ordinarily assumed to be frozen out far below the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, calling into question the degree to which the superconducting state is fully coherent. In this work, we leverage terahertz spectroscopy to demonstrate strongly fluctuating superconductivity in topological compositions of the multiband iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se). These fluctuations are found to persist undiminished far below $T_c$ and converge upon the limit of Planckian dissipation above $T_c$. These results indicate that extended quantum fluctuations dominate the electrodynamics of both the superconducting and Planckian-dissipative precursor states of Fe(Te,Se), and demonstrate that the assumption of phase coherence must be rigorously validated in emerging classes of unconventional superconductors.</p>

            <p>The Riemann zeta function regularization is employed to extract finite temperature corrections to effective magnetic moment $S^*$ of one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg ferro- and antiferromagnets. Whereas for the one-dimensional ferromagnet we obtain the usual $T^{1/2}$ spin-wave dependence, for the antiferromagnetic chain the dependence is described by a generalized incomplete Riemann function. The quantity $S^*$ determines strong short-range magnetic order in the absence of long-range order, in particular the correlation length. For the one-dimensional ferromagnet, the results are confirmed by the self-consistent spin-wave theory and Monte Carlo simulations by Takahashi et al.</p>

            <h2>Quantum vs Classical Thermal Transport at Low Temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhixing Zou, Jiangbin Gong, Jiao Wang, Giulio Casati, Giuliano Benenti</p>
            <p>This work aims to understand how quantum mechanics affects heat transport at low temperatures. In the classical setting, by considering a simple paradigmatic model, our simulations reveal the emergence of Negative Differential Thermal Resistance (NDTR): paradoxically, increasing the temperature bias by lowering the cold bath temperature reduces the steady-state heat current. In sharp contrast, the quantum version of the model, treated via a Lindblad master equation, exhibits no NDTR: the heat current increases monotonically with thermal bias. This marked divergence highlights the fundamental role of quantum effects in low-temperature thermal transport and underscores the need to reconsider classical predictions when designing and optimizing nanoscale thermal devices.</p>

            <h2>Non-universal Thermal Hall Responses in Fractional Quantum Hall Droplets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Tan, Yuzhu Wang, Xinghao Wang, Bo Yang</p>
            <p>We analytically compute the thermal Hall conductance (THC) of fractional quantum Hall droplets under realistic conditions that go beyond the idealized linear edge theory with conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that align well with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.</p>

            <p>Recently, Jiayi Hu and co-workers reported that they did not resolve any thermal Hall signal in La$_2$CuO$_4$ by `high resolution' measurements, setting an upper bound of $|\kappa_{xy}| <2\times 10^{-3}~$Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 20 K. Two points have apparently escaped their attention. First, thermal Hall signals with an amplitude well below this resolution bound have been detected in disordered perovskites. Second, the longitudinal thermal conductivity of their sample is significantly lower than the La$_2$CuO$_4$ sample displaying a thermal Hall signal. We find that a moderate reduction of $\kappa_{xx}$ in SrTiO$_3$ is concomitant with a drastic attenuation of $\kappa_{xy}$. A trend emerges across several families of insulators: the amplitude of $\kappa_{xy}$ anti-correlates with disorder.</p>

            <h2>Spin-dependent signatures of Majorana modes in thermoelectric transport through double quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Piotr Majek, Ireneusz Weymann</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the spin-dependent thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot system coupled to a topological superconducting nanowire and ferromagnetic leads. The study focuses on the behavior of the Seebeck coefficient and its spin-resolved counterparts, with calculations performed by means of the numerical renormalization group method. We investigate the low-temperature transport regime, where a complex interplay between the two-stage Kondo effect, the ferromagnet-induced exchange field, and the Majorana coupling occurs. We demonstrate that thermoelectric measurements can reveal unique signatures of the Majorana interaction that are challenging to isolate in conductance measurements alone. It is shown that the exchange field fundamentally alters the thermoelectric response, leading to a rich, non-monotonic temperature evolution of the thermopower, which is driven by a temperature-dependent competition between the spin channels. Furthermore, we have identified qualitatively different regimes of spin thermopower generation, controlled by the interplay between the Majorana-induced asymmetry and the spin polarization of the leads. Finally, by connecting the system's thermoelectric response to the underlying transport asymmetries quantified by the conductance spin polarization, we provide a consistent and unified physical picture, proposing thermoelectric transport as a sensitive probe for Majorana signatures.</p>

            <h2>Field-free transverse Josephson diode effect in altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bijay Kumar Sahoo, Abhiram Soori</p>
            <p>We show that altermagnets (AMs) with Rashba spin--orbit coupling can host a transverse Josephson diode effect (TJDE) without any external magnetic field. AMs combine zero net magnetization with spin-polarized Fermi surfaces, enabling the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We propose a four-terminal Josephson junction where a longitudinal phase bias between opposite superconducting terminals generates transverse supercurrents in the unbiased terminals. These transverse currents exhibit both a diode-like nonreciprocity and a finite anomalous phase offset, revealing a transverse anomalous Josephson effect (AJE). For certain parameter regimes, the transverse current becomes unidirectional, and the TJDE efficiency can exceed 1000\%, demonstrating exceptionally strong diode behavior. Remarkably, the magnitude and direction of the TJDE and transverse AJE are tunable by rotating the Néel vector. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for engineering field-free nonreciprocal superconducting transport in multiterminal devices.</p>

            <p>Hybrid two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing interest as platforms for tailoring electronic properties through interfacial design. Very recently, a novel hybrid 2D material termed glaphene, which combines monolayers of 2D silica glass and graphene, was experimentally realized. Inspired by glaphenes, we proposed a new class of similar structures named glaphynes, which are formed by stacking SiO$_2$ monolayers onto $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-graphynes. Graphynes are 2D carbon allotropes with the presence of acetylenic groups (triple bonds). The glaphynes' structural and electronic properties were investigated using the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) method, as implemented in the DFTB+ package. Our analysis confirms their energetic and structural stability. We have observed that in the case of glaphynes, the electronic proximity effect can indeed open the electronic band gap, but not for all cases, even with the formation of Si-O-C bonds between silica and graphynes.</p>

            <p>The ability to control magnetic interactions at the nanoscale is crucial for the development of next-generation spintronic devices and functional magnetic materials. In this work, we investigate theoretically, by means of many-body perturbation theory, how interlayer twisting modulates magnetic interactions in bilayer van der Waals systems composed of two ferromagnetic layers. We demonstrate that the relative strengths of the interlayer Heisenberg exchange interaction, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and the anisotropic exchange interaction can be significantly altered by varying the twist angle between the layers, thus leading to tunable magnetic textures. We further show that these interactions are strongly dependent on the chemical potential, enabling additional control via electrostatic gating or doping. Importantly, our approach is applicable to arbitrary twist angles and does not rely on the construction of a Moiré supercell, making it particularly efficient even at small twist angles.</p>

            <p>Superconducting thin films with high intrinsic kinetic inductance $L_{k}$ are important for high-sensitivity detectors, enabling strong coupling in hybrid quantum systems, and enhancing nonlinearities in quantum devices. We report the room-temperature reactive sputtering of titanium nitride thin films with a critical temperature $T_{c}$ of \SI{3.8}{K} and a thickness of \SI{27}{nm}. Fabricated into resonators, these films exhibit a sheet kinetic inductance $L_{k, \square}$ of 394~$\textrm{pH}/\square$, as inferred from resonant frequency measurements. %from this film and measure quality factors of $4\times 10^{4}$; these quality factors are likely limited by the low resistivity wafer. X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the formation of stoichiometric TiN, with no residual unreacted titanium. The films also demonstrate a characteristic sheet resistivity of 475~$\Omega/\square$, yielding an impedance an order of magnitude higher than conventional 50~$\Omega$ resonators. This property could enhance microwave single\textendash photon coupling strength by an order of magnitude, offering transformative potential for hybrid quantum systems and quantum sensing. Furthermore, the high $L_{k}$ enables Kerr nonlinearities comparable to state\textendash of\textendash the\textendash art quantum devices. Combined with its relatively high $T_{c}$, this thin film presents a promising platform for superconducting devices, including amplifiers and qubits operating at higher temperatures.</p>

            <p>We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.</p>

            <p>In indirect band gap materials, phonon-assisted processes are key mechanisms for photoluminescence (PL). Using a first-principles many-body approach, we systematically investigate the phonon-assisted PL in bilayer MoS$_2$ and its dependence on temperature and external tensile strain. The effects of phonons are accounted for using a supercell approach: we identify the phonon momenta that are important to PL, construct supercells that are commensurate with these phonons, and examine the changes in the optical absorption after explicit displacements of atoms along each phonon mode. The PL intensity is then obtained via the van Roosbroeck-Shockley relationship from the optical absorption spectra. This approach enables us to investigate phonon-absorption and phonon-emission processes separately and how each process depends on temperature. Our results reveal that optical phonons associated with out-of-plane vibrations of S atoms and in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms contribute most to the indirect PL for unstrained bilayer MoS$_2$. Additionally, we also discuss how the PL spectra and the phonon contributions evolve with strain. In particular, we show that at high strain, additional phonon channels become available due to the modulation of the electronic band structure.</p>

            <p>We report the discovery of a thermodynamically stable skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice in two-dimensional heterostructures, a novel state exhibiting a net-zero global topological charge owing to an equal population of skyrmions and antiskyrmions. This surprising coexistence of oppositely charged solitons remarkably circumvents their anticipated annihilation. We demonstrate the formation and evolution of this phase in Fe films on C1v -symmetric (110) surfaces of GaAs and CdTe semiconductors. Specifically, we reveal a series of magnetic field-induced phase transitions: cycloidal spin-spiral to skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice to conical spin-spiral to ferromagnet. The remarkable stability of the net-zero lattice is attributed to symmetry-enforced anisotropic magnetic interactions. Lowering interfacial symmetry to C1v thus enables frustrated chiral magnets, uniquely manifesting in thermodynamically stable net-zero topological soliton lattices, as revealed by our findings.</p>

            <h2>Potential renormalisation, Lamb shift and mean-force Gibbs state -- to shift or not to shift?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis A. Correa, Jonas Glatthard</p>
            <p>Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is, in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can yield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system folklore regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified.</p>
