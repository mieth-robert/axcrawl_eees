            <h2>Interacting electrons in silicon quantum interconnects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anantha S. Rao, Christopher David White, Sean R. Muleady, Anthony Sigillito, Michael J. Gullans</p>
            <p>Coherent interconnects between gate-defined silicon quantum processing units are essential for scalable quantum computation and long-range entanglement. We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits. Our results position silicon interconnects as a platform for studying Luttinger liquid physics and for enabling architectures supporting nonlocal quantum error correction and quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Emission Dynamics of Rydberg Excitons in $\mathbf{\mathrm{Cu_2O}}$: Distinguishing Second Harmonic Generation from Secondary Emission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kerwan Morin, Poulab Chakrabarti, Delphine Lagarde, Maxime Mauguet, Sylwia Zielińska - Raczyńska, David Ziemkiewicz, Xavier Marie, Thomas Boulier</p>
            <p>Rydberg excitons in $\mathrm{Cu_2O}$ simultaneously give rise to two very different optical responses under resonant two-photon excitation: a coherent second-harmonic signal mediated by the excitonic second order susceptibility tensor $\chi^{(2)}$, and a secondary emission originating from the radiative decay of real exciton populations. Distinguishing these two channels is essential for interpreting nonlinear and quantum-optical experiments based on high-$n$ states, yet their temporal, spectral, and power-dependent signatures often overlap. Here we use time-resolved resonant two-photon excitation to cleanly separate SHG and SE and to map how each depends on $n$, temperature, excitation power, and crystal quality. This approach reveals the markedly different sensitivities of the two processes to phonons, defects, and many-body effects, and establishes practical criteria for identifying SE and SHG in a wide range of experimental conditions. Our results provide a unified framework for interpreting emission from Rydberg excitons and offer guidelines for future studies aiming to exploit their nonlinear response and long-range interactions.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic switching of exciton lifetime in CrSBr</h2>

Mayoh, Geetha Balakrishnan, Muthumalai Karuppasamy, Zdeněk Sofer, Yadong Wang, Daniel J. Gillard, Xuerong Hu, Alexander I. Tartakovskii, Manfred Bayer</p>
            <p>Exciton dynamics in layered magnetic semiconductors provide a sensitive probe of the interplay between spin order and light-matter interaction. Here, we study thin CrSBr layers using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in an external magnetic field, revealing a step-like reduction in the exciton lifetime from 11 to 7 ps, during the magnetization flip from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. The reduction of the exciton lifetime in the ferromagnetic phase persists below the Néel temperature, as evidenced by its strong magnetic-field dependence that disappears in the paramagnetic phase. Ab initio calculations reveal a one-dimensional nature of free excitons accompanied by a pronounced change in the oscillator strength across the magnetic phase transition predicting a shorter radiative lifetime of free excitons in the antiferromagnetic phase of CrSBr contradicting the experimental observations. This discrepancy is explained by strong localization of excitons at low tempature. We show both experimentally and theoretically that the observed magnetic switching of the exciton lifetime is attributed to a larger exciton localization volume leading to a larger oscillator strength in the ferromagnetic phase. The results show that disorder-induced localization effects play a key role in exciton dynamics in CrSBr.</p>

            <h2>Multi-resonant non-dispersive infrared gas sensing: breaking the selectivity and sensitivity tradeoff</h2>

            <p>In applications such as atmospheric monitoring of greenhouse gases and pollutants, the detection and identification of trace concentrations of harmful gases is commonly achieved using non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors. These devices employ a broadband infrared emitter, thermopile detector, and a spectrally selective bandpass filter tuned to the vibrational resonance of the target analyte. However, the fabrication of these filters is costly and limited to a single frequency. This limitation introduces a fundamental tradeoff, as broadening the optical passband width enhances sensitivity but compromises selectivity, whereas narrowing improves selectivity at the expense of sensitivity. In this work, we validate a filterless NDIR approach using a multi-peak thermal emitter developed through inverse design. This emitter enhances detection sensitivity by targeting multiple absorption bands, demonstrated through the creation of a sensor designed for the C-H vibrational modes of propane. Additionally, a set of single-peak emitters were developed to showcase the capability of designing highly selective sensors operating within close spectral proximity. These emitters, targeting the stretching modes of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, exhibit Q-factors above 50 and minimal crosstalk, enabling accurate detection of the target gas without interference from gases with spectrally adjacent absorption bands. This is enabled by the implementation of an aperiodic distributed Bragg reflectors, which allows for higher Q-factors with fewer layers than a periodic Bragg reflector using the same materials and number of layers, thereby reducing fabrication complexity and cost. Experimental results validate that this approach breaks the tradeoff between sensitivity and selectivity. This work highlights the potential of optimized thermal emitters for more efficient and compact gas sensing applications.</p>

            <h2>Coupled Spin-lattice Dynamics across a Magnetostructural Phase Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lokanath Patra, Zeyu Xiang, Yubi Chen, Bolin Liao</p>
            <p>First-order magnetostructural phase transitions underpin giant magnetocaloric effects, yet the microscopic role of lattice dynamics in these transitions remains controversial. Here we use first-principles spin-lattice dynamics simulations to investigate the coupled evolution of magnetization and phonon dispersions across the magnetostructural transition in MnAs. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimentally observed Curie temperature, lattice contraction, and free-energy crossing between hexagonal and orthorhombic phases. We show that below the Curie temperature, magnetic-field-induced hardening of soft phonon modes gives rise to a sizable lattice entropy contribution that enhances the total isothermal entropy change by approximately 23% under a 5 T field. In contrast, the lattice entropy change associated with the structural phase transition itself has an opposite sign and partially compensates the lattice contribution due to field-induced phonon hardening. This competition reconciles long-standing discrepancies in the interpretation of magnetocaloric entropy measurements across first-order transitions. In addition, we demonstrate that the strong magnetic-field dependence of the phonon spectrum near the transition enables large tunability of lattice thermal conductivity, highlighting MnAs as a promising platform for magnetic-field-controlled thermal switching. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of spin-lattice coupling in first-order magnetocaloric materials and provide design principles for engineering enhanced caloric and thermal transport functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Cross-hatch strain effects on SiGe quantum dots for qubit variability estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Fabián Peña, Mitchell I. Brickson, Fabrizio Rovaris, J. Houston Dycus, Anthony McDonald, Zachary T. Piontkowski, Joel Benjamin Ruzindana, Adelaide M. Bradicich, Don Bethke, Robin Scott, Thomas E. Beechem, Francesco Montalenti, N. Tobias Jacobson, Ezra Bussmann</p>
            <p>SiGe heterostructures integrated with Si via virtual substrate (VS) growth are promising hosts for spin qubits. While VS growth targets plastic relaxation, residual cross-hatch strain inhomogeneity propagates into heterostructure overgrowth. To quantify strain inhomogeneity's influence on interface structure and qubit properties, we measure strained-silicon (s-Si)/Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ heterostructures on 25 wafers processed via standard commercial chemical vapor deposition. Spatially-aligned images of strain (Raman microscopy) and interface structure (atomic force microscopy and cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy) reveal strain-roughness interplay. A strain-driven surface diffusion model predicts the roughness and its temperature dependence. Measured strains suggest spurious double-dot qubit detunings of 0.1 meV over 100 nm distances may result. Modeling shows that interface roughness (atomic steps), when convolved with alloy disorder, only modestly reduces valley splitting (70$\pm$13 vs. 77$\pm$14 $\mu$eV on average). Our findings point to thicker VS buffer layers beneath heterostructures and lower-temperature growth (T $\le$ 700 $^{\circ}$C) to limit roughening.</p>

            <h2>Molecular Orbital Degeneracy Lifting in a Tetrahedral Cluster System NbSeI</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Kojima, Youichi Yamakawa, Ryutaro Okuma, Shunsuke Kitou, Hayato Takano, Jun-ichi Yamaura, Yusuke Tokunaga, Taka-hisa Arima, Yoshihiko Okamoto</p>
            <p>The lifting of degenerate electronic states, in which multiple electronic states share the same energy, is a fundamental issue in the physics of crystalline solids. In real materials, this problem has been extensively studied in transition metal compounds, where various quantum phenomena arise from the spin and orbital degeneracy of the d electrons on individual transition-metal atoms. In contrast, materials containing high-symmetry clusters composed of multiple transition-metal atoms are expected to exhibit more emergent phenomena due to the entanglement of the electronic degrees of freedom across multiple atoms. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct mechanisms of orbital-degeneracy lifting in NbSeI, which comprises Nb4 tetrahedral clusters with molecular orbital degrees of freedom and whose average crystal structure is predicted to host a flat-band metal. Below 106 K, NbSeI is found to be a nonmagnetic molecular orbital-ordered insulator. Above this temperature, the average structure becomes face-centered cubic without any superlattice, while the orbital degeneracy remains lifted by significant local distortions of Nb4 tetrahedra, which may be associated with a molecular orbital-liquid or orbital-frozen state. This noncooperative Jahn-Teller distortion stabilizes a nonmagnetic insulating state above 106 K, in stark contrast to the flat-band metal predicted from the average structure.</p>

            <h2>Topological Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Heterostructures on a Honeycomb Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> George McArdle, Brian Kiraly, Peter Wadley, Adam Gammon-Smith</p>
            <p>Altermagnet-superconductor heterostructures have been shown, in principle, to provide a route towards realising topological superconductivity, and therefore host topologically protected boundary states. In this work we demonstrate that the topological states observed are dependent on the structure of the underlying lattice. By deriving and analysing a model on a honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate that the topological phase diagram has a rich structure containing both chiral edge modes and Majorana corner modes, the latter of which are an indication of higher-order topology. We analyse the effect of disorder on these states and find that whilst the edge modes are robust to a disordered system, any potential observation of the corner modes may be sensitive to the microscopic details. In particular, we show that vacancies can lead to other low energy bound states that may be difficult to distinguish from the corner modes.</p>

            <h2>First-principles analysis of in-plane anomalous Hall effect using symmetry-adapted Wannier Hamiltonians and multipole decomposition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroto Saito, Takashi Koretsune</p>
            <p>The in-plane anomalous Hall effect occurs when magnetization lies within the same plane as the electric field and Hall current, and requires magnetic point groups lacking rotational or mirror symmetries. While it is observed in both Weyl semimetals and elemental ferromagnets, the microscopic role of higher-order multipoles remains unclear. Here, we develop a microscopic framework that combines time-reversal-symmetric Wannier functions with a symmetry-adapted multipole basis to decompose the first-principles Wannier Hamiltonian into electric, magnetic, magnetic toroidal, and electric toroidal multipoles. This approach allows us to rotate the magnetization rank by rank and quantify how each multipole affects the conductivity. Applying this framework to body-centered cubic iron, we find that high-rank magnetic and magnetic toroidal multipoles contribute with magnitudes comparable to magnetic dipoles, while magnetic toroidal 16-poles act with the opposite sign. Furthermore, based on this multipole analysis, we apply uniaxial strain along the [103] direction to control the dominant multipoles contributing to the conductivity. The strain substantially modifies its angular dependence, demonstrating that multipole-resolved Hamiltonian engineering and magnetoelastic control serve as practical routes to predict and tune the in-plane anomalous Hall conductivity in simple ferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Quantized heat flow in the Hofstadter butterfly</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aifei Zhang, Gibril Aissani, Quan Dong, Yong Jin, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Carles Altimiras, Patrice Roche, Jean-Marc Berroir, Emmanuel Baudin, Gwendal Fève, Gerbold Ménard, Olivier Maillet, François D. Parmentier</p>
            <p>When subjected to a strong magnetic field, electrons on a two-dimensional lattice acquire a fractal energy spectrum called Hofstadter's butterfly. In addition to its unique recursive structure, the Hofstadter butterfly is intimately linked to non-trivial topological orders, hosting a cascade of ground states characterized by non-zero topological invariants. These states, called Chern insulators, are usually understood as replicas of the ground states of the quantum Hall effect, with electrical and thermal conductances that should be quantized, reflecting their topological order. The Hofstadter butterfly is now commonly observed in van-der-Waals heterostructures-based moiré superlattices. However, its thermal properties, particularly the quantized heat flow expected in the Chern insulators, have not been investigated, potentially questioning their similarity with standard quantum Hall states. Here we probe the heat transport properties of the Hofstadter butterfly, obtained in a graphene~/~hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattice. We observe a quantized heat flow, uniquely set by the topological invariant, for all investigated states of the Hofstadter butterfly: quantum Hall states, Chern insulators, and even symmetry-broken Chern insulators emerging from strong electronic interactions. Our work firmly establishes the universality of the quantization of heat transport and its intimate link with topology.</p>

            <h2>Mechanical control of magnetic exchange and response in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$: A computational study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sagar Sarkar, Rohit Pathak, Arnob Mukherjee, Anna Delin, Olle Eriksson, Vladislav Borisov</p>
            <p>We present a systematic computational study of the effect of uniaxial strain on the magnetic properties of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, a centrosymmetric material known to host a field-induced skyrmion lattice (SkL). Using first-principles density functional theory, we first demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the exchange and anisotropy to specific structural distortions. These DFT-derived interactions are then integrated into a classical spin model to construct comprehensive magnetic phase diagrams under both compressive and tensile strain. Our key finding is that compressive strain ($\sim 2\%$) acts as an effective tuning parameter, substantially expanding the stability region of the $\vec Q_{100}$-driven topologically nontrivial phases. This results from the shifts in the critical magnetic fields and enhancement of the energy scale of the favored magnetic wave vector. In contrast, tensile strain induces a different magnetic ground-state by promoting a different magnetic ordering vector, $\vec Q_{110}$, leading to entirely distinct phase behavior. This work not only provides a quantitative understanding of the structural-magnetic coupling in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ but also establishes strain engineering as a powerful approach to control and optimize topologically non-trivial magnetic phases in centrosymmetric magnets.</p>

            <h2>Spin dynamics of excitons and carriers in mixed-cation MA$_{x}$FA$_{1-x}$PbI$_{3}$ perovskite crystals: alloy fluctuations probed by optical orientation</h2>

            <p>Optical spin orientation measured by time-resolved photoluminescence provides a powerful tool to probe the spin dynamics of excitons and charge carriers in perovskite semiconductors. The impact of alloy fluctuations on the spin dynamics of mixed-cation \MAFAPI{} perovskite single crystals is studied here experimentally. The optical orientation is measured under nonresonant excitation for crystals with $x = 0.1$, $0.4$, and $0.8$ at cryogenic temperatures and compared with data on \MAPI{} crystals. The high degree of exciton optical orientation of $75-80$\% for $x = 0.1$ and $0.8$ reduces to about 60\% for $x = 0.4$. A similar trend is observed for the carrier spin optical orientation. This behavior is attributed to enhanced scattering of free excitons and carriers in the alloys with increased compositional and structural disorder. From the Larmor spin precession measured from spin dynamics in an external magnetic field applied in the Voigt geometry, the electron and hole $g$-factors are evaluated. Their dependence on the band gap energy in \MAFAPI{} crystals follows the universal trend previously established for lead halide perovskites.</p>

            <h2>Crystalline-dependent magnon torques in all-sputtered Hf/Cr2O3/ferromagnet heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Pu, Guoyi Shi, Chenhui Zhang, Xinhou Chen, Hanbum Park, Hyunsoo Yang</p>
            <p>Electron motion in spin-orbit torque devices inevitably leads to the Joule heating issue. Magnon torques can potentially circumvent this issue, as it enables the transport of spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials. In this work, we fabricate a sandwich structure composed of Hf/antiferromagnetic Cr2O3/ferromagnet and demonstrate that the magnon torque is strongly dependent on the crystalline structure of Cr2O3. Magnon torques are stronger when the Neel vector of Cr2O3 aligns parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf, while they are suppressed when the Neel vector is perpendicular to the spin polarization. The magnon torque efficiency is estimated to be -0.134 using in-plane second harmonic Hall measurements. Using magnon torques, we achieve perpendicular magnetization switching of CoFeB, with a critical switching current density of 4.09 x 10^7 A/cm^2. Furthermore, the spin angular momentum loss due to the insertion of Cr2O3 is found to be lower than that of polycrystalline NiO. Our work highlights the role of antiferromagnet crystalline structures in controlling magnon torques, broadening the potential applications of magnon torques.</p>

            <h2>Phonon-induced Markovian and non-Markovian effects on absorption spectra of moiré excitons in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Groll, Anton Plonka, Kevin Jürgens, Daniel Wigger, Tilmann Kuhn</p>
            <p>The properties of moiré excitons in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) vary significantly with the twist angle, ranging from quasi localized excitons with flat dispersions for small twist angles to delocalized excitons for larger ones. This twist angle dependence directly impacts the exciton-phonon coupling, which plays a significant role for the optical properties of these materials. In this work we theoretically investigate the twist angle dependent influence of phonons on absorption spectra of intralayer moiré excitons in a twisted TMDC hetero-bilayer. For the lowest-lying intralayer moiré exciton we find that the exciton-phonon coupling interpolates between two physically distinct regimes when tuning the twist angle. At small twist angles non-Markovian polarization dynamics and phonon sidebands dominate the properties of absorption spectra for localized excitons. For larger twist angles Markovian processes become more important leading to additional line broadening. Furthermore, the absorption spectra here show a characteristic asymmetric peak similar to monolayer TMDCs. When taking into account multiple bright moiré exciton bands we find that intraband scattering due to optical phonons has a significant impact on absorption spectra, effectively suppressing absorption peaks of higher lying bands when their bandwidth surpasses the optical phonon energy.</p>

            <p>Noncollinear spin structures have attracted tremendous attention because they offer a versatile platform for spin control and manipulation, essential in spintronics. Realizing noncollinearity in ferrimagnetic insulators is of particular interest as they can be potentially utilized in low-damping spintronics with tunable magnetic order. Within the spinel-ferrite family, Zn and Al-substituted nickel ferrite (NiZAF) has emerged as an excellent choice for low-damping spintronics. However, realizing noncollinearity in such systems remains challenging. Here, we present evidence of noncollinear spin structure in the NiZAF thin films induced by the rare earth Dy-doping, utilizing the soft x-ray spectroscopy methods such as magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity (XRMR). In particular, XRMR reveals a spiral-type spin structure, which is attributed to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, arising due to broken inversion symmetry by the Dy-induced local strain field as confirmed by our theoretical calculations. The realization of noncollinearity in the spinel-ferrite opens pathway to explore the possibility of chiral magnetic domains and topological spin textures exhibiting promise for oxide-based spintronics</p>

            <h2>Reservoir computing from collective dynamics of active colloidal oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veit-Lorenz Heuthe, Lukas Seemann, Samuel Tovey, Clemens Bechinger</p>
            <p>Physical reservoir computing is a computational framework that offers an energy- and computation-efficient alternative to conventional training of neural networks. In reservoir computing, input signals are mapped into the high-dimensional dynamics of a nonlinear system, and only a simple readout layer is trained. In most physical implementations, the interactions that give rise to the dynamics cannot be tuned directly and high dimensionality is typically achieved through time-multiplexing, which can limit flexibility and efficiency. Here we introduce a reservoir composed of hundreds of hydrodynamically coupled active colloidal oscillators forming a fully parallel physical reservoir and whose coupling strength and fading-memory time can be tuned in situ. The collective dynamics of the active oscillators allow accurate predictions of chaotic time series from single reservoir readouts without time-multiplexing. We further demonstrate real-time detection of subtle hidden anomalies that preserve all instantaneous statistical properties of the signal yet disrupt its underlying temporal correlations. These results establish interacting active colloids as a reconfigurable platform for physical computation and edge-integrated intelligent sensing for model-free detection of irregularities in complex time signals.</p>

            <p>A pair of quantized spin-wave modes is driven by two-tone parallel pumping in a YIG microdisk. The nonlinear dynamics is experimentally investigated by probing the resulting steady state, which is found to critically depend on the chosen pair of modes, the detuning between the pump frequencies and the modes parametric resonance, as well as the temporal sequence of the two rf tones. A general theory of parametric excitation in confined structures based on magnetization normal modes is developed and quantitatively accounts for the observed dependence and non-commutative behaviors, which emerge from the interplay between the self and mutual nonlinear frequency shifts of the spin-wave modes. Owing to its high degree of external controllability and scalability to larger sets of modes, this dynamical system provides a model platform for exploring nonlinear phenomena and a promising route toward rf driven state mapping relevant to neuromorphic and unconventional computing.</p>

            <p>Spintronics has emerged as a promising field for next-generation devices, offering functionalities beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS). A critical challenge in spintronics is to develop systems that can efficiently generate spin currents and enable their long-distance transport. Here, we demonstrate a graphene (Gr)/heavy metal (HM) heterostructure system that combines strong charge-spin interconversion efficiency, induced by the spin Hall effect, with a long spin diffusion length. By employing an industry-friendly magnetron sputtering technique, we deposit HM layers onto few-layer Gr while minimizing structural damage. The proximity effect from the HM enhances the spin Hall angle of Gr while limiting the reduction in its spin diffusion length. Additionally, the spin Hall angle can be tuned via an applied gate voltage, offering high controllability of the system. Importantly, these properties are observed across heterostructures composed of different HMs, indicating the generality of this approach. Our findings establish Gr/HM heterostructures as a scalable and versatile platform for spin current generation, paving the way for advanced spintronic devices with high efficiency, long spin propagation, and straightforward fabrication processes.</p>

            <p>Electrospun poly(\epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)nanofibrous mats are widely considered for blood-contacting wound dressings and small-diameter vascular applications; however, their intrinsic hydrophobicity limits rapid wetting and controlled interaction with blood. In this work, we modulate the interfacial response of PCL nanofibers by incorporating oxide-shelled silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid, a ligand-free approach that avoids organic stabilizers and preserves surface reactivity. Two composite architectures were designed: SiNPs embedded within the fiber bulk (PAC1,4,16) and SiNPs preferentially exposed at the fiber surface (SPAC1,4,16), with systematically increasing nanoparticle loadings. Structural characterization confirmed the retention of a homogeneous fibrous morphology and the targeted nanoparticle distribution. The dynamic interaction with whole blood was quantified using time-resolved contact-angle measurements, complemented by top-view optical microscopy and three-dimensional profilometry of dried droplets. Pristine PCL remained strongly hydrophobic whereas a hydrophilic PCL functionalized with APTES showed rapid spreading. Incorporation of SiNPs within the fiber volume led to only a moderate enhancement of wettability, and dried droplets retained compact morphologies with limited spreading. In contrast, surface-decorated mats displayed a sharp, concentration-dependent transition toward highly wettable behavior: for SPAC16, the contact angle fell below 20, droplet profiles became markedly flattened, and microscopy revealed extended plasma-rich regions surrounding a red-cell-rich core, indicative of pronounced phase separation within the nanofibrous network.</p>

            <h2>Cooperative concurrence of 4f and 3d flat bands in kagome heavy-fermion metal YbCr6Ge6</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenxin Lv, Pengcheng Ma, Tianqi Wang, Shangjie Tian, Ying Ma, Shouguo Wang, Xiao Zhang, Zhonghao Liu, Hechang Lei</p>
            <p>Flat-band (FB) systems originating from special lattice geometry like in kagome metals as well as localized orbitals in the materials such as heavy-fermion (HF) compounds have induced intensive interest due to their band topology and strong electron correlation effects, leading to emergent quantum states of matter. However, the question of how these two distinct FBs coexist and interact remains unsettled. Here, we report that YbCr6Ge6 hosting both Cr-kagome lattice and Yb-4f electrons exhibits HF behaviors and a robust antiferromagnetic ground state with transition temperature TN = 3 K, significantly higher than other similar kagome metals with Yb ions. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal the coexistence of FBs originating from both Cr-kagome lattice and localized Yb-4f electrons near Fermi energy level EF. More importantly, the clear spectroscopic signatures of a hybridization of Yb-4f FB with kagome-lattice-derived conduction bands and the high density of states of Cr-kagome FB near EF provide the underlying microscopic mechanisms of HF behaviors and enhanced antiferromagnetism in YbCr6Ge6. Our findings demonstrate that the novel kagome HF metals can not only host the cooperative coexistence of two different types of FBs, but also provide a paradigm material platform to explore the exotic correlated topological quantum phenomena.</p>

            <p>Understanding microstructure in terms of closed-form expressions is an open challenge in nonequilibrium statistical physics. We propose a simple and generic method that combines particle-resolved simulations, deep neural networks and symbolic regression to predict the pair-correlation function of passive and active particles. Our analytical closed-form results closely agree with Brownian dynamics simulations, even at relatively large packing fractions and for strong activity. The proposed method is broadly applicable, computationally efficient, and can be used to enhance the predictive power of nonequilibrium continuum theories and for designing pattern formation.</p>

            <h2>Thermally Configurable Multi-Order Polar Skyrmions in Multiferroic Oxide Superlattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kefan Liu, Yuhui Huang, Xiangwei Guo, Yongjun Wu, Juan Li, Zijian Hong</p>
            <p>Polar topological textures in low-dimensional ferroelectrics have emerged as a versatile platform for high-density information storage and neuromorphic computing. While low-order topological states, such as vortices and skyrmions, have been extensively studied, high-order polar topological families remain largely unexplored due to their higher energy requirements and limited stabilization methods. Here, using a BiFeO3 (BFO)-based multiferroic superlattice as a model system, we demonstrate a thermal-modulation strategy that stabilizes multi-order polar skyrmions and enables reversible tuning of their topological order through phase-field simulations. It was found that temperature modulation drives the system from polar solitons through 1{\pi}-, 2{\pi}-, 3{\pi}-, and 4{\pi}-skyrmion states, with closed heating-cooling path analyses revealing the widest thermal stability window for 2{\pi}-skyrmions (up to 600 K). Leveraging this robustness, 2% Sm doping in BFO lowers the transition temperatures, enabling room-temperature stabilization of 2{\pi}-skyrmions. These findings enrich the fundamental understanding of multi-order polar topologies and establish a tunable strategy for realizing variable-order topological configurations in practical memory devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan-Na Liu, Jun Zheng, Pierre A. Pantaleon</p>
            <p>We study ballistic electron transport through electrostatic barriers in AB-stacked bilayer graphene within a full four-band framework. A mode-resolved analysis reveals how propagating and evanescent channels couple across electrostatic interfaces and how channel selectivity governs transport at normal incidence. We show that, even when decoupled channels remain inactive, perfect transmission can occur at discrete energies due to phase matching of a single internal mode within an individual barrier. This effect is interpreted as a ghost quantum well, namely an effective cavity formed by internal phase coherence inside the barrier, without true bound states and without restoring coupling to decoupled channels. For single- and double-barrier geometries, we derive compact analytical expressions for the transmission and identify the corresponding resonance conditions. Extending the analysis to multibarrier structures using a transfer-matrix approach, we demonstrate how perfect resonances driven by internal phase matching coexist with Fabry-Perot-like resonances arising from inter-barrier interference. Our results provide a unified, channel-resolved description of tunnelling suppression and resonance-assisted transport in bilayer graphene barrier systems.</p>

            <h2>Slow mixing and emergent one-form symmetries in three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles Stahl, Benedikt Placke, Vedika Khemani, Yaodong Li</p>
            <p>Symmetry-breaking order at low temperatures is often accompanied by slow relaxation dynamics, due to diverging free-energy barriers arising from interfaces between different ordered states. Here, we extend this correspondence to classical topological order, where the ordered states are locally indistinguishable, so there is no notion of interfaces between them. We study the relaxation dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) as a canonical example. We prove a lower bound on the mixing time in the deconfined phase, $t_{\text{mix}} = \exp [\Omega(L)]$, where L is the linear system size. This bound applies even in the presence of perturbations that explicitly break the one-form symmetry between different long-lived states. This perturbation destroys the energy barriers between ordered states, but we show that entropic effects nevertheless lead to diverging free-energy barriers at nonzero temperature. Our proof establishes the LGT as a robust finite-temperature classical memory. We further prove that entropic effects lead to an emergent one-form symmetry, via a notion that we make precise. We argue that the exponential mixing time follows from universal properties of the deconfined phase, and numerically corroborate this expectation by exploring mixing time scales at the Higgs and confinement transitions out of the deconfined phase. These transitions are found to exhibit markedly different dynamic scaling, even though both have the static critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. We expect this novel entropic mechanism for memory and emergent symmetry to also bring insight into self-correcting quantum memories.</p>

            <h2>Autonomous Sampling and SHAP Interpretation of Deposition-Rates in Bipolar HiPIMS</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Wieczorek, Nathan Rodkey, Jan Sommerhäuser, Jason Hattrick-Simpers, Sebastian Siol</p>
            <p>High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) offers considerable control over ion energy and flux, making it invaluable for tailoring the microstructure and properties of advanced functional coatings. However, compared to conventional sputtering techniques, HiPIMS suffers from reduced deposition rates. Many groups have begun to evaluate complex pulsing schemes to improve upon this, leveraging multi-pulse schemes (e.g. pre-ionization or bipolar pulses). Unfortunately, the increased complexity of these pulsing schemes has led to high-dimensionality parameter spaces that are prohibitive to classic design of experi-ments. In this work we evaluate bipolar HiPIMS pulses for improving deposition rates of Al and Ti sputter tar-gets. Over 3000 process conditions were collected via autonomous Bayesian sampling over a 6-dimensional parameter space. These process conditions were then interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to deconvolute complex process influences on deposition rates. This allows us to link observed var-iations in deposition rate to physical mechanisms such as back-attraction and plasma ignition. Insights gained from this approach were then used to target specific processes where the positive pulse components were expected to have the highest impact on deposition rates. However, in practice, only minimal improve-ments in deposition rate were achieved. In most cases, the positive pulse appears to be detrimental when placed immediately after the neg. pulse which we hypothesize relates to quenching of the afterglow plasma. The proposed workflow combining autonomous experimentation and interpretable machine learning is broad-ly applicable to the discovery and optimization of complex plasma processes, paving the way for physics-informed, data-driven advancements in coating technologies.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of the 2nd Law in an Exactly Solvable Model of a Quantum Wire</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco A. Jimenez-Valencia, Charles A. Stafford</p>
            <p>As remarked by Boltzmann, the Second Law of Thermodynamics is notable for the fact that it is readily proved using elementary statistical arguments, but becomes harder and harder to verify the more precise the microscopic description of a system. In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles.</p>

            <p>We investigate thermalization and the quantum-classical correspondence in the fully-connected Bose-Hubbard model, focusing on the four-site case. Our analysis of the classical phase-space structure and its excited-state quantum phase transitions leads us to three dynamical regimes: symmetry-breaking low-energy states, an intermediate region where quantum and classical equilibrium states markedly disagree, and a high-energy regime with restored correspondence. The observed classical intermittency above the first excited-state quantum phase transition contrasts with quantum dynamics, which remains trapped in symmetry-breaking sectors despite the existence of a classically connected phase space. This mismatch originates from the population of imbalance-carrying eigenstates and persists even for relatively large number of particles. Our results reveal unexpectedly slow convergence to the classical limit, signaling robust finite-size effects in collective many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the Floquet spectrum of a detuned, driven two-level system and show that it exhibits exact quasienergy crossings when the detuning is an integer multiple of the energy quantum of the driving field. This behavior can be explained by a hidden time-nonlocal parity, which allows the Floquet modes to be classified as even or odd. Then a generic feature is the emergence of exact crossings between quasienergies of different parity. A constructive proof of the existence of the symmetry is based on a scalar recurrence relation. Moreover, we present a general scheme for its numerical computation, which can be applied to models beyond the two-level system. Analytical results are illustrated with numerical data.</p>

            <p>Oscillatory biochemical signals and mechanical forces must coordinate robustly during development, yet the principles governing their mutual coupling remain poorly understood. In syncytial embryos and cell-free extracts, mitotic waves propagate across millimeter scales while simultaneously generating cytoplasmic flows, suggesting a two-way interaction between chemical oscillators and mechanics. Here, we combine experiments in Xenopus Laevis cytoplasmic extracts with a minimal particle-based model to reveal a mechanochemical feedback that stabilizes phase wave propagation. In contrast to previous models of oscillatory active matter, an asymmetric size cycle, slow growth and rapid shrinkage, combined with size-dependent mechanical interactions generates a net particle displacement and flows aligned with the wave direction, which in turn drive a synchronization transition. Our results show that mechanical forces actively maintain the coherence of biochemical waves, providing a general mechanism for long-range order in oscillating active matter.</p>

In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a network of qubits where each edge corresponds to an independent two-qubit interaction.

We show that the interplay between unitary evolution and spatially correlated disorder leads to a non-standard percolation phenomenology, significantly richer than uniform bond percolation and featuring hysteresis. A two-colour correlated bond percolation model, whose phase diagram is determined via numerical simulations and a mean-field theory, fully elucidates the physics behind this phenomenon.</p>

            <p>We show that under compressive uniaxial deformation of the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, the Dirac cones move toward each other, merge, and a gap opens, while the flat band remains unchanged. Consequently, the low-energy spectrum transitions from linear to quadratic dispersion, indicating the shift from massless to massive Dirac particles. Here, we theoretically investigate the tunneling properties of particles through a sharp $np$ junction in a deformed $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, focusing on the case where the particle energy is half the junction height. We show that this transition from massless to massive particles leads to a change from omnidirectional total transmission, known as super-Klein tunneling, to omnidirectional total reflection, referred to as anti-super-Klein tunneling, in the case of the dice lattice ($\alpha=1$). For all values of $\alpha$, this transition manifests as a change from conventional Klein tunneling to anti-Klein tunneling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. N. Faugno, Tomoki Ozawa</p>
            <p>Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL regime geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary, and the localization parameter as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. First, we demonstrate that the quantum metric can be used to characterize disordered insulating states by applying this theoretical framework to excited states of the 1D Anderson insulator. There we observe that the MBQM and localization parameter are related in finite realizations despite the states being gapless in the thermodynamic limit. Then, we consider a disordered 1D Bose-Hubbard model and find that we can characterize the ergodic-MBL crossover by comparing the MBQM and localization parameter. We find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL regime that characterizes the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured by extracting the quantum metric. Our analysis provides complementary insight into the MBL regime focusing on its insulating properties and providing a localization length whose definition is consistent across a range of insulating phases.</p>

            <p>Topological magnon insulators exhibit robust edge modes with chiral properties similar to quantum Hall edge states. However, due to their strong localization at the edges, interactions between these chiral edge magnons can be significant, as we show in a model of coupled magnon-conserving spin chains in an electric field gradient. The chiral edge modes remain edge-localized and do not scatter into the bulk, and we characterize their scattering phase: for strongly-localized edge modes we observe significant deviation from the bare scattering phase. This renormalization of edge scattering can be attributed to bound bulk modes resonating with the chiral edge magnons, in the spirit of Feshbach resonances in atomic physics. We argue that the scattering dynamics can be probed experimentally with a real-time measurement protocol using inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Our results show that interaction among magnons can be encoded in an effective edge model of reduced dimensionality, where the interactions with the bulk renormalize the effective couplings. Our work introduces a systematic way to determine the many-body effective theory for edge states in topological magnon insulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pok Man Chiu</p>
            <p>Unlike broken time-reversal symmetric (TRS) systems with a defined Chern number, directly measuring the bulk $Z_{2}$ invariant and Berry curvature (if nonzero) in topological insulators and their higher-order topological families remains an unsolved problem. Here, based on the refined trace-determinant inequality (TDI) involving the trace and determinant of the quantum metric and maximal Berry curvature (MBC), we establish an optical bound on the MBC for two-dimensional TRS insulators. By utilizing experimental data on the optical conductivity within a certain energy range, the topological signatures can be identified through the frequency integration of the optical bound. This is supported by the momentum integration of the refined TDI and its $f$-sum rule and topological extension, which provide a topological lower bound. Meanwhile, the decay of optical weight in the topologically trivial region can be controlled by the optical gap and the inverse mass tensor. We illustrate our approach using three representative topological models: the Kane-Mele model, mirror-protected insulator, and quadrupole insulator. Remarkably, we find that the quantized quantum volume (QV) in the mirror-protected insulator results from the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Since QV has a topological lower bound, this suggests that double QV can be interpreted as an upper bound on the number of boundary states. Our findings offer a method for extracting the topological signatures of TRS insulators using optical conductivity data.</p>

            <p>Multiscale modeling, which integrates material properties from ab initio calculations into continuum-scale simulations, is a promising strategy for optimizing semiconductor devices. However, a key challenge remains: while ab initio methods provide diffusion parameters specific to individual migration paths, continuum equations require a single effective set of parameters that captures the overall diffusion behavior. To address this issue, we present VacHopPy, an open-source Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on molecular dynamics (MD). VacHopPy extracts an effective set of hopping parameters, including hopping distance, hopping barrier, number of effective paths, correlation factor, and attempt frequency, by statistically integrating energetic, kinetic, and geometric contributions across all paths. It also includes tools for tracking vacancy trajectories and for detecting phase transitions during MD simulations. The applicability of VacHopPy is demonstrated in three representative materials: face-centered cubic Al, rutile TiO2, and monoclinic HfO2. The extracted effective parameters reproduce temperature-dependent diffusion behavior and are in good agreement with previous experimental data. Provided in a simplified form, these parameters are well suited for continuum-scale models and remain valid over a wide temperature range spanning several hundred kelvins. Furthermore, VacHopPy inherently accounts for anisotropy in thermal vibrations, a factor often overlooked, making it suitable for simulating diffusion in complex crystals. Overall, VacHopPy establishes a robust bridge between atomic- and continuum-scale models, enabling more reliable multiscale simulation</p>

            <p>The morphology of block copolymers (BCPs) critically influences material properties and applications. This work introduces a machine learning (ML)-enabled, high-throughput framework for analyzing grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) data and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images to characterize BCP thin film morphology. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify AFM images by morphology type, achieving 97% testing accuracy. Classified images were then analyzed to extract 2D grain size measurements from the samples in a high-throughput manner. ML models were developed to predict morphological features based on processing parameters such as solvent ratio, additive type, and additive ratio. GISAXS-based properties were predicted with strong performances ($R^2$ > 0.75), while AFM-based property predictions were less accurate ($R^2$ < 0.60), likely due to the localized nature of AFM measurements compared to the bulk information captured by GISAXS. Beyond model performance, interpretability was addressed using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP analysis revealed that the additive ratio had the largest impact on morphological predictions, where additive provides the BCP chains with increased volume to rearrange into thermodynamically favorable morphologies. This interpretability helps validate model predictions and offers insight into parameter importance. Altogether, the presented framework combining high-throughput characterization and interpretable ML offers an approach to exploring and optimizing BCP thin film morphology across a broad processing landscape.</p>

            <p>Band structure unfolding is a key technique for analyzing and simplifying the electronic band structure of large, internally distorted supercells that break the primitive cell's translational symmetry. In this work, we present an efficient band unfolding method for atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that explicitly accounts for both the non-orthogonality of atomic orbitals and their atom-centered nature. Unlike existing approaches that typically rely on a plane-wave representation of the (semi-)valence states, we here derive analytical expressions that recasts the primitive cell translational operator and the associated Bloch-functions in the supercell AO basis. In turn, this enables the accurate and efficient unfolding of conduction, valence, and core states in all-electron codes, as demonstrated by our implementation in the all-electron ab initio simulation package FHI-aims, which employs numeric atom-centered orbitals. We explicitly demonstrate the capability of running large-scale unfolding calculations for systems with thousands of atoms and showcase the importance of this technique for computing temperature-dependent spectral functions in strongly anharmonic materials using CuI as example.</p>

            <p>We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral properties of bosons harmonically confined in a quasi-2D plane and interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. We consider the lowest $100$ energy levels for systems of $N=12, 16$ and $20$ bosons in two distinct regimes: (a) when the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy (moderate interaction) and (b) when the interaction energy is comparable to the trap energy (strong interaction), for the non-rotating ($L_{z}=0$) as well as the rotating single-vortex state ($L_{z}=N$). For higher angular momenta, $L_{z}=2N$ and $L_{z}=3N$, only the strong interaction regime is considered. While the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) $P(s)$ and the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$ are used to study the short-range correlations, the Dyson-Mehta $\Delta_3$ statistic and the level number variance $\Sigma^2(L)$ are used to examine the long-range correlations. In the moderate interaction regime, the non-rotating system exhibits Poisson distribution, a characteristic of the regular energy spectra. In the strong interaction regime, the non-rotating system exhibits chaotic behavior signified by GOE distribution. Furthermore, in the rotating case for the single-vortex state ($L_{z} = N$) in the moderate interaction regime, the system exhibits signatures of weak chaos with some degree of regularity in the energy-level spectra. However, in the strong interaction regime for the rotating case with $L_{z} = N$, $2N$ and $3N$, the system exhibits strong chaotic behavior. The rotation is found to contribute to enhancement of chaotic behavior in the system for both the moderate and the strong interaction regimes. Our results of NNSD analysis are supported by the analysis of the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$, which does not involve unfolding.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the recent observation of giant room-temperature magnon spin conductivity in an ultrathin ferromagnetic insulator [X.-Y. Wei et al., Nat. Mater. 21, 1352 (2022)], we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport in thin antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs). We study the prototypical AFI hematite, known for its exceptionally low magnetic damping and two distinct magnetic phases: a low-temperature uniaxial easy-axis phase and a high-temperature biaxial easy-plane phase. Using stochastic micromagnetic simulations, we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport across both magnetic phases. Our results uncover a crossover from quasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional magnon spin transport at a critical thickness, determined by the frequency or energy of the excited magnons. Below this critical thickness, we observe a pronounced enhancement in the magnon diffusion length in both magnetic phases. This rise is attributed to a change in the effective magnon density of states, reflecting the reduced phase space available for scattering in the thinner, quasi-two-dimensional regime. Understanding and controlling long-distance magnon spin transport in AFIs is crucial for developing next-generation spintronic nanodevices, especially as materials approach the two-dimensional limit.</p>

            <p>Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent: the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michel Orsi, Veeraj Shah, Mahesh Padmanabhan, Thomas Curwen, Jeffrey F. Morris</p>
            <p>We experimentally investigate the rheology of dark chocolate pastes in both industrially relevant pre-refined form and simplified model systems. Steady and oscillatory shear experiments reveal yielding, pronounced shear-thinning, and stress-dependent hysteresis governed by solid loading. Fitting the viscosity data with the Maron-Pierce model provides stress-dependent maximum flowable fractions $\phi_{\rm{m}}(\sigma)$, defining yield loci in the $(\phi, \sigma)$ plane. Their variation with stress quantifies the coupled roles of friction and adhesion in setting flow limits. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear tests characterize transitions from elastic to viscous behavior and identify distinct recovery pathways near jamming. Contact-stress decomposition separates hydrodynamic and frictional contributions, confirming that adhesive contact networks dominate stress transmission in pre-refined pastes. These results establish chocolate pastes as dense, adhesive suspensions whose flow is controlled by the interplay of friction and adhesion, offering quantitative benchmarks for constitutive modeling and linking chocolate processing to the broader physics of constraint rheology.</p>

            <p>Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity once the Zeeman energy exceeds the pairing gap, unless mechanisms such as unconventional pairing, strong spin-orbit coupling, or intrinsic magnetism intervene. Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moiré superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity. These results establish several intriguing new properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in a thick rhombohedral graphene stack.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of a hidden-order phase well below the charge density wave transition in a topological Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I</h2>

            <p>The emergence of a charge density wave (CDW) in a Weyl semimetal -- a correlated topological phase, is exceptionally rare in condensed matter systems. In this context, the quasi-one-dimensional type-III Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I undergoes a CDW transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \approx 263$~K, providing an exceptional platform to investigate correlated topological CDW states. Here, we uncover an additional hidden-order phase transition at $T^* \sim 100$ K, well below the CDW onset, using low-frequency resistance noise spectroscopy, electrical transport, and thermoelectric measurements. This transition is characterized by a sharp enhancement in the noise exponent ($\alpha$) and variance of resistance fluctuations. Analysis of higher-order statistics of resistance fluctuations reveals the correlated dynamics underlying the transition. A pronounced anomaly in the Seebeck coefficient near $T^*$ further suggests a Fermi surface reconstruction. First-principles calculations reveal a structural distortion from the high-symmetry $I422$ phase to a low-symmetry $C2$ phase, via an intermediate $I4$ symmetry. This leads to renormalization of the electronic structure near the Fermi level and opening of a bandgap in the hidden-order phase. These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified correlated phase transition in the topological CDW-Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, enriching the phase diagram of this material and establishing it as an ideal platform for studying intertwined electronic and structural orders.</p>

            <p>Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution < 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian topological superfluidity in a three-dimensional fermi gas with spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pingcheng Zhu, Lihong Zhou, Jianxin Zhong</p>
            <p>The experimental advances in realizing artificial spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and non-Hermitian potentials in ultracold atomic system open a new avenue for exploring their significant roles in quantum many-body physics. Here, we investigate a non-Hermitian, two-component Fermi system in a cubic lattice with Rashba SOC and complex-valued interaction arising from two-body loss. We adopt the non-Hermitian mean field theory and map out the phase diagram at zero temperature. The interplay of dissipation and on-site interaction drives a dissipation-induced phase transition from superfluid (SF) to normal phase (N). Notably, for weak interaction strengths, this leads to a reentrance of the superfluid state. The presence of SOC significantly expands the parameter regime for both the normal phase and the metastable superfluid phase(MSF). Whereas, the Zeeman field can drive the system from a conventional superfluid into a topological superfluid phase(TSF), characterized by a nontrivial topological invariant. These results enrich our knowledge of pairing superfluidity in Fermi systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Cornet, Thierry Deschamps, Sylvie Le Floch, Dominique de Ligny, Christine Martinet</p>
            <p>The structural evolution with temperature of pure silica (SiO2), sodium-silicate (5Na2O-95SiO2, 10Na2O-90SiO2 and 25Na2O-75SiO2) and albite (15Na2O-15Al2O3-75SiO2) glasses previously densified from hot compression is monitored with a combination of small and wide angle x-ray scattering. Transient scattering maxima in the length scales associated with both techniques indicate the presence of a transitory state, suggesting the classification of the initial and final states as distinct glass states in the context of polyamorphism. In all glasses, a transient intensity peak in the small angle scattering is observed, consistent with the nucleation of a new amorphous state. Based on a comparison with the phenomenology observed in supercooled and glassy water, we propose that this structural evolution provide a strong evidence of the glass polyamorphism as the consequence of the existence of an underlying but thermodynamically defined liquid-liquid transition, independent on the polymerization degree of the system.</p>

            <p>Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for the extraction of useful quantum information from quantum devices. Here, we introduce the Subspace Noise Tailoring (SNT) algorithm, which efficiently combines the cheap cost of Symmetry Verification (SV) and low bias of Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) QEM techniques. We study the performance of our method by simulating the Trotterized time evolution of the spin-1/2 Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) using a variety of local fermion-to-qubit encodings, which define a computational subspace through a set of stabilizers, the measurement of which can be used to post-select noisy quantum data. We study different combinations of QEM and encodings and uncover a rich state diagram of optimal combinations, depending on the hardware performance, system size and available shot budget. We then demonstrate how SNT extends the reach of current noisy quantum computers in terms of the number of fermionic lattice sites and the number of Trotter steps, and quantify the required hardware performance beyond which a noisy device may outperform classical computational methods.</p>

            <h2>Machine learning for in-situ composition mapping in a self-driving magnetron sputtering system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanna Jarl, Jens Sjölund, Robert J. W. Frost, Anders Holst, Jonathan J. S. Scragg</p>
            <p>Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks, obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10 experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials exploration.</p>

            <h2>What is emergence, after all?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abbas K. Rizi</p>
            <p>The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</p>

            <p>We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</p>

            <h2>Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruicheng Bao</p>
            <p>Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.</p>

            <p>Critical phenomena have been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally in many fields, such as condensed matter physics, biology, e.g., brain criticality, and cosmology. In particular, the behaviour of response functions right at critical points (CPs) is highly topical. It turns out that in the frame of Boltzmann-Gibbs-von Neumann-Shannon approach, the extensive character of entropy breaks down at CPs. The latter implies diverging susceptibilities, which is at odds with experimental observations. Here, we investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Grüneisen parameter $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ right at CPs for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i}$) for higher $S$, $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii}$) the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii}$) the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv}$) we propose an experimental setup to explore finite-size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ and $S_q$.</p>

            <p>Few-body physics plays a central role in many branches of physics, such as nuclear physics and atomic physics. Advances in controlling ultra-cold quantum gases provide an ideal testbed for few-body physics theory. In this work, we study few-body systems consisting of two distinct species of non-relativistic fermions in one spatial dimension using both field theory and lattice methods. Particles of the same type do not interact with each other, but particles of different types can interact via an attractive contact interaction. We first study the dependence of the coupling of a contact interaction on the lattice spacing. Using this input, we extract two-, three-, and four-body ground state energies in the infinite length limit and benchmark them against the calculations from the continuum field theory. This work enables us to systematically study the effect of discretization and finite-length artifacts on few-body observables.</p>

            <p>The stated overarching goal of the highly active field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP) is to achieve the capability to study \textit{ab-initio} real-time microscopic dynamics of $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, existing experimental realizations and theoretical proposals for future ones have remained restricted to one or two spatial dimensions. Here, we take a big step towards this goal by proposing a concrete experimentally feasible scalable cold-atom quantum simulator of a U$(1)$ quantum link model of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in three spatial dimensions, employing \textit{linear gauge protection} to stabilize gauge invariance. Using tree tensor network simulations, we benchmark the performance of this quantum simulator through near- and far-from-equilibrium observables, showing excellent agreement with the ideal gauge theory. Additionally, we introduce a method for \textit{analog quantum error mitigation} that accounts for unwanted first-order tunneling processes, vastly improving agreement between quantum-simulator and ideal-gauge-theory results. Our findings pave the way towards realistic quantum simulators of $3+1$D lattice gauge theories that can probe regimes well beyond classical simulability.</p>

            <p>Little is known about oxygen-related defects in diamond. Recently, the promising room-temperature spin centre named ST1 was identified as an oxygen centre, but of still unknown atomic structure and thermal stability. In this work, we report on the optically active oxygen-related centres and the conditions for their formation, using ion implantation of oxygen in various conditions of depth and fluence. More specifically, we establish the temperature formation/stability range of the ST1 centre, which has a maximum at about 1100°C and is narrower than for NV centres. In these conditions, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) on small ST1 ensembles was measured with a spin readout contrast of > 20% at 300K. In cathodoluminescence, the 535 nm ST1 peak is not observed. Besides, a broad peak centred at 460 nm is measured for implantation of O$_2$ molecular ions. For an annealing temperature of 1500°C, a different centre is formed (with ZPL at 584.5 nm) with an intensity increasing with a power law 1.5 < p < 1.9 dependence from the implantation fluence. This suggests that this centre contains two oxygen atoms. Besides, a new spectral feature associated to an intrinsic defect was also observed, with four prominent lines (especially at 594nm). Finally, the thermal formation and stability of oxygen centres in diamond presented here are important for the identification of the atomic structure of defects such as the ST1 and possible O$_2$V$_x$ complex by means of ab initio calculations. Indeed, the formation energies and charge states of defect centres are easier to compute than the full energy level scheme, which to date still remains unsuccessful regarding the ST1 centre.</p>

            <p>Spinons are elementary excitations at the core of frustrated quantum magnets. Although it is well-established that a pair of spinons can emerge from a magnon via deconfinement, controlled manipulation of individual spinons and direct observation of their deconfinement remain elusive. We propose an artificial gauge field scenario that enables the engineering of specific excited states in quantum spin models. This generates spatially localized individual spinons with high controllability. By applying time-dependent gauge fields, we realize adiabatic braiding of these spinons, as well as their dynamical evolution in a controllable manner. These results not only provide the first direct visualization of individual spinons localized in the bulk, but also point to new possibilities to simulate their confinement process. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our scenario in Rydberg atoms, which suggests an experimentally viable direction--gauge field engineering of correlated phenomena in excited states.</p>

            <p>Magnons provide a route to ultra-fast transport and non-destructive readout of spin-based information transfer. Here, we report magnon transport and its emergent anisotropic nature in BiFeO$_3$ layers confined between ultrathin layers of the antiferromagnet LaFeO$_3$. Due to the confined state, BiFeO$_3$ serves as an efficient magnon transmission channel as well as a magnetoelectric knob by which to control the stack by means of an electric field. We discuss the mechanism of the anisotropic spin transport based on the interaction between the antiferromagnetic order and the electric field. This allows us to manipulate and amplify the spin transport in such a confined geometry. Furthermore, lower crystal symmetric and suppression of the spin cycloid in ultrathin BiFeO$_3$ stabilizes a non-trivial antiferromagnetic state exhibiting symmetry-protected spin-split bands that provide the non-trivial sign inversion of the spin current, which is a characteristic of an altermagnet. This work provides an understanding of the anisotropic spin transport in complex antiferromagnetic heterostructures where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist, paving the way for a new route to realize electric-field control of a novel state of magnetism.</p>

            <p>Proximity-induced superconductivity at topological insulator-superconductor (TI-SC) interfaces offers a promising route to topological superconductivity with Majorana boundary modes. However, probing the interfacial superconductivity at buried interfaces is challenging with conventional surface methods. Here, we present a theoretical study of the longitudinal optical response of a TI-SC heterostructure, focusing on the complex interface sheet conductance as a direct and layer-selective probe of the interfacial superconducting gap. Within a minimal TI--SC model, we demonstrate that proximity-induced superconductivity at the buried interface generates a two-dimensional topological superconducting phase supporting Majorana edge modes. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes slab model and the Kubo formalism, we compute the optical conductance and introduce a thickness-extrapolation protocol that isolates the interface contribution only. The resulting interface conductance exhibits a robust, thickness-independent coherence peak at an energy set by the proximity-induced gap, distinguishable from both the parent superconductor's pair-breaking feature and the ungapped Dirac cone on the top surface. We further demonstrate that the low-frequency spectral weight of this interface resonance obeys a quantum-metric sum rule, quantitatively linking the optical response to the quantum geometry of the proximitized interfacial state. Our results propose terahertz/infrared spectroscopy of the interfacial sheet conductance as a non-invasive diagnostic of Majorana-hosting TI--SC interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yves Noat, Alain Mauger, William Sacks</p>
            <p>In this article we show that the condensation mechanism in cuprates involves the strong coupling of the condensate to pairon excited states. We present an accessible formalism that significantly extends our previous work, providing a theoretical basis for the energy-dependent gap function $\Delta(E)$. The latter is proportional to the effective spin exchange energy, $J_{eff}$, with no retardation effects, such as the case of spin-fluctuation or phonon mediated couplings. The fundamental parameters of the superconducting (SC) state are the condensation energy per pair, $\beta_c$, and the antinodal energy gap, $\Delta_p$, which are quantitatively extracted by fitting the cuprate quasiparticle spectrum from tunneling experiments. An explicit formula for the critical temperature is also derived in the model. Valid for any doping, we find $T_c$ to be proportional to $\beta_c$, and not the gap $\Delta_p$, in sharp contrast to conventional SC. The numerical factor $\beta_c/k_BT_c\simeq 2.24$ originates from pair excitations of the condensate, following Bose statistics, with a mini-gap $\delta_M \simeq 1\,$meV in the excitation spectrum. These results strongly suggest that the same `all-electron' mechanism is at work all along the $T_c$-dome.</p>

            <p>PdTe has recently been reported to be a type-II Dirac semimetal while a bulk nodal and surface nodeless superconductivity (SC) has been claimed to coexist. In this work, we applied point-contact spectroscopy (PCS) method to systematically study the superconducting gap in PdTe single crystals with a SC transition temperature $T_{c}=4.3$ K. The obtained differential conductance curves show a common deviation from a single-gap superconducting behavior and can be better fitted by a two-gap Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model, suggesting the larger gap $\Delta_{L}$ with $2\Delta_{L}$=3.7 $k_{B}T_{c}$ and the smaller gap $\Delta_S$ yielding $2\Delta_{S}$=1.1-2.2 $k_{B}T_{c}$ with a weak interband scattering. The variations of conductance spectra among different contacts are proposed to be caused by the anisotropy of Fermi surface topology associated with different gaps.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals materials hosting Kitaev interactions are promising platforms for exploring exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we report inelastic neutron scattering investigations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet VBr3, which forms a honeycomb lattice structure at room temperature and exhibits zigzag-type magnetic order below 26.5 K. Our observations reveal distinctive low-energy spin excitations arising from gamma, gamma', and M' points, each featuring a spin gap of around 2.5 meV. The overall spin excitation spectra can be effectively described by a spin Hamiltonian incorporating substantial nearest-neighbor Kitaev and biquadratic interactions, along with Heisenberg interactions. Our findings not only establish VBr3 as a new Kitaev magnet but also suggest that ligand engineering may provide a promising strategy to modulate Kitaev interactions, offering new opportunities for designing Kitaev materials with tailored quantum properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elzbieta Guziewicz, Bronislaw A. Orlowski, Bogdan J. Kowalski</p>
            <p>Manganese-doped tin telluride, Sn(1-x)Mn(x)Te, initially investigated as diluted magnetic semiconductor, has recently attracted considerable attention as a prospective thermoelectric material. The introduction of Mn was found to modify the valence band electronic structure, resulting in an improvement in the Seebeck coefficient and thus, the figure of merit (ZT). In the paper, we present a synchrotron radiation study of the electronic band structure of Sn(0.9)Mn(0.1)Te by resonant photoemission. The contribution of the Mn3d electrons to the valence band (VB), calculated as the difference between the Energy Distribution Curves (EDCs) taken at the maximum and minimum of the Fano resonance for the Mn3p - Mn3d absorption threshold, shows a contribution at the VB edge, a dominant maximum at 4 eV, as well as a wide structure between 7 and 11 eV. Moreover, comparison with undoped SnTe reveals strong renormalization of the Sn5p and Te5p electronic states, which certainly influences the shape of the upper part of the valence band and electron effective mass.</p>

            <h2>A First-principles Study of Weyl Nodal Loop and Multiple Sets of Weyl Points in Trigonal PtBi$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin-Lin Wang</p>
            <p>Coexistence of surface superconductivity and Fermi arcs in trigonal $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ has recently attracted attention for possible realization of topological superconductivity. The Fermi arcs on the two different (0001) surface terminations have been associated with the set of Weyl points just above the Fermi energy (E$_F$). Here using first-principles calculations to explore the band crossings over the full Brillouin zone between the nominally highest valence and lowest conduction bands in $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$, we find a Weyl nodal loop (WNL) and multiple sets of Weyl points (WPs). The main difference between the two reported experimental structural parameters is the magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. While the WNL, bulk gap region and the set of Weyl points just above the E$_F$ are robust, the number and location of the other sets of WPs depend sensitively on the structural parameters with different magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. Besides calculating the 2D Fermi surface with Fermi arcs and quasi-particle interference (QPI) around the E$_F$ in good agreements with ARPES and experimental QPI, we also predict new Fermi arc features at higher energy.</p>

            <p>We investigated the magnetoelastic properties of an YbNi$_4$P$_2$ single crystal at low temperatures under magnetic fields directed along the crystallographic [001] axis. We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity, which is consistent with the cascade of electronic-topological transitions reported previously for this compound. In particular, we identify the vanishing of a small orbit on the Fermi surface, associated with a quantum-oscillation frequency of 34 T. Furthermore, the different transitions are better resolved with acoustic modes of particular symmetry. Using a microscopic model adapted to the strongly correlated electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$, we describe our results by inspecting realistic electron-phonon couplings in reciprocal space for each acoustic mode. This shows how the $k$ selectivity of ultrasound experiments allows to investigate Fermi-surface reconstructions in strongly correlated electronic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Verlage, Peter Kratzer</p>
            <p>The Klein paradox describes an incoming electron being scattered at a supercritical barrier to create electron-positron pairs, a phenomenon widely discussed in textbooks. While demonstrating this phenomenon experimentally with the fundamental particles remains challenging, condensed matter analogs are more accessible to experimental realization. For spinless quasi-particles, theoretical works show an enhancement of the pair production rate, and analogs of this effect in condensed matter systems have been studied theoretically. Here, we present another condensed matter system, a heterostructure comprised of two materials with strongly and weakly interacting electrons, that allows for constructing analytical solutions using the hierarchy-of-correlations method. The results show enhanced electron reflection related with the production of doublon-holon pairs, as known from the Klein paradox.</p>

            <p>Synthetic platforms afford an unparalleled degree of controllability in realizing strongly-correlated phases of matter. In this work, we study the possibility of electrically tunable exciton-mediated superconductivity arising in charge-imbalanced bilayer semiconductors. Focusing on the case of a bilayer semiconductor heterostructure, we identify the gating conditions required to achieve exciton density wave order within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We analyze the role of the coupling of excitonic fluctuations to the fermionic charge carriers to find that the Goldstone mode of the density wave order can mediate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity. Furthermore, when the system is close to the density wave ordering, the interactions mediated by low-energy exciton modes can support an interlayer pair-density wave superconductor of anisotropic character. We discuss experimental signatures associated with these phenomena.</p>

            <p>Time-integrated state observables, which quantify the fraction of time spent by the system in a specific pool of states, are important in many fields, such as chemical sensing or the theory of fluorescence spectroscopy. We derive exact identities, called Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs), that connect the fluctuations of such observables to their response to external perturbations in nonequilibrium steady state of Markov jump processes. Using these results, we derive a first known upper bound on fluctuations of state observables, as well as some new lower bounds. We further demonstrate how our identities provide a deeper understanding of the mechanistic origin of fluctuations and reveal their properties dependent only on system topology, which may be relevant for model inference using measured data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rinske M. Alkemade, Rastko Sknepnek, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion</p>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) strategies are opening the door to faster computer simulations, allowing us to simulate more realistic colloidal systems. Since the interactions in colloidal systems are often highly many-body, stemming from e.g. depletion and steric interactions, one of the challenges for these algorithms is capturing the many-body nature of these interactions. In this paper, we introduce a new ML-based strategy for fitting many-body interactions in colloidal systems where the many-body interaction is highly local. To this end, we develop Voronoi-based descriptors for capturing the local environment and fit the effective potential using a simple neural network. To test this algorithm, we consider a simple two-dimensional model for a colloid-polymer mixture, where the colloid-colloid interactions and colloid-polymer interactions are hard-disk like, while the polymers themselves interact as ideal gas particles. We find that a Voronoi-based description is sufficient to accurately capture the many-body nature of this system. Moreover, we find that the Pearson correlation function alone is insufficient to determine the predictive power of the network emphasizing the importance of additional metrics when assessing the quality of ML-based potentials.</p>

            <h2>Finite Thickness Effects on Metallization Vs. Chiral Majorana Fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Yue, Guo-Jian Qiao, C. P. Sun</p>
            <p>The search for chiral Majorana fermions in quantum anomalous Hall insulator/\textit{s}-wave superconductor heterostructures has attracted intense interest, yet remains controversial due to the lack of conclusive evidence. A key issue is that the heterostructure's metallization can produce half-integer conductance signatures resembling those of chiral Majorana fermions, thereby complicating their identification. In this Letter, we investigate how the competition between metallization and chiral Majorana fermions depends on superconductor thickness, revealing its critical role through three distinct regimes: (i) For thin superconductors ($\sim$10 nm), metallization shows periodic oscillations with thickness, matching the Fermi wavelength. (ii) Intermediate thicknesses ($\sim$100 nm) exhibit periodic windows for observing chiral Majorana fermions. (iii) Thick superconductors ($\sim$1000 nm) sustain stable chiral Majorana fermions that are insensitive to thickness variations. These results suggest that superconductor thickness is a key control parameter for advancing efforts to conclusively identify chiral Majorana fermions.</p>

            <p>Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. To investigate the underlying superfluid dynamics, we employ a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate described by a damped Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an imposed pinning potential that serves as a simplified analogue of a crust. Within this minimal framework, we examine the emergence and evolution of turbulent vortex motion following impulsive perturbations reminiscent of glitch-like forcing. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which can sustain turbulent fluctuations in such a system. By tuning the damping coefficient $\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. While idealized, these findings illustrate how quantum turbulence with multiple scaling regimes can arise in pinned, rotating superfluids, and they suggest possible qualitative connections to vortex-mediated dynamics in neutron stars and other astrophysical superfluid systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rinske M. Alkemade, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion</p>
            <p>Understanding the role that structure plays in the dynamical arrest observed in glassy systems remains an open challenge. Over the last decade, machine learning (ML) strategies have emerged as an important tool for probing this structure-dynamics relationship, particularly for predicting heterogeneous glassy dynamics from local structure. A recent advancement is the introduction of the cage state, a structural quantity that captures the average positions of particles while rearrangements are forbidden. During the caging regime, linear models trained on the cage state have been shown to outperform more complex ML methods trained on initial configurations only. In this paper, we explore the properties associated with the cage state in more detail to better understand why it serves as such an effective predictor for the dynamics. Specifically, we examine how the cage state in a binary hard-sphere mixture is influenced by both packing fraction and boundary conditions. Our results reveal that, as the system approaches the glassy regime, the cage state becomes increasingly influenced by long-range structural effects. This influence is evident both in its predictive power for particle dynamics and in the internal structure of the cage state, suggesting that the CS might be associated with some form of an amorphous growing structural length scale.</p>

            <p>Molecular modeling of thermally activated chemistry in condensed phases is essential to understand polymerization, depolymerization, and other processing steps of molecular materials. Current methods typically combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to describe short-time relaxation with a stochastic description of predetermined chemical reactions. Possible reactions are often selected on the basis of geometric criteria, such as a capture distance between reactive atoms. Although these simulations have provided valuable insight, the approximations used to determine possible reactions often lead to significant molecular strain and unrealistic structures. We show that the local molecular environment surrounding the reactive site plays a crucial role in determining the resulting molecular strain energy and, in turn, the associated reaction rates. We develop a graph neural network capable of predicting the strain energy associated with a cyclization reaction from the pre-reaction, local, molecular environment surrounding the reactive site. The model is trained on a large dataset of condensed-phase reactions during the activation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) obtained from MD simulations and can be used to adjust relative reaction rates in condensed systems and advance our understanding of thermally activated chemical processes in complex materials</p>

            <p>We study bent-core nematic (BCN) systems in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) settings, focusing on the role of cybotactic clusters, phase transitions, confinement effects and applied external fields. We propose a generalised version of Madhusudana's two-state model for BCNs in [Madhusudhana NV, Physical Review E, 96(2), 022710] with two order parameters: $\mathbf{Q}_g$ to describe the ambient ground-state (GS) molecules and $\mathbf{Q}_c$ to describe the additional ordering induced by the cybotactic clusters. The equilibria are modelled by minimisers of an appropriately defined free energy, with an empirical coupling term between $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$. We demonstrate two phase transitions in spatially homogeneous 3D BCN systems at fixed temperatures: a first-order nematic-paranematic transition followed by a paranematic-isotropic phase transition driven by the GS-cluster coupling. We also numerically compute and give heuristic insights into solution landscapes of confined BCN systems on 2D square domains, tailored by the GS-cluster coupling, temperature and external fields. This benchmark example illustrates the potential of this generalised model to capture tunable director profiles, cluster properties and potential biaxiality induced by antagonistic $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$-profiles.</p>

Additionally, boundaries control the relaxation to stationarity, which leads to many new universal scaling functions to explore, both in periodic spin chains and for open chains with magnetization imposed by reservoirs at the ends.</p>

            <p>Understanding the moisture stability of oxide Li-ion conductors is important for their practical applications in solid-state batteries. Unlike sulfide or halide conductors, oxide conductors generally better resist degradation when in contact with water, but can still undergo topotactic \ch{Li+}/\ch{H+} exchange (LHX). Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a machine-learning interatomic potential model to investigate the thermodynamic driving force of the LHX reaction for two representative oxide Li-ion conductor families: garnets and NASICONs. Li-stuffed garnets exhibit a strong driving force for proton exchange due to their high Li chemical potential. In contrast, NASICONs demonstrate a higher resistance against proton exchange due to the lower Li chemical potential and the lower O-H bond covalency for polyanion-bonded oxygens. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: Li stuffing enhances conductivity but increases moisture susceptibility. This study underscores the importance of designing Li-ion conductors that possess both high conductivity and high stability in practical environments.</p>

            <p>To enhance the understanding of the behavior of active nematic, it is important to understand the behavior of topological defects. In this paper, we study the configuration of topological defects of a two-dimensional active nematic around a circular obstacle. In the case of a passive nematic liquid crystal, the equilibrium configuration of defects can be easily identified by the method of image charges. In the case of an active nematic, however, one must take account of the flow field generated by active constituents, and the problem of identifying the defect configuration becomes complicated. We first perform numerical simulations and investigate how the stationary defect configuration deviates from the passive case. Furthermore, we carry out a theoretical calculation based on an analytical expression relating the defect velocity with the force exerted on the defect. Our theoretical calculation qualitatively reproduces the simulation results. Our study may be applied to describing the behaviour of e.g. cell populations in the presence of obstacles, and has the potential to benefit related fields, e.g., developmental biology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Díaz, J. Rodríguez-Fernández, J. Rubio-Zuazo</p>
            <p>Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 19, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Spin Liquids Stabilized by Disorder in Non-Kramers Pyrochlores</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcus V. Marinho, Eric C. Andrade</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of quantum spin liquid phases in pyrochlore oxides with non-Kramers ions, in which structural randomness effectively acts as a transverse field, introducing quantum fluctuations on top of the spin ice manifold. This is contrary to the naive expectation that disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins with their local environment. We study a minimal model for a disordered quantum spin ice, the transverse-field Ising model, using a real-space formulation of the gauge mean-field theory. This approach allows the inclusion of non-perturbative disorder effects exactly, and thus to assess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high fields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. A Griffiths region of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations is restricted to the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the peculiar nature of the low-energy excitations of the problem. For most of the phase diagram, an average description of the disorder captures the physical behavior well, indicating that the inhomogeneous quantum spin ice behaves closely to its homogeneous counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Induced Quasicrystalline Order: Emergence of Quasi-Solid and Quasi-Supersolid Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Zhang</p>
            <p>Deterministic quasiperiodicity in quantum systems has long been associated with localization, criticality, or glassy behavior, and has therefore been believed to suppress long-range order rather than stabilize it. Here we demonstrate the opposite: quasiperiodicity in interactions--without any quasiperiodic potential, disorder, or geometric modulation--can generate coherent, ordered quantum phases. We study hard-core bosons in one dimension with quasiperiodic long-range interactions, V_{ij}=V_0 \cos(\pi \alpha i)\cos(\pi \alpha j), where n=\alpha=(\sqrt{5}-1)/2 is the inverse golden ratio. Using large-scale path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover thermodynamically stable incompressible plateaus at irrational densities tied to Fibonacci ratios. These plateaus exhibit sharp incommensurate Bragg peaks, signaling an emergent quasi-solid with long-range quasicrystalline density order. More strikingly, at nearby fillings and interaction strengths, we identify a quasi-supersolid phase that supports both Fibonacci density ordering and finite superfluid density--demonstrating that interaction-induced quasiperiodicity can stabilize supersolid coherence. Our results establish a new mechanism for realizing ordered quasicrystalline quantum matter, and provide realistic guidance for implementation in Rydberg atom arrays, multimode cavity-QED systems, and trapped-ion quantum simulators.</p>

Additional scattering from spinon continua and bound states appears at higher energies and elsewhere in the Brillouin zone, and could be observed by neutron or X-ray scattering.</p>

            <p>Nonequilibrium phonon transport driven by nanoscale hotspot heating in silicon device layers governs heat dissipation in advanced microelectronics and underscores the need for a better microscopic understanding of such processes. Yet the origin of the frequently observed logarithmic (ln) dependence of the apparent thermal response on hotspot size in crystalline silicon, and the role of individual phonon modes in this regime, remain unclear. Here, we develop a semianalytical, mode-resolved framework in the spectral phonon mean free path (MFP) domain and validate it against a full-phonon-dispersion Boltzmann transport model for heat removal from a 10 x 10 nm^2 hotspot in a thin Si layer (thicknesses of 41, 78, and 177 nm) representative of a silicon-on-insulator transistor. We show that ln-type quasiballistic scaling arises only for modes that lie on a log-uniform conductivity plateau and are diffusive-side or quasiballistic with respect to the hotspot size, whereas fully ballistic long-MFP modes contribute a saturated, nonlogarithmic background, leading to extremely slow suppression of their heat-carrying capability. The resulting phonon-modal nonlocal spectrum establishes spectral selection rules for ln-regime transport in confined Si and provides a compact basis for incorporating mode-selective quasiballistic corrections into continuum thermal models and for interpreting phonon-resolved thermometry experiments.</p>

            <h2>Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover</p>
            <p>Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany-Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</p>

            <p>We investigate HgTe/Nb-based three-terminal Josephson junctions in T-shaped and X-shaped geometries and their critical current contours (CCCs). By decomposing the CCCs into the contributions from individual junctions, we uncover how bias current and magnetic field jointly determine the collective Josephson behavior. A perpendicular magnetic field induces a tunable crossover between SQUID-like and Fraunhofer-like interference patterns, controlled by the applied bias. Moreover, magnetic flux produces pronounced deformations of the CCC, enabling symmetry control in the $(I_1,I_2)$ plane. Remarkably, we identify a regime of strongly enhanced Josephson diode efficiency, reaching values up to $\eta\approx 0.8$ at low bias and magnetic field. The experimental results are quantitatively reproduced by resistively shunted junction (RSJ) simulations, which capture the coupled dynamics of current and flux in these multi-terminal superconducting systems.</p>

            <h2>Detection of a Rényi Index Dependent Transition in Entanglement Entropy Scaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hatem Barghathi, Adrian Del Maestro</p>
            <p>The scaling of entanglement with subsystem size encodes key information about phases and criticality, but the von Neumann entropy is costly to access in experiments and simulations, often requiring full state tomography. The second Rényi entropy is readily measured using two-copy protocols and is often used as a proxy for the von Neumann entanglement entropy, where it is assumed to track its asymptotic scaling. Sugino and Korepiny (Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 32, 1850306 (2018)) revealed that in the ground state of some highly constrained spin models, the scaling of the von Neumann and \ren entropies can differ, varying from power law to logarithmic scaling as a function of the \ren index. Here, we construct a number-conserving many-body state that demonstrates a Rényi-index-dependent change in the leading entanglement scaling, generalizing previous results to the case of interacting fermions. We introduce a symmetry-aware lower bound on the von Neumann entropy built from charge-resolved Rényi entropies that can provide a protocol for diagnosing anomalous entanglement scaling from experimentally accessible data.</p>

            <h2>Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prabakaran Rajamanickam</p>
            <p>Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.</p>

            <p>Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have traditionally addressed vastly different length scales - one resolving atoms, the other engineering macroscopic motion. Here we unite these two fields to perform minimally invasive-measurements of high aspect-ratio MEMS resonators using the STM tip as both actuator and detector. Operating at cryogenic temperatures, we resolve acoustic modes of millimeter-scale, high-Q membranes with picometer spatial precision, without making use of lasers or capacitive coupling. The tunneling junction introduces negligible back-action or heating, enabling direct access to the intrinsic dynamics of microgram-mass oscillators. In this work we explore three different measurement modalities, each offering unique advantages. Combined, they provide a pathway to quantum-level readout and exquisite high-precision measurements of forces, displacements, and pressures at cryogenic conditions. This technique provides a general platform for minimally-perturbative detection across a wide range of nanomechanical and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The bulk-disclination correspondence (BDC) is a fundamental concept in Hermitian systems that has been widely applied to predict disclination states. Recently, disclination states have also been observed and experimentally verified in non-Hermitian systems with C6 lattice symmetry, where gain and loss are introduced to induce non-Hermiticity. In this Letter, we propose a non-Hermitian two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) disclination model with skin-topological (ST) disclination states, and calculate its biorthogonal Zak phase. Together with the real-space disclination index, we predict the emergence of disclination states in a C4-symmetric non-Hermitian lattice and the corresponding fractional charge. We also generalize the symmetry indicator within the biorthogonal framework to predict the anomalous filling near the disclination core. Experimentally, the model is implemented on a nonreciprocal circuit platform, where we analyze the impedance matrix characterized by complex eigenfrequencies and directly observe the ST disclination states. Our work further extends the bulk-disclination correspondence to the non-Hermitian realm.</p>

            <h2>The Fate of Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilles Parez, William Witczak-Krempa</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingwei Hou, Fusheng Wang, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>This study presents a novel, versatile traction force microscopy framework for quantifying three-dimensional (3D) interfacial forces during bio-adhesion by integrating in situ stereo digital image correlation with finite element (FE) simulation. The method enables accurate measurement of microscale displacements and force distributions at the interfaces in both dry and wet environments, addressing limitations of conventional microscopy techniques related to limited measurement scales, restricted fields of view, and surface disturbance from contact or fluorescence. An analytical model was developed to guide the design of a deformable substrate, supporting selection of substrate material and thickness of the substrate. System accuracy was examined through steel ball compression experiments, which were validated against FE simulations. The framework was applied to marine mussel plaque adhesion under 15 directional tension to characterize interfacial traction force distributions. Sensitivity analyses examined the effects of Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and constitutive models on the results. This approach offers a versatile platform for investigating interfacial mechanics in adhesives, with broad relevance to bioengineering applications.</p>

            <p>Light possesses both spin and orbital angular momentum. In spatially asymmetric optical fields, these properties undergo spontaneous coupling, referred to as optical spin-orbit coupling. The study of the coupling has recently become central in modern optics due to its substantial applications in communications, sensing, and quantum control. A key challenge is to clarify the relationship between the origins of spatially asymmetric optical fields and the resulting spin-orbit coupling. Current research focuses on materials and configurations exhibiting spatial asymmetry, such as focusing lenses, interfaces, inhomogeneous media, and metasurfaces. However, Maxwell's equations indicate that matter can introduce both spatial and temporal asymmetry into optical fields. For instance, magnetic ordering breaks the time-reversal symmetry of interacting optical fields via the magneto-optical effect, introducing nonreciprocity in the resulting optical phenomena. Despite the importance, optical phenomena involving both spatially and temporally asymmetric optical fields remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that breaking time and spatial symmetries through magnons and light focusing, respectively, transforms an input Gaussian beam into a specific optical vortex beam in a nonreciprocal manner. This phenomenon is quantitatively explained by integrating the physics of magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering with optical spin-orbit coupling. The observed conservation of total angular momentum, encompassing both magnons and photons, further indicates that magnons can control both spin and orbital angular momentum of light. Finally, we outline future research directions enabled by asymmetric optical fields in both space and time.</p>

            <p>Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) emerge as promising quantum light sources at room temperature, with potential applications in quantum communications, among others. The temporal coherence of emitted photons (i.e. their capacity to interfere and distribute photonic entanglement) is essential for many of these applications. Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the temporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In this work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN defect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson interferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal delay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds, highlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are four orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter. We also analyze the single photon characteristics of the emission via correlation measurements, defect blinking dynamics, and its Debye-Waller factor. Our room temperature results highlight the presence of a strong phonon-electron coupling, suggesting the need to work at cryogenic temperatures to enable quantum photonic applications based on photon interference.</p>

            <h2>Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefanos R. Kousvos, Andreas Stergiou</p>
            <p>A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.</p>

            <p>In the last few years several ``universal'' interatomic potentials have appeared, using machine-learning approaches to predict energy and forces of atomic configurations with arbitrary composition and structure, with an accuracy often comparable with that of the electronic-structure calculations they are trained on. Here we demonstrate that these generally-applicable models can also be built to predict explicitly the electronic structure of materials and molecules. We focus on the electronic density of states (DOS), and develop PET-MAD-DOS, a rotationally unconstrained transformer model built on the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, and trained on the Massive Atomistic Diversity (MAD) dataset. We demonstrate our model's predictive abilities on samples from diverse external datasets, showing also that the DOS can be further manipulated to obtain accurate band gap predictions. A fast evaluation of the DOS is especially useful in combination with molecular simulations probing matter in finite-temperature thermodynamic conditions. To assess the accuracy of PET-MAD-DOS in this context, we evaluate the ensemble-averaged DOS and the electronic heat capacity of three technologically relevant systems: lithium thiophosphate (LPS), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and a high entropy alloy (HEA). By comparing with bespoke models, trained exclusively on system-specific datasets, we show that our universal model achieves semi-quantitative agreement for all these tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning can be performed using a small fraction of the bespoke data, yielding models that are comparable to, and sometimes better than, fully-trained bespoke models.</p>

            <p>Superconducting protected qubits aim to achieve sufficiently low error rates so as to allow realization of error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computers. A recent proposal encodes a protected qubit in the quasicharge degree of freedom of the conventional transmon device. Operating such a protected `quasicharge qubit' requires implementing new strategies. Here we show that an electronically-controllable tunnel junction formed by two topological superconductors can be used to implement single- and two-qubit gates on quasicharge qubits. Schemes for both these gates are based on the same dynamical $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect and therefore have the same gate times and error characteristics. We simulate the dynamics of a topological Josephson junction in a parameter regime with non-negligible charging energy, and characterize the robustness of such gate operations against charge noise. Our results point to a compelling strategy for implementation of quasicharge qubit gates based on junctions of minimal Kitaev chains of quantum dots.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory is associated with the GfE Lagrangian given by the Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) between the true metric and the metric induced by the matter fields and the curvature. The GfE action leads to the GfE modified gravity equations displaying an emergent dynamical cosmological constant. Interestingly, the GfE equations of motion reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view and we associate the energy density of the GfE to the emergent dynamical cosmological constant of the theory. Focusing on homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, we reveal that the GfE universes associated with the FRW metrics are thermal. Indeed they are associated with the $k$-temperatures and the $k$-pressures which are related to their local GQRE and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated in the low energy, small curvature limit with matter content modelled as perfect fluid, where the solutions of the GfE equations of motion are well approximated by the Friedmann universes. We show that while the total GQRE per unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of GfE universes is not decreasing in time. These results provide a natural thermodynamic interpretation of GfE cosmologies and a framework for reconciling local complexity with the global increase in entropy of the universe.</p>

The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in quantum technologies and related experiments have created a need for highly accurate, versatile, and computationally efficient simulation techniques for the dynamics of open quantum systems. Long-lived correlation effects (non-Markovianity), system-environment hybridization, and the necessity for accuracy beyond the Born-Markov approximation form particular challenges. Approaches to meet these challenges have been introduced, originating from different fields, such as hierarchical equations of motion, Lindblad-pseudomode formulas, chain-mapping approaches, quantum Brownian motion master equations, stochastic unravelings, and refined quantum master equations. This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems. How are different approaches related to each other? What are their strengths and limitations? Here we give a systematic overview and concise discussion addressing these questions. We make use of a unified framework which very conveniently allows to link different schemes and, this way, may also catalyze further progress. In line with the state of the art, this framework is formulated not in a fully reduced space of the system but in an extended state space which in a minimal fashion includes effective reservoir modes. This in turn offers a comprehensive understanding of existing methods, elucidating their physical interpretations, interconnections, and applicability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Zhu, Dongling Liu, Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Zhigang Wu, Zhongbo Yan</p>
            <p>When a coplanar antiferromagnet (AFM) with $xy$-plane magnetic moments exhibits a spin-split band structure and unidirectional spin polarization along $z$, the spin polarization is forced to be an odd function of momentum by the fundamental symmetry $[\bar{C}_{2z}\|\mathcal{T}]$. Coplanar AFMs displaying such odd-parity unidirectional spin splittings are known as odd-parity magnets. In this work, we propose the realization of their missing even-parity counterparts. We begin by deriving the symmetry conditions required for an even-parity, out-of-plane spin splitting. We then show that irradiating a spin-degenerate coplanar AFM with circularly polarized light lifts the $[\bar{C}_{2z}|\mathcal{T}]$ constraint, dynamically generating this even-parity state. Specifically, the light-induced unidirectional spin splitting exhibits a $d$-wave texture in momentum space, akin to that of a $d$-wave altermagnet. We prove this texture's robustness against spin canting and show it yields a unique clover-like angular dependence in the Drude spin conductivity. Our work demonstrates that optical driving can generate novel spin-split phases in coplanar AFMs, thereby diversifying the landscape of materials exhibiting distinct spin splittings.</p>

As opposed to spin-orbit coupling, the splitting resulting from these "altermagnets" is not a small relativistic correction and, in contrast to ferromagnets, not accompanied by a net magnetization and large stray fields. In particular, the theoretical analysis of the interplay of altermagnetism and superconductivity has taken center stage, while experimental investigations of their coexistence remain in their infancy. We here study heterostructures consisting of Nb thins films interfaced with the $T_1$ and $T_2$ phases of Mn$_3$Pt. These non-collinear magnetic states can be thought of as descendants from the same altermagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate the non-trivial impact on the superconducting state of Nb, which exhibits a zero-field superconducting diode effect, despite the compensated ($T_2$) and nearly-compensated ($T_1$) magnetic order; the diode efficiencies can reach large values (up to 50$\%$). The diode effect is found to be highly sensitive to the form of the magnetic order, illustrating its potential as a symmetry probe. The complex magnetic field and temperature dependence hint at a rich interplay of multiple contributing mechanisms. Our results define a new materials paradigm for dissipationless spintronics and magnetization-free diode functionality, while motivating further exploration of non-collinear altermagnetic superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Optical Spectroscopy of Waveguide coupled Er$^{3+}$ ensembles in CaWO$_4$ and YVO$_4$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Becker, Anna Selzer, Lorenz J. J. Sauerzopf, Catherine L. Curtin, Sudip KC, Tim Schneider, Kai Müller</p>
            <p>We present an optical study of near-surface Er$^{3+}$ ensembles in waveguide-integrated CaWO$_4$ and YVO$_4$, investigating how nanophotonic coupling modifies rare-earth spectroscopy. In particular, we compare bulk excitation with evanescently coupled TE and TM waveguide modes. In Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$, we observe a pronounced polarization-dependent surface effect. TE-coupled spectra closely reproduce bulk behavior. In contrast, TM coupling induces strong inhomogeneous broadening and an asymmetric low-energy shoulder of the site S1 Y1Z1 transition, with linewidths exceeding those of the bulk by more than a factor of four. Temperature-dependent measurements and surface termination studies indicate that surface charges are the dominant mechanism. Er$^{3+}$:YVO$_4$ remains largely unaffected by mode polarization, and surface termination leads only to minor spectral shifts. These observations suggest that non-charge-neutral rare-earth systems are more susceptible to surface-induced decoherence sources than charge-neutral hosts.</p>

            <h2>The emergence of net chirality in two-dimensional Dirac fermions system with altermagnetic mass</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng-Yi Liu, Yu-Hao Wan, Qing-Feng Sun</p>
            <p>In two-dimensional lattice systems, massless Dirac fermions undergo doubling, leading to the cancellation of net chirality. We demonstrate that the recently discovered altermagnetism can induce a unique mass term, the altermagnetic mass term, which gaps out Dirac cones with one chirality while maintaining the other gapless, leading to the emergence of net chirality. The surviving gapless Dirac cones retain identical winding numbers and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the presence of the trivial constant mass term. When subjected to an external magnetic field, the altermagnetic mass induces Landau level asymmetry in Dirac fermions, resulting in fully valley-polarized quantum Hall edge states. Our findings reveal that Dirac fermions with the altermagnetic mass harbor rich physical phenomena warranting further exploration.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Otto heat-engine with Kitaev-Heisenberg cluster: Possible roles of frustration, magnons, and duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheikh Moonsun Pervez, Saptarshi Mandal</p>
            <p>We study the performance of Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) clusters as working media realizing a quantum Otto engine (QOE). An external Zeeman field with linear time dependency is used as the driving mechanism. The efficiency strongly depends on Kitaev ($\kappa$) and Heisenberg ($J$) exchange interaction. Interestingly, efficiency is comparable when the relative magnitude of $\kappa$ and $J$ is the same but of opposite signs. The above results are explained due to a subtle interplay of frustration, quantum fluctuation, and duality of eigen-spectra for the KH system when both the signs of $\kappa$ and $J$ are reversed. The maximum efficiency is shown to be dynamically related to eigen-spectra forming discrete narrow bands, where total spin angular momentum becomes a good quantum number. We relate this optimum efficiency to the realization of weakly interacting magnons, where the system reduces to an approximate eigen-system of the external drive. Finally, we extend our study to the large spin Kitaev model and find a quantum advantage in efficiency for $S=1/2$. The results could be of practical interest for materials with KH interactions as a platform for QOE.</p>

Here, we report evidence of a topological nodal-point superconducting phase in a one-atom-thick in-plane ferromagnet in direct proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy data reveal the presence of a double-peak low-energy feature in the local density of states of the hybrid system, which is rationalized via model calculations to be an emergent topological nodal-point superconducting phase with tilted Weyl cones. Our results further establish the combination of in-plane ferromagnetism and conventional superconductivity as a route to design two-dimensional topological quantum phases.</p>

            <p>In this work, we propose a scheme to realize the layer Hall effect in the ferromagnetic topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via proximity to $d$-wave altermagnets. We show that an altermagnet and an in-plane magnetic field applied near one surface gap the corresponding Dirac cone, yielding an altermagnet-induced half-quantized Hall effect. When altermagnets with antiparallel Néel vectors are placed near the top and bottom surfaces, giving rise to the layer Hall effect with vanishing net Hall conductance, i.e., the altermagnet-induced layer Hall effect. In contrast, altermagnets with parallel Néel vectors lead to a quantized Chern insulating state, i.e., the altermagnet-induced anomalous Hall effect. We further analyze the dependence of the Hall conductance on the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field and demonstrate that the layer Hall effect becomes observable under a perpendicular electric field. Our results establish a route to engineer altermagnet-induced topological phases in ferromagnetic topological insulators.</p>

            <p>We propose the Many-body Quantum Score (MBQS), a practical and scalable application-level benchmark protocol designed to evaluate the capabilities of quantum processing units (QPUs)--both gate-based and analog--for simulating many-body quantum dynamics.

This paper presents the MBQS protocol and highlights its design principles, supported by analytical insights, classical simulations, and experimental data. It also displays results obtained with Ruby, an analog QPU based on Rydberg atoms developed by the Pasqal company.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fang Qin, Ching Hua Lee, Rui Chen</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent experimental realization of the half-quantized Hall effect phase in a three-dimensional (3D) semi-magnetic topological insulator [M. Mogi et al., Nature Physics 18, 390 (2022)], we propose a scheme for realizing the half-quantized Hall effect and axion insulator in experimentally mature 3D topological insulator heterostructures. Our approach involves optically pumping and/or magnetically doping the topological insulator surface, such as to break time reversal and gap out the Dirac cones. By toggling between left and right circularly polarized optical pumping, the sign of the half-integer Hall conductance from each of the surface Dirac cones can be controlled, such as to yield half-quantized ($0+1/2$), axion ($-1/2+1/2=0$), and Chern ($1/2+1/2=1$) insulator phases. We substantiate our results based on detailed band structure and Berry curvature numerics on the Floquet Hamiltonian in the high-frequency limit. Our paper showcases how topological phases can be obtained through mature experimental approaches such as magnetic layer doping and circularly polarized laser pumping and opens up potential device applications such as a polarization chirality-controlled topological transistor.</p>

            <p>Spin-polarized superconductors offer a rare platform for studying electronic correlations, but few candidate systems have been experimentally confirmed to date. Here, we report the observation of a spin-polarized superconducting state, denoted SC5, in WSe2-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. At in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument. We conclude that SC5 experiences a canting crossover from Ising-type to spin-polarized superconductor with increased B||.</p>

            <p>In this work, using theoretical calculations within the framework of the density functional theory, taking into account the dispersive VDW interaction, the processes of adsorption and interaction of a water molecule with a TiO2 surface in various configurations are investigated. At the atomic/molecular level, the interactions of a water molecule with a TiO2 surface have been studied for various orientations. The results of calculations within the framework of DFT+ VDW show that the adsorption energies of single water molecules in different initial positions on the substrate surface vary from-0.72 to-0.84 eV, and the most stable adsorbate structure is the TiO2+ H2O system upon adsorption of a molecule of water, parallel to the Y axis, because during the adsorption of H2O parallel to the Y axis, some favorable effects are observed in the band structure of titanium dioxide. On the one hand, the band gap decreases to 2.59 eV, and on the other hand, a new energy state appears in the band gap with an energy contribution of 0.17 eV, when water is physisorbed and interacts with a titanium atom at a distance of 2.12 Å and occupies a perpendicular position relative to the surface.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dilshod Nematov</p>
            <p>In this work, the optoelectronic characteristics of kesterites of the Cu2NiXS4 system (X = Si, Ge, Sn) were studied. The electronic properties of the Cu2NiXS4 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) system were studied using first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory. For calculations, ab initio codes VASP and Wien2k were used. The high-precision modified Beke-Jones (mBJ) functional and the hybrid HSE06 functional were used to estimate the bandgap, electronic and optical properties. Calculations have shown that when replacing Si with Ge and Sn, the band gap decreases from 2.58 eV to 1.33 eV. Replacing Si with Ge and Sn reduces the overall density of electronic states. In addition, new deep (shallow) states are formed in the band gap of these crystals, which is confirmed by the behavior of their optical properties. The obtained band gap values are compared with existing experimental measurements, demonstrating good agreement between HSE06 calculations and experimental data. The nature of changes in the dielectric constant, absorption capacity and optical conductivity of these systems depending on the photon energy has also been studied. The statistical dielectric constant and refractive index of these materials were found. The results will help increase the amount of information about the properties of the materials under study and will allow the use of these compounds in a wider range of optoelectronic devices, in particular, in solar cells and other devices that use solar radiation to generate electric current.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harald Schmid, Felix von Oppen, Gil Refael, Yang Peng</p>
            <p>We define a quantum charger as an interacting quantum system that transfers energy between two drives. The key figure of merit characterizing a charger is its charging power. Remarkably, the presence of long-range interactions within the charger can induce a collective steady-state charging mode that depends superlinearly on the size of the charger, exceeding the performance of noninteracting, parallel units. Using the driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and power-law interacting spin chains, we show that this effect persists up to a critical system size set by the breakdown of the high-frequency regime. We discuss optimal work output as well as experimentally accessible initial states. The superlinear charging effect can be probed in trapped-ion experiments, and positions interacting Floquet systems as promising platforms for enhanced energy conversion.</p>

For a TMD host with 2H structure, compounds exhibiting A-type antiferromagnetism are $g$-wave altermagnets by symmetry. We identify several intercalated TMDs fulfilling the conditions for altermagnetic order to be realized. Several of these candidate materials display spin-splittings at the Fermi level as large as 100 meV.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cecilia Herrero, Lyderic Bocquet, Benoit Coasne</p>
            <p>While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.</p>

            <p>X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) enables direct access to atomic-scale dynamics in disordered materials, revealing both spontaneous and X-ray-induced relaxation processes. Here, we study two compositionally similar alloy glasses near their glass transition temperatures: the phase change material (PCM) Ge15Sb85 and the non-PCM alloy Ge15Te85. Both exhibit X-ray induced atomic motion, yet with markedly different responses. Ge15Sb85 undergoes an immediate transition to a photo-induced yielding state, characterised by stationary dynamics governed solely by the absorbed dose. In contrast, Ge15Te85 shows a progressive slowing-down of the relaxation process, accompanied by a crossover from compressed to stretched exponential decay in the density autocorrelation functions. This behaviour is consistent with the emergence of liquid-like collective motion as supported by de Gennes narrowing in the wave-vector dependence of the dynamics at length scales comparable with the first sharp diffraction peak. Unlike Ge15Sb85, this alloy does not reach a stationary regime within experimental timescales, implying that the yielding transition occurs only after thousands of seconds with the available dose rate. Its response is also temperature dependent: at lower temperatures, the dynamics reflects intrinsic stress relaxation processes, whereas at higher temperatures becomes dose-controlled. These findings demonstrate that the dynamical response to X-ray excitation is not determined solely by chemical composition or bonding character, but results from the interplay between irradiation effects and structural relaxation pathways.</p>

            <p>Pyrochlore magnets of the form $R_2B_2$O$_7$, in which rare-earth ions on the $R$-site form a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra, provide a canonical setting for geometrical frustration. Ho-based pyrochlores host a dipolar spin-ice ground state, characterized by Ising moments constrained by the ice rules and elementary excitations analogous to magnetic monopoles. Here we examine how controlled chemical disorder influences this state by introducing site mixing on the non-magnetic $B$-site in two compounds. Ho$_2$GaSbO$_7$ contains only Ga$^{3+}$/Sb$^{5+}$ charge disorder, whereas Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$ exhibits both charge and substantial size disorder arising from the large ionic-radius mismatch between Sc$^{3+}$ and Sb$^{5+}$. Although both materials retain the pyrochlore structure, neutron scattering measurements reveal a reduced correlation length for the $R/B$-site cation ordering and enhanced local structural distortions in Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$. Despite these structural differences, bulk thermodynamic measurements and magnetic diffuse scattering demonstrate that both systems exhibit the defining signatures of a dipolar spin-ice state. Low-energy inelastic neutron spectroscopy further uncovers broad magnetic excitations that develop within the dipolar spin-ice regime, a feature absent in pristine Ho pyrochlores and indicative of disorder-induced splitting of the non-Kramers ground-state doublet. Together, these results show that controlled disorder generates tunable transverse-field-driven quantum fluctuations in Ho-based pyrochlores, although the dipolar spin-ice state is remarkably robust to this disorder.</p>

            <p>The implementation of polaritonic materials into nanoscale devices requires selective tuning of parameters to realize desired spectral or thermal responses. One robust material is {\alpha}-MoO3, which as an orthorhombic crystal boasts three distinct phonon dispersions, providing three polaritonic dispersions of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) across the mid-infrared (MIR). Here, the tunability of both optical and thermal responses in isotopically enriched {\alpha}-MoO3 (98MoO3, Mo18O3 and 98Mo18O3) are explored. A uniform ~5 % spectral redshift from 18O enrichment is observed in both Raman- and IR-active TO phonons. Both the in- and out-of-plane thermal conductivities for the isotopic variations are reported. Ab initio calculations both replicate experimental findings and analyze the select-mode three-phonon scattering contributions. The HPhPs from each isotopic variation are probed with s-SNOM and their Q- factors are reported. A Q-factor maxima increase of ~50 % along the [100] in the RB2 and ~100 % along the [001] in the RB3 are reported for HPhPs supported in 98Mo18O3. Observations in both real and Fourier space of higher-order HPhP modes propagating in single slabs of isotopically enriched {\alpha}-MoO3 without the use of a subdiffractional surface scatterer are presented here. This work illustrates the tunability of {\alpha}-MoO3 for thermal and nanophotonic applications.</p>

            <p>We address the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model on a chain, with $N$ the number of degenerate orbitals, or colors, for each fermion. In the limit of both large number of colors $N$ and particles, and small number of sites $L \geq 2$, the model is proved to undergo a $\mathbb{Z}_L$ symmetry breaking for attractive local interaction amplitude $U$. Using a combination of Exact Diagonalization with full SU(N) symmetry, generalized L-levels Holstein-Primakoff transformation, Hartree-Fock method and large-N saddle point approximation of the partition function, we extend the results obtained in [PRA 111, L020201 (2025)] to $L \geq 3$ and finite temperature $T>0$. In particular, we show that at $T=0$ for $U<U_c\sim -1/N$, the ground state is L-fold degenerate, while for positive temperatures, the critical temperature is both proportional to $N$ and $U$, i.e. $T_c \propto -U N$, making this phase transition particularly suitable for large-N fermions.</p>

            <p>High-k oxides such as SrTiO3 promise large capacitance, but their dielectric response is often limited by leakage currents due to reduced bandgaps. We show that introducing a thin barrier layer beneath SrTiO3 is a simple and effective way to suppress leakage and increase charge density. Using hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, we grew uniform SrTiO3 films on Nb:SrTiO3, CaSnO3/Nb:SrTiO3, and 2-inch SiO2/p-Si stacks to directly compare how different barrier layers influence device behavior. Both CaSnO3 and SiO2 reduce leakage, but the ultra-wide-bandgap SiO2 layer enables much higher operating voltages, yielding charge densities exceeding 5x10^13 cm^-2 at room temperature - more than a fivefold enhancement compared to devices without a barrier layer. This improvement comes with a predictable trade-off: the lower dielectric constant of SiO2 reduces overall capacitance, making its thickness an important design parameter. Together, these results demonstrate that rational barrier-layer engineering - including wafer-scale integration on Si - provides a clear pathway to achieving higher charge densities in SrTiO3-based dielectric devices.</p>

            <p>The development of advanced electronic devices is contingent upon sustainable material development and pioneering research breakthroughs. Traditional semiconductor-based electronic technology faces constraints in material thickness scaling and energy efficiency. Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronics and optoelectronic applications, boasting high electron mobility, mechanical strength, and a customizable band gap. Despite these merits, the Fermi level pinning effect introduces uncontrollable Schottky barriers at metal-2D-TMD contacts, challenging prediction through the Schottky-Mott rule. These barriers fundamentally lead to elevated contact resistance and limited current-delivery capability, impeding the enhancement of 2D-TMD transistor and integrated circuit properties. In this review, we succinctly outline the Fermi pinning effect mechanism and peculiar contact resistance behavior at metal/2D-TMD interfaces. Subsequently, highlights on the recent advances in overcoming contact resistance in 2D-TMDs devices, encompassing interface interaction and hybridization, van der Waals (vdW) contacts, prefabricated metal transfer and charge-transfer doping will be addressed. Finally, the discussion extends to challenges and offers insights into future developmental prospects.</p>

            <p>The transistor transformed not only electronics but everyday life, and the integrated circuit - now simply the "chip" - made computation scalable and ubiquitous. Magnonics has long promised a parallel path to low-energy information processing by using spin waves instead of charge. Progress, however, has been limited by two fundamental obstacles: intrinsic attenuation of spin waves and the requirement for precisely normalised output intensity and input phase to ensure reliable logic operation - conditions that are difficult to maintain in large-scale circuits owing to inevitable imperfections. Here, we report an integrated magnonic circuit that overcomes both limitations through engineered nonlinearity in nanoscale yttrium iron garnet waveguides. Nonlinear self-adjustment of the spin wave phase renders logic operation insensitive to the relative phases of the inputs, while a deeply nonlinear, threshold-activated self-normalised excitation restores and standardises the output intensity. Using space-resolved micro-focused Brillouin light scattering, we demonstrate reconfigurable AND, OR and three-input majority gates and realise deterministic cascading across sequential stages, establishing a scalable on-chip logic primitive. The architecture operates with gigahertz frequencies, supports dynamic threshold control for functional reconfiguration, and is compatible with scalable integration, making it attractive for adaptive and neuromorphic computing. By resolving phase-independent operation and signal restoration at the level of device physics, this work advances magnonics from isolated proof-of-concept devices towards integrated magnonic chips that can complement advanced CMOS in energy-constrained computing tasks.</p>

            <p>The filling of the large van der Waals gap in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) often leads to lattice and electronic instabilities, which prelude the onset of a rich phenomenology. Here, we investigate the electronic structure of the TMDs ZrTe$_2$ and Ni-intercalated ZrTe$_2$ (Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, $x\approx 0.05$) employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We readily identify in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$ two flat bands, most likely associated with localized Ni-derived 3$d$-states, at about $\approx-0.7$ eV and $\approx-1.2$ eV in binding energy. The presence of these flat bands is observed for all temperatures ($T$) in our study. More significantly, at low-$T$, we identify an electronic structure reconstruction in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, which halves the electronic periodicity along the $k_{z}$ direction. This is reminiscent of a commensurate band folding with wave-vector $q=(0,0,\pi)$. Together with previous results from macroscopic measurements, namely heat capacity and resistivity, our findings suggest that Ni intercalation drives a structural instability at $T^{*}=287$ K, which causes the observed electronic band reconstruction. Our findings invite further investigation into the structural properties of ZrTe$_2$ and of the intercalated and defect-engineered versions of this material.</p>

            <h2>Realization of a universal topological waveguide by tuning adiabatic geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Funayama, Jotaro J. Nakane, Ai Yamakage</p>
            <p>Quantum valley Hall-based topological phases have been attracting attention across diverse fields as a robust platform for wave guidance due to their high compatibility with engineering frameworks. Combining three representative boundary types enables topological waveguides with flexible designability and enhanced functionality. However, one of the three, namely the armchair boundary, has long been limited by inter-valley scattering, resulting in weak topological protection and severely restricting its use in practical devices. This long-standing constraint is a major barrier to realizing broadly applicable topological waveguide systems. Here, to address this challenge toward a broadly applicable design framework for topological waveguides, we experimentally demonstrate that topological adiabatic geometry implemented in a micro electromechanical system suppresses valley mixing. We found that the adiabaticity enhances immunity to defects and increases the transmission efficiency of the armchair boundary. As the adiabaticity increases, topological protection is recovered over an increasingly broad portion of the bulk band gap, extending from low to high frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the recovery of protection in the adiabatic armchair boundary enables waves to propagate through 90^° and 150^°-bent waveguides by coupling with other interface geometries. Suppressing valley mixing via adiabaticity paves the way for a universal design framework for topological waveguides and for restoring robust topological characteristics across a wide range of wave phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Fu, Longfei Lv, Fan Zhang, Si Zhou, Weiwei Gao, Jijun Zhao</p>
            <p>Singlet fission (SF) provides a promising strategy for surpassing the Shockley-Queisser limit in photovoltaics. However, the identification of efficient SF materials is hindered by the limited availability of suitable molecular candidates and the high computational costs associated with conventional quantum-chemical methods for excited states. In this study, we introduce a high-throughput screening framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) with multi-level validation to accelerate the discovery of SF-active molecules. Trained on a previously reported FORMED database, the GNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting SF-relevant excited-state properties, demonstrating a mean absolute error of about 0.1 eV for S1, T1, and T2 excitation energies. This capability facilitates the efficient screening of over 20 million molecular structures from both OE62 and QO2Mol databases. Our framework significantly reduces the computational demand associated with Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory validation by four orders of magnitude and identifies 180 potential SF molecules along with more than 1000 conformers. Subsequent assessments regarding synthetic accessibility, GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations further highlight a subset of experimentally feasible candidates among these SF candidates. The approach presented herein exemplifies an effective strategy for accelerating the discovery of functional molecules with optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Stable boundary modes for fragile topology from spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kang Yang, Fei Song, Piet W. Brouwer</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional topological insulators protected by nonlocal symmetries or with fragile topology usually do not admit robust in-gap edge modes due to the incompatibility between the symmetry and the boundary. Here, we show that in a parity-time (PT) symmetric system robust in-gap topological edge modes can be stably induced by non-Hermitian couplings that spontaneously break the PT symmetry of the eigenstates. The topological edge modes traverse the imaginary spectral gap between a pair of fragile topological bands, which is opened by the presence of the non-Hermitian perturbation. We demonstrate that the net number of resulting in-gap modes is protected by an operator version of anomaly cancellation that extends beyond the Hermitian limit. The results imply that loss and gain can in principle drive fragile topological phenomena to stable topological phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Universal coarsening of a two-dimensional Bose gas under conservative evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew J. Groszek, Thomas P. Billam</p>
            <p>We investigate the phase ordering dynamics of a uniform two-dimensional Bose gas quenched to a finite temperature in the superfluid phase. Starting from a defect-rich, far-from-equilibrium state, we model the subsequent evolution with the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which conserves both energy and particle number. By tuning the initial energy, we control the effective post-quench temperature and examine its role in the equilibration dynamics. We find that the gas exhibits universal behaviour at all temperatures, evidenced by spatio-temporal scaling of correlation functions and power-law growth of the correlation length $\sim t^{1/z}$, with $z$ the dynamical critical exponent. We find $z$ to be temperature dependent, with $z \approx 1.5$ for post-quench temperatures just below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, and $z \approx 1.9$ for quenches to near-zero temperature. Analysis of the Porod tail of the momentum distribution suggests a temperature-dependent competition between vortices and sound waves in the coarsening process. The two-time correlation function also exhibits universal scaling, decaying as $\sim t^{-\lambda/z}$, with autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$. Near the BKT transition we obtain $\lambda \approx 2$, whereas $\lambda$ is found to diverge as the effective temperature approaches zero.</p>

            <h2>Protein-Water Energy Transfer via Anharmonic Low-Frequency Vibrations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon Neff, Matthias Heyden</p>
            <p>Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.</p>

            <p>Electronic nematicity in Fe-based superconductors is manifested by spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking and the formation of nematic domains with mutually orthogonal directions of $d_{xz}$/$d_{yz}$ orbital anisotropy. However, its energy dependence has remained largely unexplored in real space. Using 5.82-eV laser-excited photoemission electron microscopy (laser-PEEM) with an energy-selective slit, we visualize the evolution of linear dichroic (LD) contrast within individual nematic domains of Ba$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($x\approx0.08$). We discover a sign reversal of the LD contrast at an energy $\sim0.4$ eV below the Fermi level, directly revealing an inversion of orbital anisotropy inside each domain. This behavior reflects a different energy-dependent redistribution of spectral weight between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ states, highlighting the crucial role of orbital-selective coherence in the nematic phase of Fe-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic Step Jamming in Nanometer-Scale KPZ-like Rough Surfaces under Interface-Limited Crystal Growth and Retreat</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noriko Akutsu, Yoshihiro Kangawa</p>
            <p>We investigate an intrinsic step-jamming phenomenon at the nanometer scale on Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)-like kinetically roughened crystal surfaces that arises during interface-limited steady crystal growth or retreat. Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm on a restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) lattice model demonstrate that intrinsic step jamming persists on surfaces below 20 nm. In the present model, transport processes such as surface and volume diffusion are excluded, as are elastic interactions, step-step repulsion or attraction, and stoichiometric effects. We show that intrinsic step jamming arises from asymmetric fluctuations in atomic attachment and detachment driven by biased transition probabilities under the SOS restriction, leading to collective step congestion. Asymmetric fluctuations also determine whether adatom or hole clusters grow or recede. This mechanism bears close similarity to jamming phenomena in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), including multi-lane variants. In contrast, symmetric thermal fluctuations generate adatom or hole clusters on terraces, thereby suppressing intrinsic step jamming. Possible routes to suppress intrinsic step jamming, including experimentally accessible strategies, are also discussed.</p>

            <p>Radiation-tolerant semiconductors have traditionally been engineered by the principle of suppressing defect accumulation and amorphization, based on the assumption that radiation damage is inherently stochastic. Here we show that, in monoclinic $\beta$-\ce{Ga2O3}, a promising ultrawide-bandgap semiconductor, surface crystallographic orientation deterministically governs radiation tolerance through highly anisotropic kinetics of the $\beta$-to-$\gamma$ phase transition. Using machine-learning molecular dynamics coupled with a local configurational-entropy descriptor, we quantitatively map anisotropic $\beta$-to-$\gamma$ transition kinetics, showing that the critical dose, transition-layer depth, and kinetic stability of the $\gamma$-phase are fundamentally governed by surface orientation. Under ion irradiation, non-channeling surfaces such as (100), (001), and (-201) undergo severe surface amorphization, whereas the strongly channeling (010) surface resists damage accumulation and promotes subsurface $\gamma$-phase nucleation. During thermal annealing recovery process, these initial states follow two distinct recovery pathways: the channeling (010) surface reverts directly from $\gamma$-to-$\beta$, whereas non-channeling surfaces follow a sequential amorphous-to-$\gamma$-to-$\beta$ transition pathway. This work establishes surface orientation as a fundamental design principle for achieving radiation tolerance through controlled polymorphic transitions, providing a universal framework for engineering functional materials capable of withstanding extreme irradiation environments.</p>

            <p>Given the intimate connection between magnetic orders and the interplay among multiple degrees of freedom in heavy-fermion systems, controlling and understanding the associated inverse melting effect is crucial for unveiling novel condensed-matter states and their potential applications. Here, we report the growth of single crystalline quasi-two-dimensional van-der-Waals-like Kondo lattice CeSn$_{0.75}$Sb$_2$, and its physical properties by a combination of transport / magnetic / thermodynamic measurements. We find that it hosts a fragile antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and a cluster glass (CG) ground state, both of which are highly sensitive to external fields. Upon cooling under low in-plane magnetic fields, the AFM phase evolves into a polarized paramagnetic phase, either directly or indirectly through the intermediate CG phase. This process constitutes an inverse magnetic melting effect that restores the broken translational / rotational symmetries. Our work provides a rare paradigm of inverse magnetic melting effect in vdW-like heavy-fermion materials, and enriches the physics in conventional Kondo-lattice models.</p>

            <p>Mn-based antiperovskites that exhibit topological surface states show potential applications in spintronics, magnetoelectronics, and quantum devices owing to the interplay between magnetism and topology. In this family of compounds, Mn$3$SnC exhibits a concurrent ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground state below $T \sim 285$ K, along with a Berry curvature driven anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the anomalous Hall effect in Ge- and Zn-doped Mn$3$SnC compounds, namely Mn$3$Sn${0.5}$Ge${0.5}$C (MSGC) and Mn$3$Sn${0.5}$Zn${0.5}$C (MSZC). MSGC undergoes a paramagnetic to concurrent antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic transition at $T_C \sim 300$ K, whereas MSZC exhibits a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at $T_C \sim 240$ K, followed by a ferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition at $T_N \sim 170$ K. The electronic transport in these compounds is governed by electron-phonon and electron-magnon scattering and shows anomalous Hall resistivity $\rho^A_{xy}$. Our analysis indicates that the anomalous Hall effect arises from contributions of skew scattering and intrinsic Berry curvature mechanisms, with electron-phonon and electron-magnon scattering playing an important role in skew scattering at high temperatures. Ge and Zn doping in Mn$_3$SnC significantly enhances the anomalous Hall conductivity.</p>

            <p>The interplay among quantum degrees of freedom-spin, orbital and momentum-has emerged as a fertile ground for realizing magnetic quantum states with transformative potential for electronic and spintronic technologies. Prominent examples include ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals and antiferromagnetic axion insulators. Recently, altermagnets(AMs) have been identified as a distinct spin-splitting class of collinear antiferromagnets(AFMs), characterized by crystal symmetry that connects magnetic sublattices in real space and enforces C-paired spin-momentum locking in reciprocal space. These materials combine the advantages of nonrelativistic spin-polarization akin to FMs and vanished net-magnetization as AFMs, making them highly promising for spintronic applications. Furthermore, they introduce nontrivial spin-momentum locking spin texture as an additional degree of freedom for realizing novel quantum phases. In this work, we report the discovery of a new type of spin-valley-locked nodal line phase in the layered AM Rb-intercalated V{_2}Te{_2}O. By combining high-resolution spin and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with first-principles calculations, we observe the coexistence of both spinless and spinful nodal lines near the Fermi level. Remarkably, the spinful nodal lines exhibit uniform spin polarization within each valley, while displaying opposite spin polarizations across symmetry-paired valleys-a unique feature we term spin-valley-locked nodal lines, which is exclusive to AMs. Direct measurements of out-of-plane band dispersion using a side-cleaving technique reveal the two-dimensional nature of these nodal lines. Our findings not only unveil a previously unexplored topological phase in AMs where valley-locked spin as an additional quantum character but also establish RbV{_2}Te{_2}O as a promising platform for spintronics, valleytronics, and moire-engineered quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiwei Chen, Ziyu Zhou, Jie Meng, Weiyi Wang, Ye Yang, Zhongjun Li</p>
            <p>Hexagonal MnTe has emerged as a prototypical g-wave altermagnet, hosting time-reversal symmetry breaking in momentum space despite a vanishing net magnetization. While this symmetry breaking theoretically allows for an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, experimentally observed signals have remained weak. In this work, we investigate the origin of this suppression and demonstrate a strategy to amplify anomalous transport responses within the experimentally accessible doping regime. Using a $\bm{k}\cdot\bm{p}$ effective model, we reveal that near the valence band maximum, which corresponds to the energy window relevant for typical hole doping ($\sim10^{19}cm^{-3}$), the intrinsic Hall effect is suppressed due to a symmetry-enforced cancellation of opposing Berry curvature contributions. We propose that breaking the crystalline symmetry via volume-conserving biaxial strain lifts this cancellation, resulting in a significant enhancement of the anomalous Hall conductivity by orders of magnitude. This strain-induced Fermi surface distortion also amplifies the anomalous Nernst effect. Furthermore, the analysis of the spin texture confirms that these strain-enabled anomalous transport signatures emerge while preserving the zero net magnetization.</p>

Here we investigate the structural and electronic properties of an epitaxial 2D $\alpha$-antimonene, grown on Au(111). Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density-functional theory, we reveal a strong hybridization at the Sb/Au interface, which imprints a rectangular reconstruction in the Au states, producing a band folding and hybrid bands exhibiting trigonal pockets. Additionally, hybridization displaces part of the Au wavefunction in regions of large electrostatic potential gradient, thereby enhancing spin-orbit splitting. Our work underscores that the pristine electronic properties of $\alpha$-antimonene may be deeply modified by its substrate, and even overwhelmed by the bands of the latter, and also shows that spin-orbit interaction in a heavy metal (Au) can be substantially enhanced by a lighter element (Sb).</p>

Utilizing X-band electron spin resonance spectroscopy we have performed comprehensive investigations of the magnetic properties, in particular on the temperature and angular dependences of the spin susceptibility, the $g$-factor and the linewidth. Due to the $\pi$-$d$-coupling, a rearrangement of the $\pi$-spins occurs: At low temperatures the $g$-factor shifts enormously with a pronounced in-plane anisotropy that flips as the temperature decreases; the lines broaden significantly; and the spin susceptibility increases upon cooling with a kink at the phase transition. By carefully analyzing the angular dependence of $g(\theta)$ and $\Delta H(\theta)$ we reveal the influence of anisotropic Zeeman interaction in addition to spin-phonon coupling. We conclude the presence of two magnetically distinct BETS chains and discuss the possibility of altermagnetic order.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional Janus hydrogenated transition metal chalcogenides provide an unusual platform where lattice instabilities, electron-phonon coupling, and superconductivity are strongly intertwined. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that Janus 2H and 1T MoXH (X = S, Se) monolayers host an intrinsic, commensurate charge density wave (CDW) ground state originating from soft phonon modes at the Brillouin zone M point. Real-space supercell optimizations confirm that the CDW reconstruction lowers the total energy and fully stabilizes the lattice, eliminating the imaginary phonon modes present in the high-symmetry metallic structures. Analysis of the electronic susceptibility shows that the CDW instability is not driven by Fermi surface nesting, but instead arises from strong electron-phonon coupling. We further reveal a material-dependent interplay between CDW order and superconductivity. In 1T MoSH, CDW formation enhances low-energy phonon contributions and strengthens electron-phonon coupling, leading to an increased superconducting transition temperature. In contrast, for 1T MoSeH and 2H MoSeH, the CDW phase suppresses electron-phonon coupling and reduces superconductivity. Finally, we show that thermal fluctuations, compressive strain, and carrier doping can selectively suppress CDW order and restore superconductivity. These results establish Janus MoXH monolayers as a tunable two-dimensional system for exploring lattice-driven charge ordering and its competition with superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We investigate the Rice-Mele model with on-cell Kerr-type nonlinearities, where the interaction depends on the total particle number within each unit cell rather than on individual sites. This interaction enables a nontrivial interplay between topology and nonlinear dynamics in soliton pumping. In the weakly interacting regime, the ground-state soliton undergoes quantized Thouless pumping. At intermediate interaction strengths, soliton creation and annihilation break adiabaticity and disrupt quantized transport. In the strong-coupling regime, the coexistence of ground- and excited-state solitons leads to negligible coupling at energy crossings, giving rise to discrete time-translation symmetry breaking (DTTSB) in the soliton dynamics. Comparison of mean-field results with exact diagonalization along closed circular pumping paths confirms both the validity of the mean-field description and the robustness of DTTSB across different pumping trajectories. Our findings reveal how interaction-induced effects can fundamentally modify topological transport and suggest that these phenomena may be explored in cold-atom, photonic, and superconducting-circuit platforms.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments have established rare earth A15 type hydrides as a distinct family of high temperature superconductors that can be stabilized at significantly lower pressures compared to other superconducting hydrides. In particular, A15 type LaH5.75 was recently shown to be a high Tc superconductor. We have investigated a range of ternary substitutions and demonstrate that partial substitution of La by Ba stabilizes the A15 hydride lattice, with La0.75Ba0.25H5.75 identified as a stable compound. We calculate a superconducting transition temperature of approximately 183 K, almost double that of LaH5.75 at similar pressures. Ba typically acts as a 2 plus ion, while La is 3 plus. The reduced electron count disrupts the formation of H2 units and shifts the Fermi surface, leading to strongly enhanced electron phonon coupling. By contrast, substitution with Hf fails to produce any stable compounds. This work extends emerging alloy design principles in A15 hydride superconductors, demonstrating that doping can shift the Fermi level and tune the strength of the electron phonon coupling. These results provide concrete guidance for the experimental realization of new high Tc phases.</p>

            <h2>Many-electron systems with fractional electron number and spin: exact properties above and below the equilibrium total spin value</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuli Goshen, Eli Kraisler</p>
            <p>In this work, we analyze the fundamental question of what is the ensemble ground state of a general, finite, many-electron system at zero temperature, with a given, possibly fractional, electron number $N_{tot}$ and a given $z$-projection of the spin, $M_{tot}$, distinguishing between low- and high-spin cases. For the low-spin case, the general form of the ensemble ground state has been rigorously derived in J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 15, 2337 (2024), finding the presence of an ambiguity in the ground state. Here we further discuss this ambiguity, and show that it can be removed via maximization of the entropy. For the high-spin case, we find that the form of the ensemble ground state strongly depends on the system in question. Furthermore, we prove three general properties which characterize the ensemble, and narrow the list of pure states it may consist of. We relate the frontier Kohn-Sham orbital energies to total energy differences, providing a generalization of the ionization potential theorem to systems with arbitrary fractional $M_{tot}$. Furthermore, we derive expressions for new derivative discontinuities, which appear as jumps in the KS potentials when crossing a boundary in the $N_{\uparrow}$-$N_{\downarrow}$ plane. Our analytical results are supported by an extensive numerical analysis of the Atomic Spectra Database of the National Institute of Standards. The new exact conditions for many-electron systems derived in this work are instrumental for development of advanced approximations in density functional theory and other many-electron methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Cornet, Thierry Deschamps, Valérie Martinez, Dominique de Ligny, Christine Martinet</p>
            <p>The structural evolution with temperature of pure silica (SiO2), sodium-silicate (5Na2O-95SiO2, 10Na2O-90SiO2 and 25Na2O-75SiO2) and albite (15Na2O-15Al2O3-75SiO2) glasses previously densified from hot compression is monitored with a combination of small and wide angle x-ray scattering. Transient scattering maxima in the length scales associated with both techniques indicate the presence of a transitory state, suggesting the classification of the initial and final states as distinct glass states in the context of polyamorphism. In all glasses, a transient intensity peak in the small angle scattering is observed, consistent with the nucleation of a new amorphous state. Based on a comparison with the phenomenology observed in supercooled and glassy water, we propose that this structural evolution provide a strong evidence of the glass polyamorphism as the consequence of the existence of an underlying but thermodynamically defined liquid-liquid transition, independent on the polymerization degree of the system.</p>

            <p>AlYN and AlScN have recently emerged as promising nitride materials that can be integrated with GaN to form two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at heterojunctions. Electron transport properties in these heterostructures have been enhanced through careful design and optimization of epitaxial growth conditions. In this work, we report for the first time Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of 2DEGs in AlYN/GaN and AlScN/GaN heterostructures, grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. SdH oscillations provide direct access to key 2DEG parameters at the Fermi level: (1) carrier density, (2) electron effective mass (m* ~ 0.24 me for AlYN/GaN and m* ~ 0.25 me for AlScN/GaN), and (3) quantum scattering time (~ 68 fs for AlYN/GaN and ~ 70 fs for AlScN/GaN). These measurements of fundamental transport properties provide critical insights for advancing emerging nitride semiconductors for future high-frequency and power electronics.</p>

            <p>Interactions among electronic and lattice degrees-of-freedom are foundational to various phases in condensed-matter physics, yet the dynamic interplay between excitonic and phononic quasiparticles represents an equivalent, underexplored frontier. Moiré superlattices provide an ideal platform for realizing these interactions by offering localized intralayer excitons (IALX) and ultralow-energy collective lattice modes, such as phasons. Here, by optically suppressing ultrafast charge-transfer (CT) to interlayer excitons in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures, we uncover dynamics of moiré IALX revealing long lifetimes ({\tau} > 1000 ps) arising from localized Wannier and in-plane CT nature. We then observe moiré intralayer intervalley biexcitons with binding energy ~ 16 meV, with long lifetimes due to moiré confinement. Furthermore, we find time-domain signatures of strong coupling between moiré-IALX and ~ 10 micro-eV phasons, evidenced as twist-angle-dependent GHz oscillations in IALX dynamics. Our findings establish moiré superlattices as interacting hybrid quantum systems and for engineering non-equilibrium phenomena, as well as for GHz-scale optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>We investigate a series of liquid-crystalline phthalocyanines (metal-free and Cu, Zn, Ni, Co complexes) by correlating their vibrational signatures with their electronic performance in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). Raman spectroscopy reveals metal-dependent distortions of the phthalocyanine macrocycle, reflected in systematic shifts of the C-N-C and M-N vibrational modes. When integrated into OTFTs, all compounds exhibit markedly enhanced current response under ultrahigh vacuum compared to an N2-rich environment, demonstrating that intrinsic charge transport is strongly suppressed by atmospheric species. Temperature-dependent measurements (100-300 K) show clear threshold-voltage shifts driven by deep interface and bulk traps, while all devices display thermally activated mobility with low activation energies (14-20 meV). These results highlight how mesomorphic order, metal coordination, and environmental conditions collectively govern charge transport in liquid-crystalline phthalocyanines, offering design guidelines for their use as orientable semiconducting materials in organic electronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhao Shi, Zhao Liu</p>
            <p>We study the twisted MoTe$_2$ homobilayer coupled to periodic driving of a circularly polarized light (CPL). Using Floquet theory in the high-frequency limit, we start from the Dirac model including both the valence and conduction bands of monolayer MoTe$_2$ to derive an effective time-independent Floquet Hamiltonian. This Floquet Hamiltonian contains explicit time-reversal symmetry breaking terms that are absent if conduction bands are neglected from the beginning of the derivation. Based on the Floquet Hamiltonian, we find the increasing of CPL driving intensity can cause the crossing of Floquet bands between the two valleys. When interactions are included, we identify the redistribution of holes during the intervalley Floquet band crossing. Accordingly, the ground state of the Floquet Hamiltonian at total hole filling $5/3$ evolves from the Laughlin-type FCI in one valley to that in the other valley.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingqiang Zhang, Liu Chang, Liyi Li, Zhe Cheng</p>
            <p>Hybrid bonding is a pivotal technology for enabling three dimensional integrated circuits. Among the foremost challenges facing 3D IC implementation is thermal management, where a deep understanding of heat conduction across bonded interfaces is essential for addressing heat dissipation and reliability issues. Nevertheless, the thermal conductance of bonded dielectric-dielectric interfaces remains poorly understood. In this study, we employ the low-temperature bonding technique integral to hybrid bonding to fabricate SiO-SiO interfaces and investigate their thermal boundary conductance using time domain thermoreflectance. Structural characterizations show high quality bonded interfaces. By fitting the data with an equivalent multilayer thermal model, we establish a lower limit TBC of 150 MW/m2-K for the SiO-SiO interfaces, which corresponds to a thermal resistance lower than that of a 9.2-nm-thick dielectric layer. These findings offer valuable insights into thermal transport in hybrid-bonded structures and provide critical guidance for the thermal design of advanced packaging solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zecheng Gan, Xuanzhao Gao, Yuqing Li</p>
            <p>Simulating the dynamics of charged particles in quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) nanoconfined systems presents a significant computational challenge due to the long-range nature of electrostatic interactions and the geometric anisotropy. To address this, we introduce a novel quasi-Ewald splitting strategy tailored for particle-based simulations in such geometry. Our splitting strategy seamlessly integrates a collection of advanced numerical techniques, including optimal quadrature rules [L. N. Trefethen, SIAM Rev. 64(1)(2022), pp.132-150], fast pairwise kernel summation methods [S. Jiang and L. Greengard, Commun. Comput. Phys. 31(1)(2022), pp.1-26], and the random batch method with importance sampling in k-space [S. Jin, L. Li, Z. Xu et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 43(4)(2021), pp.B937-B960]. The resulting algorithm achieves an O(N) overall computational complexity, where N denotes the total number of confined particles. Simulations of several prototype systems validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method. Furthermore, we present numerical observations specifically related to nanoconfined charged many-body systems, highlighting phenomena such as dielectric boundary effects, anisotropic diffusion, and the structure of the electrical double layer (EDL) under conditions of charge asymmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. V. Dmitriev, V. Ya. Krivnov, O. A. Vasilyev</p>
            <p>We study the ground state properties of the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on lattices built from ideal diamond units with competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions. The study covers the one-dimensional diamond chain and its two- and three-dimensional generalizations. The ground-state phase diagram contains four distinct phases: ferromagnetic (F), critical (C), monomer-dimer (MD), and tetramer-dimer (TD), which converge at a quadruple point. We demonstrate the presence of macroscopic ground-state degeneracy and corresponding residual entropy, which is maximal at the quadruple point and also extends throughout the MD phase and its boundaries with TD and F phases. For the diamond chain, we derive exact degeneracies, while for higher-dimensional lattices, we map the problem onto a bond percolation model or used transfer-matrix approach, enabling the numerical computation of the ground state degeneracy.</p>

            <h2>Higher-Dimensional Anyons via Higher Cohomotopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sadok Kallel, Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber</p>
            <p>We highlight that integer Heisenberg groups at level 2 underlie topological quantum phenomena: their group algebras coincide with the algebras of quantum observables of abelian anyons in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems on closed surfaces. Decades ago, these groups were shown to arise as the fundamental groups of the space of maps from the surface to the 2-sphere -- which has recently been understood as reflecting an effective FQH flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. Here we streamline and generalize this theorem using the homotopy theory of H-groups, showing that for $k \in \{1,2,4\}$, the non-torsion part of $\pi_1 \mathrm{Map}\big({(S^{2k-1})^2, S^{2k}}\big)$ is an integer Heisenberg group of level 2, where we identify this level with 2 divided by the Hopf invariant of the generator of $\pi_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$. This result implies the existence of higher-dimensional analogs of FQH anyons in the cohomotopical completion of 11D supergravity ("Hypothesis H").</p>

            <p>We present a high-throughput computational screening for fast lithium-ion conductors to identify promising materials for application in all solid-state electrolytes. Starting from more than 30,000 Li-containing experimental structures sourced from Crystallography Open Database, Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and Materials Platform for Data Science, we perform highly automated calculations to identify electronic insulators. On these ~1000 structures, we use molecular dynamics simulations to estimate Li-ion diffusivities using the pinball model, which describes the potential energy landscape of diffusing lithium with accuracy similar to density functional theory while being 200-500 times faster. Then we study the ~60 most promising and previously unknown fast conductors with full first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at several temperatures to estimate their activation barriers. The results are discussed in detail for the 9 fastest conductors, including $Li_7NbO_6$ which shows a remarkable ionic conductivity of ~5 mS/cm at room temperature. We further present the entire screening protocol, including the workflows where the accuracy of the pinball model is improved self-consistently, necessary to automatically running the required calculations and analysing their results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephanie Amos, Neno Fuller, Wai-Lun Chan, Hartwin Peelaers</p>
            <p>Organic semiconductors are attractive building blocks for electronic devices due to their low cost and flexibility. Furthermore, heterostructures with type-II band alignments can efficiently separate photogenerated charges via a charge transfer and separation process. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate model interfaces formed by zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and its fluorinated derivatives (F$_8$ZnPc and F$_{16}$ZnPc). We demonstrate that these interfaces not only exhibit a type-II band offset, but also band bending. The band bending causes both the LUMO and HOMO states to localize away from the interface. Therefore, the band bending creates a strong driving force for charge separation. We used ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) to experimentally confirm this predicted band bending. The wavefunction envelopes of vertically-stacked molecules resemble particle-in-a-box states, but this shape is lost when the molecules are staggered. These results elucidate how interface-induced band bending facilitates charge separation in all-organic heterostructures and suggest a design pathway toward improved performance in organic photovoltaic devices.</p>

            <h2>Propulsion dispersion mediated ordering transition in active particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debraj Dutta, Urna Basu</p>
            <p>We show that dispersion in propulsion strength qualitatively alters collective behavior of active multi-particle systems interacting via short-range attractive potential, giving rise to novel ordered phases that combine spatial and orientational ordering. Considering a binary mixture of active Brownian particles with two distinct self-propulsion strengths, we find that, the interplay between interaction range, self-propulsion strengths and the relative numbers of the particles with different propulsion strengths can lead to three different phases, namely, a disordered one, and two ordered ones with partial and complete spatial and orientational ordering. The partially ordered phase is characterized by formation of a ring-like assembly of the slower particles while the faster particles diffuse randomly. Two concentric rings, comprising faster and slower particles, form in the fully ordered phase. Using the example of a truncated harmonic potential, we analytically characterize the phase boundaries and identify the associated order parameters. Our results demonstrate that propulsion dispersion provides a robust and novel route to collective ordering in attractive active matter.</p>

            <p>The identification of fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In dipolar-octupolar (DO) pyrochlores, such as $\text{Ce}_2\text{Zr}_2\text{O}_7$, the candidate $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI) state is predicted to host both gapless emergent photons and a continuum of spinons. However, resolving these modes at zero field is complicated by their spectral overlap and the presence of nonmagnetic scattering near zero energy. Here, we report neutron scattering experiments on $\text{Ce}_2\text{Zr}_2\text{O}_7$ under a magnetic field along the $[1,1,1]$ direction. In contrast to previous unpolarized studies at zero-field that relied on high-temperature subtraction, we use a same-temperature high-field subtraction protocol to isolate the photon mode. Leveraging the selective coupling of the magnetic field to the dipolar degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the spectroscopic demarcation of these excitations. We observe that weak fields ($\approx 0.15$ T) suppress the low-energy photon weight while leaving the high-energy spinon continuum robust, albeit hardened. Our results, supported by gauge mean-field theory and exact diagonalization calculations, provide strong evidence for the $\pi$-flux QSI state and introduce a powerful field-tuning protocol for investigating DO-QSLs.</p>

            <p>Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</p>

            <p>Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states.</p>

            <p>We study phase separation between coexisting active and passive fluids in three-dimensions, using both numerical simulation and experiments. Chaotic flows of the active phase drive giant interfacial deformations and cause the co-existing phases to interpenetrate, generating a continuously reconfiguring bicontinuous steady-state morphology that persists over the lifetime of the active fluid. We demonstrate how activity controls the structure of the bicontinuous network. Quantitative analysis reveals the dominance of dynamical steady-state sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from the transient bicontinuous structures observed in passive liquid-liquid phase separation, where saddle-like surfaces dominate. These results demonstrate how active stresses suppress the coarsening dynamics of conventional phase separation, generating steady-state reconfigurable morphologies not accessible with conventional surface-modifying agents or through quenching of transient phase separated structures.</p>

            <p>Constructing a thermodynamic framework for nonequilibrium systems remains a major challenge, as quantities such as temperature and free energy often become ambiguous when inferred solely from steady-state properties. Here we take a transformation-based approach and experimentally examine transitions between nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Using an optically trapped microparticle driven by a tunable correlated stochastic force, we generate active-like steady states with controllable noise statistics. By abruptly changing the trap stiffness, we measure the stochastic work, heat, and entropy produced during NESS-to-NESS transformations. We identify a state-dependent effective temperature that restores the second law for these transitions, enabling the definition of a generalized work that incorporates the consequence of the nonequilibrium fluctuations. With this quantity, we derive and experimentally verify a Crooks-like fluctuation relation linking work distributions to a nonequilibrium free-energy difference defined through the effective temperature. Finally, we establish a fluctuation-response relation for the positional variance following stiffness changes. We demonstrate that this relation is key to distinguishing systems that can be described by a unique effective temperature (i.e., those under equilibrium or white-noise conditions) from those under colored-noise, where an equilibrium-like response cannot be restored. These results delineate the applicability and limits of effective-temperature thermodynamics in driven systems.</p>

Such a mechanical analog provides an alternative viewpoint that is useful to interpret and understand the nature of collective oscillations in heterogeneous networks.</p>

Here, we demonstrate the first DC-powered broadband amplifier operating within 0.2 photons of the quantum limit. Our impedance-engineered Inelastic Cooper-pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA)-a voltage-biased SQUID in which Cooper pairs tunnel inelastically by emitting signal-idler photon pairs-operates in reflection, delivering 13 dB of average gain across a 3.5 GHz bandwidth in a single stage. Semiclassical simulations accurately predict the gain and saturation power, enabling further design improvements.

            <p>The mass law is a cornerstone in predicting sound transmission loss, yet it neglects the constraints of causal dispersion. Current causality-based theories, such as the Rozanov limit, are applicable only to one-port reflective absorbers. Here, we derive a universal sum rule governing causal scattering in acoustic systems, establishing a rigorous analogy to the Baldin sum rule in quantum field theory. This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials.</p>

            <p>The locality of field theories strongly constrains the possible behaviors of symmetry-twisted partition functions, and thus they serve as order parameters to detect low-energy realizations of global symmetries, such as spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). We demonstrate that the tensor renormalization group (TRG) offers an efficient framework to compute the symmetry-twisted partition functions, which enables us to detect the symmetry-breaking transition and also to study associated critical phenomena. As concrete examples of SSB, we investigate the two-dimensional (2D) classical Ising model and the three-dimensional (3D) classical $O(2)$ nonlinear sigma model, and we identify their critical points solely from the twisted partition function. By employing the finite-size scaling argument, we find the critical temperature $T_c=2.2017(2)$ with the critical exponent $\nu = 0.663(33)$ for the 3D $O(2)$ model. In addition, we also study the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) criticality of the 2D classical $O(2)$ model by extracting the helicity modulus from the twisted partition functions, and we obtain the BKT transition temperature, $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}=0.8928(2)$.</p>

            <h2>Boundary operators in the Brownian loop soup</h2>

            <p>We obtain infinitely many boundary operators in the Brownian loop soup in the subcritical phase by analyzing the conformal block expansion of the two-point function that computes the probability of having two marked points on the upper half-plane being separated by Brownian loops. The resulting boundary operators are primary operators in a 2D CFT with central charge $c\leq1$ and have conformal dimensions that are non-negative integers. By comparing the above-mentioned conformal block expansion with probabilities in the Brownian loop soup, we provide a physical interpretation of the boundary operators of even dimensions as operators that insert multiple outer boundaries of Brownian loops at points on the real axis.</p>

            <h2>Dimension-decaying diffusion processes as the scaling limit of condensing zero-range processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johel Beltrán, Kyuhyeon Choi, Claudio Landim</p>
            <p>In this article, we prove that, on the diffusive time scale, condensing zero-range processes converge to a dimension-decaying diffusion process on the simplex \[ \Sigma = \{(x_1,\dots,x_S) : x_i \ge 0,\; \sum_{i\in S} x_i = 1\}, \] where $S$ is a finite set. This limiting diffusion has the distinctive feature of being absorbed at the boundary of the simplex. More precisely, once the process reaches a face \[ \Sigma_A = \{(x_1,\dots,x_S) : x_i \ge 0,\; \sum_{i\in A} x_i = 1\}, \qquad A \subset S, \] it remains confined to this set and evolves in the corresponding lower-dimensional simplex according to a new diffusion whose parameters depend on the subset $A$. This mechanism repeats itself, leading to successive reductions of the dimension, until one of the vertices of the simplex is reached in finite time. At that point, the process becomes permanently trapped. The proof relies on a method to extend the domain of the associated martingale problem, which may be of independent interest and useful in other contexts.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement signatures of quantum criticality in Floquet non-Hermitian topological systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Cheng, Rui Xie, Xiaosen Yang, Yuee Xie, Yuanping Chen</p>
            <p>The entanglement entropy can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phase transitions. In one-dimensional single particle systems, the periodic driving generates a variety of topological phases and edge modes. In this work, we investigate the topological phase transition of the one-dimensional Floquet Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using entanglement entropy, and construct the phase diagram based on entanglement entropy. The entanglement entropy exhibits pronounced peaks and follows the logarithmic scaling law at the phase transition points, from which we extract the central charge $c=1$. We further investigate the entanglement spectrum to accurately distinguish the different topological phases. In addition, the coupling between zero and $\pi$ modes leads to characteristic splittings in the entanglement spectrum, signaling their hybridization under periodic driving. These results remain robust in non-Hermitian regimes and in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping, demonstrating the reliability and universality of entanglement entropy as a diagnostic for topological phase transitions.</p>

            <p>This is a set of lectures on tensor networks with a strong emphasis on the core algorithms involving Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPO). Compared to other presentations, particular care has been given to disentangle aspects of tensor networks from the quantum many-body problem: MPO/MPS algorithms are presented as a way to deal with linear algebra on extremely (exponentially) large matrices and vectors, regardless of any particular application. The lectures include well-known algorithms to find eigenvectors of MPOs (the celebrated DMRG), solve linear problems, and recent learning algorithms that allow one to map a known function into an MPS (the Tensor Cross Interpolation, or TCI, algorithm). The lectures end with a discussion of how to represent functions and perform calculus with tensor networks using the "quantics" representation. They include the detailed analytical construction of important MPOs such as those for differentiation, indefinite integration, convolution, and the quantum Fourier transform. Three concrete applications are discussed in detail: the simulation of a quantum computer (either exactly or with compression), the simulation of a quantum annealer, and techniques to solve partial differential equations (e.g. Poisson, diffusion, or Gross-Pitaevskii) within the "quantics" representation. The lectures have been designed to be accessible to a first-year PhD student and include detailed proofs of all statements.</p>

            <h2>Elementary Building Blocks for Cluster Mott Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaishnavi Jayakumar, Ciarán Hickey</p>
            <p>Mott insulators, in which strong Coulomb interactions fully localize electrons on single atomic sites, play host to an incredibly rich and exciting array of strongly correlated physics. One can naturally extend this concept to cluster Mott insulators, wherein electrons localize not on single atoms but across clusters of atoms, forming "molecules in solids". The resulting localized degrees of freedom incorporate the full spectrum of electronic degrees of freedom, spin, orbital, and charge. These serve as the building blocks for cluster Mott insulators, and understanding them is an important first step toward understanding the many-body physics that emerges in candidate cluster Mott insulators. Here, we focus on elementary building blocks, neglecting some of the complexity present in real materials which can often obfuscate the underlying principles at play. Through an extensive set of exact theoretical calculations on clusters of varying geometry, number of orbitals, and number of electrons, we uncover some of the basic organizing principles of cluster Mott phases, particularly when interactions dominate and negate a simple single-particle picture. These include, for example, the identification of an additional "cluster Hund's rule", of cluster ground states that are best understood from a purely interacting perspective, and of several localized degrees of freedom which are protected by an unusual combination of discrete spatial or orbital symmetries. Finally, we discuss the impact of adding additional terms, relevant to material candidates, on the phase diagrams presented throughout, as well as the potential next steps in the journey to building a more complete picture of cluster Mott insulators.</p>

            <h2>Global thermodynamic manifold for conservative control of stochastic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordan R. Sawchuk, David A. Sivak</p>
            <p>Optimal control of stochastic systems plays a central role in nonequilibrium physics, with applications in the study of biological molecular motors and the design of single-molecule experiments. While exact analytic solutions to optimization problems are rare, under slow driving conditions, the problem can be reformulated geometrically solely in terms of equilibrium properties. In this framework, minimum-work protocols are geodesics on a thermodynamic manifold whose metric is a generalized friction tensor. Here, we introduce a new foundation for this friction-tensor formalism for conservatively driven systems. Under complete control of the potential energy, a global thermodynamic manifold (on which points are identified with instantaneous energy landscapes) has as its metric a full-control friction tensor. Arbitrary partial-control friction tensors arise naturally as inherited metrics on submanifolds of this global manifold. Leveraging a simple mathematical relationship between system dynamics and the geometry of the global manifold, we derive new expressions for the friction tensor that offer powerful tools for interpretation and computation of friction tensors and minimum-work protocols. Our results elucidate a connection between relaxation and dissipation in slowly driven systems and suggest optimization heuristics. We demonstrate the utility of these developments in three illustrative examples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yin-Kai Yu, Zhi-Xuan Li, Shuai Yin, Zi-Xiang Li</p>
            <p>The notorious fermion sign problem, arising from fermion statistics, presents a fundamental obstacle to the numerical simulation of quantum many-body systems. Here, we introduce a framework that circumvents the sign problem in the studies of quantum criticality and its associated phases by leveraging imaginary-time nonequilibrium critical dynamics. We demonstrate that the critical properties can be accurately determined from the system's short-time relaxation, a regime where the sign problem remains manageable for quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations. After validating this approach on two benchmark fermionic models, we apply it to the sign-problematic Hubbard model hosting SU(3)-symmetric Dirac fermions. We present the first numerically exact characterization of its quantum phase diagram, revealing a continuous transition between a Dirac semi-metal and a SU(3) antiferromagnetic phase. This transition defines an unconventional Gross-Neveu universality class that fundamentally reshapes current understanding of Gross-Neveu criticality. Our work provides a powerful tool for investigating sign-problematic systems and quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>We numerically demonstrate a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long- term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short- term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.</p>

Based on our proposed exact bounds, the analysis reveals that the bounds differ for particle and heat currents and are dependent on the system parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under specific parameter conditions, the TURs of the particle and heat currents have a unified minimum value that depends solely on the number of terminals.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ exceeding 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a significant breakthrough in the field of nickelate superconductors. Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</p>

            <p>In strongly correlated electronic systems, Coulomb interactions frequently manifest through emergent electronic orders that spontaneously break rotational symmetry. Understanding how such symmetry breaking intertwines with other collective phenomena -- such as unconventional superconductivity -- and how it shapes experimental observables, particularly transport responses, remains a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report a metallic phase with extreme transport anisotropy in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene, with an anisotropy ratio rivaling that of quantum Hall stripe phases. At low temperature, a superconducting state emerges from this metallic phase. Strikingly, the superconductor not only inherits strong anisotropy but also exhibits a wide range of hysteretic transitions arising from the tunability of the underlying anisotropic order. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized coexistence between superconductivity and extreme transport anisotropy, shedding new light on the role of rotational symmetry breaking in shaping unconventional superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene.</p>

Dispersive magnetic excitations were measured throughout the Brillouin zone and modeled to determine the magnetic interactions between Nd ions. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic interactions in this system extend over large distances and are significantly affected by a crystallographic superstructure formed by ordering of the Pd and Si atoms. The results suggest that the mechanism for the skyrmion phase formation in this family of materials, specifically Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$, is through the long-range RKKY interactions rather than short-range triangular-lattice frustration.</p>

            <p>The vision of a hydrogen economy demands efficient platforms to close the gap between sustainable proton sources and solid-state hydrogen carriers. Metal hydrides serve as key carriers, yet their synthesis remains constrained by the energy-intensive use of high-pressure H2, which fragments the hydrogen chain. Here, we overturn this paradigm by transforming two classic degradation mechanisms, acidic corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement, into a constructive materials-design strategy. We demonstrate that synergistic control of these processes in acid enables the in-situ engineering of a "hydrogen-trapping cage" (HTC) microstructure within metals. Composed of a dense defect network, this cage directly captures and stabilizes protons as hydrides under mild conditions, guided by the universal criterion |DeltaPeq| > DeltaPph. Using this platform, we synthesize over 20 hydrides, including challenging targets such as LiH and NaH, and showcase its functional power with a cage-rich titanium hydride electrocatalyst. This catalyst achieves an exceptional current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for nitrate-to-ammonia conversion, attributed to rapid H- transport within the engineered cage. This work establishes a transformative "failure-to-function" paradigm, delivering an integrated platform that unifies hydrogen capture, stabilization, and conversion.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments demonstrate that rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) near the lowest Landau level can self-organize into interaction-driven persistent quantum Hall droplet arrays. Inspired by this discovery, we investigate the formation and dynamics of single quantum Hall droplet and droplet arrays in rapidly rotating BECs. Guided by a rigorous theorem on localized many-body states for two-dimensional interacting systems in a magnetic field, we construct single quantum Hall droplet and droplet array states which are shown to be stationary solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the rotating frame. The single quantum Hall droplet is shown to be dynamically stable, which underpins its role as the basic unit in a droplet array. The stability of the quantum Hall droplet arrays is demonstrated by their dynamic formation from a phase engineered initial condensate. Our study sheds light onto the nature of the quantum Hall droplet state in a rapidly rotating BEC and offers a new approach for generating and manipulating quantum Hall droplet arrays through designing the initial condensate phase.</p>

            <p>Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) allows the characterization of magnetic stray field distributions with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Based on a suitable calibration procedure, MFM can also yield quantitative magnetic field values. This process typically involves measuring a reference sample to determine the distribution of the tip's stray field or stray field gradient at the sample surface. This distribution is called the tip transfer function (TTF) and is derived through regularized deconvolution in Fourier space. The properties of the reference sample and the noise characteristics of the detection system significantly influence the derived TTF, thereby limiting its validity range. In a recent study, the tip stray field distribution, and hence the TTF, of an MFM tip was independently measured in real space using a nitrogen vacancy center as a quantum sensor, revealing considerable discrepancies with the reference-sample-based TTF. Here, we analyze the influence of the feature distribution of the reference sample and the MFM measurement parameters on the resulting TTF. We explain the observed differences between quantum-calibrated stray field distributions and the classical approach by attributing them to a loss of information due to missing or suppressed spectral components. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of the spectral coverage of the TTF. Our findings indicate that for high-quality reconstruction of the stray field of a sample under test (SUT), it is more critical to ensure a strong overlap of frequency components between the reference sample and the SUT than to achieve an accurate real-space reconstruction of the tip stray field distribution.</p>

            <p>Near equilibrium, the symmetric part of the time-integrated steady-state covariance, i.e., the time integral of correlation functions, is governed by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, while the antisymmetric part vanishes due to Onsager reciprocity. Far from equilibrium, where these principles no longer apply, we develop a unified formalism for both symmetric and antisymmetric components of integrated covariances. We derive exact, computationally tractable expressions for these quantities, valid in arbitrary nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. Both components are expressed in terms of excess observables, a notion central to both statistical physics and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we establish thermodynamic upper bounds for antisymmetric covariances in terms of (pseudo-)entropy production and cycle affinities. Finally, we show that the speed up of self-averaging induced by nonequilibrium drivings which preserve kinetics (activity) is bounded by the cycle affinities (thermodynamic forces).</p>

            <p>The $q$-state Potts model is a fundamental model in statistical physics that generalizes the Ising model and plays a key role in the study of phase transitions, critical phenomena, complex systems, and combinatorial optimization. Sampling low-energy configurations of the $q$-state Potts model is essential to these studies, but it remains challenging. While physics-inspired dynamical sampling has been extensively explored for the Ising case ($q=2$) in the form of Ising machines, its generalization to general $q$-state Potts models remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a class of physics-inspired dynamical samplers that directly target general $q$-state Potts models, which we refer to as the oscillator Potts machine (OPM). We show, through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, that the OPM exhibits a systematic low-energy bias with respect to the underlying Potts energy landscape. Furthermore, we demonstrate, via phase perturbation analysis, that the OPM, as overdamped Langevin dynamics, can be realized with a network of self-sustaining oscillators, demonstrating that the OPM is naturally realizable in hardware using standard technology such as CMOS. We design a small-scale ring-oscillator circuit that implements a three-state OPM and validate its operation through transistor-level simulation. Leveraging the low-energy bias of the OPM for Potts models, we then apply it to large-scale max-$K$-cut problems by mapping these instances to $q$-state Potts Hamiltonians and compare its performance against established algorithms. Our results position the OPM as a promising, physically grounded dynamical system framework for multi-state sampling and combinatorial optimization.</p>

We show that the variation of helicoidal gauge potential with spin-orbit coupling is different in zero-momentum and plane-wave phases. The characteristics of Bloch oscillation are different in the two phases. In the zero-momentum phase, the Bloch oscillation is harmonic while it is anharmonic in the plane-wave phase. The amplitude of Bloch oscillation is found to be affected by the helicoidal gauge potential and spin-orbit coupling. We examine that the decay of Bloch oscillation caused by mean-field interaction can be managed by helicoidal spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <h2>Non-Fermi liquid behaviour of CDW instabilities in fractionally-filled moiré flatbands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moiré flatbands are known to host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analysed with the help of a dual description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterised by the nesting vectors ($ \mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\lbrace \mathbf{Q}_n \rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after constructing a minimal effective action.</p>

            <p>The fundamental role of magnetic materials in modern science and technology has driven a rapid surge in research on unconventional magnetism in recent years. In particular, altermagnets, which simultaneously exhibit zero net magnetization in real space and anisotropic spin splitting in momentum space, have garnered significant interest for both fundamental physics and technological applications. Among these, $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ stands as the pioneering and most extensively studied altermagnet. While the intrinsic magnetic order of $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ is still a subject of active debate, numerous exotic phenomena characteristic of altermagnetism have been observed in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ samples. In this review, we explore each facet of the altermagnetism through specific case studies in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, systematically surveying its crystal and magnetic structures, electronic band properties, and transport phenomena. We critically assess the debate surrounding the intrinsic magnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, incorporating evidence from altermagnetic signatures in transport, as well as contrasting results from magnetic and spectroscopic measurements. Finally, possible future research directions in this field are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter A. Noordman, Lucas Maisel Licerán, Henk T. C. Stoof</p>
            <p>Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of the interactions between these quasiparticles is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to important exchange processes that can take place between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work, we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal in position space and depends on the combined spin configurations of the electrons and holes. When particularized to the case of hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, this potential becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to the case of arbitrary masses. We also show how including corrections due to excited states into the theory results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Our approach is also applicable to more complicated systems with nonhydrogenic exciton series, such as layered semiconductors with Rytova-Keldysh interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a dilute gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in this approach the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in...</p>

            <p>We investigate the percolation behavior of Fortuin-Kasteleyn--type clusters in the spin-$1/2$ Baxter--Wu model with three-spin interactions on a triangular lattice. The considered clusters are constructed by randomly freezing one of the three sublattices, resulting in effective pairwise interactions among the remaining spins. Using Monte Carlo simulations combined with a finite-size scaling analysis, we determine the percolation temperature of these stochastic clusters and show that it coincides with the exact thermal critical point of the model. The critical exponents derived from cluster observables are consistent with those of the underlying thermal phase transition. Finally, we analyze the dynamical scaling of the multi-cluster and single-cluster algorithms resulting from the cluster construction, highlighting their efficiency and scaling behavior with system size.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor quantum processors have potential to scale to modular quantum computers, in which qubit registers are coupled by quantum links, enabling high connectivity and space for control circuitry. Individual spin-qubit registers have progressed to two-dimensional systems and execution of small quantum algorithms. Separately, high-fidelity spin shuttling has been demonstrated in linear channels defined by individual gate electrodes. Here, we realize the first shared-control shuttling link integrated between distant qubit registers to demonstrate quantum entanglement in a basic modular quantum processor based on hole spin qubits in germanium. We develop a protocol to compensate for spin-orbit-induced rotations during qubit transfer, allowing for shuttling between qubit registers separated by more than one micrometer in approximately a hundred nanoseconds. Combining local qubit operation with coherent shuttling, we generate Bell states formed by spins residing in separate registers. Characterizing them using quantum state tomography, we demonstrate entanglement between spin qubits in distant registers.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) superconductors remain superconducting down to the monolayer limit, enabling the exploration of emergent physical phenomena and functionality driven by reduced dimensionality. Here, we report the characterization of the kinetic inductance of atomically thin NbSe$_2$, a two-dimensional van der Waals superconductor, using superconducting coplanar waveguides and microwave measurement techniques familiar to circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The kinetic inductance scales inversely with the number of NbSe$_2$ layers, reaching 1.2 nH/$\Box$ in the monolayer limit. Furthermore, the measured kinetic inductance exhibits a thickness-dependent crossover from clean- to dirty-limit behavior, with enhanced dirty-limit contributions emerging in the ultra-thin regime. These effects are likely driven by increased surface scattering, multi-band superconductivity, and geometric confinement. Additionally, the self-Kerr nonlinearity of the NbSe$_2$ films ranges from $K/2\pi$ = -0.008 to -14.7 Hz/photon, indicating its strong potential in applications requiring compact, nearly linear, high-inductance superconducting quantum devices and detectors.

            <p>Electron accumulation in interatomic regions is a fundamental quantum phenomenon dictating chemical bonding and material properties, yet its origin remains elusive across disciplines. Here, we report a counterintuitive quantum effect -- potential-barrier affinity (PBA) -- revealed by solving the Schrödinger equation for a crystalline potential. PBA effect drives significant interatomic electron accumulation when electron energy exceeds the barrier maximum. This effect essentially determines interatomic electron density patterns, governing microstructures and properties of condensed matters. Our theory overturns the traditional wisdom that the interstitial electron localization in electride requires potential-well constraints or hybrid orbitals, and it serves the fundamental mechanism underlying the formation of conventional chemical bonds. This work delivers a paradigm shift in understanding electron distribution and establishes a theoretical foundation for the microscopic design of material properties.</p>

            <p>Developing reliable pseudopotentials for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT), especially for transition metals, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing pseudization strategies for OF-DFT calculations. From the analysis arises a proposed pseudization method which involves constructing local pseudopotentials by targeting existing Kohn-Sham DFT pseudopotentials through an optimized effective potential procedure. We produce four distinct sets of local pseudopotentials and evaluate their accuracy and transferability on the transition metal elements. Our results indicate a substantial improvement over previously available pseudopotentials. Although current OF-DFT functionals still only reach a qualitative accuracy for transition metals, our newly developed pseudopotentials provide a rigorous framework for further methodological advancements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex V. Plyukhin</p>
            <p>The potential of mean force (PMF) is an effective average potential acting on an open system, renormalized due to the interaction with the surrounding thermal bath. The PMF determines the correction to the equilibrium Gibbs distribution, but it is generally unclear how to implement the concept for time-dependent phenomena described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position is canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF.</p>

            <h2>Why planar cracks fragment into echelon cracks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivia Ward, Aditya Kumar</p>
            <p>Predicting the growth of large cracks in brittle materials is a fundamental unresolved problem in fracture mechanics. Under out-of-plane shear loading, an initially planar crack may fragment into multiple cracks, forming an echelon crack pattern. Explaining this phenomenon is essential for developing a general theory of crack growth. Although numerous empirical criteria have been proposed in the literature, none provide a unified explanation of all observed features and are largely restricted to two-dimensional growth in linear elastic isotropic materials. In this Letter, we confront a classical set of echelon crack growth experiments using two phase-field approaches: the classical variational model and a strength-constrained model. We show that, contrary to prevailing views, the variational model based solely on Griffith's energetic competition between elastic and fracture energies is fundamentally incomplete even for predicting the growth of large cracks. By incorporating a material strength surface that constrains the regions in which a crack can grow, the resulting model accurately predicts echelon crack growth without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about material or geometrical disorder. Results are presented for both soft and hard materials, confirming the model's general applicability to any brittle material. We further identify two governing non-dimensional parameters that control crack orientation and morphology and demonstrate that one of them, the ratio of shear to tensile strength, determines whether crack paths are more influenced by energy-based or stress-based empirical criteria, thereby reconciling these criteria within a single framework.</p>

Using a general tight-binding framework applied to multiple periodic systems, we establish the criteria for the emergence of Klein tunneling based on the conservation of an effective reduced pseudospin. The inclusion of higher-order terms in the wave vector leads to nontrivial matching conditions for wave scattering at interfaces. We further examine the emergence of multiple types of Klein tunneling in two-dimensional materials beyond graphene, including phosphorene and borophene, as well as in one-dimensional systems such as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. Finally, we discuss how these tunneling phenomena can be tested in both synthesized and artificial lattices, including elastic metamaterials, optical, photonic, phononic, and superconducting platforms, demonstrating the universality of Klein tunneling across different wave natures and length scales.</p>

            <p>Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.</p>

            <p>In the approaches based on matrix-product states (MPSs), such as the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, the ordering of the sites crucially affects the computational accuracy. We investigate the performance of an algorithm that searches for the optimal site order by iterative local site rearrangement. We improve the algorithm by expanding the range of site rearrangement and apply it to a one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model with random site permutation. The results indicate that increasing the range of the site rearrangement significantly improves the computational accuracy of the DMRG method. In particular, increasing the rearrangement range from two to three sites reduces the average relative error in the ground-state energy by 65% to 94% in the cases we tested. We also discuss the computational cost of the algorithm and its application as a preprocessing for MPS-based calculations.</p>

            <p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</p>

            <p>Pathways and structural dynamics of phase transformations impact performance of materials in energy and information storage technologies. Palladium hydride ($\mathrm{PdH}_x$) nanocrystals are an ideal model system for studying solute-induced phase transformations, where elastic energy from lattice mismatch between $\alpha$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ and $\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases is often considered a key to determining the transformation pathways. $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfacial elastic energy is affected by the confined geometry of a nanocrystal. However, how nanocrystal geometry influences phase transformation pathways is largely unknown. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize hydrogenation in Pd nanocrystals with two geometries -- a nanocube and a hexagonal nanoplate. Both follow similar sequences of an initially curved nucleus, interface flattening, and reverse-stage nucleation; however, their evolving $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibit geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. In nanocubes, $\{100\}$-aligned configurations conform to static elastic energy ordering, representing a pathway that maintains a local mechanical equilibrium, whereas nanoplates display both $\{110\}$- and $\{211\}$-aligned interfaces. Theoretical simulations show that geometry determines the accessibility of alternative phase transformation pathways as the system is driven far from equilibrium during hydrogenation. These findings identify geometry as a fundamental parameter for directing phase transformation pathways, offering design principles for accessing atypical configurations and improving properties of intercalation-based devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunyao Qi, Heng Lin, Quanfeng Lu, Dong Ruan, Gui-Lu Long</p>
            <p>We propose a disorder-free one-dimensional single-particle Hamiltonian hosting an exact mobility edge (ME), placing the system outside the assumptions of no-go theorems regarding unbounded potentials. By applying a linear Stark potential selectively to one sublattice of a dimerized chain, we generate an effective Hamiltonian with unbounded, staggered hopping amplitudes. The unbounded nature of the hopping places the model outside the scope of the Simon-Spencer theorem, while the staggered scaling allows it to evade broader constraints on Jacobi matrices. We analytically derive the bulk spectrum in reciprocal space, identifying a sharp ME where the energy magnitude equals the inter-cell hopping strength. This edge separates a continuum of extended states from two distinct localized branches: a standard unbounded Wannier-Stark ladder and an anomalous bounded branch accumulating at the ME. The existence of extended states is supported by finite-size scaling of the inverse participation ratio up to system sizes $L \sim 10^9$. Furthermore, we propose an experimental realization using photonic frequency synthetic dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that the ME is robust against potential experimental imperfections, including frequency detuning errors and photon loss, establishing a practical path for observing MEs in disorder-free systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaurav Gyawali, Henry Shackleton, Zhu-Xi Luo, Michael Lawler</p>
            <p>A central challenge in quantum error correction is identifying powerful quantum codes tailored to specific hardware and determining their error thresholds above which quantum information is unprotected. This problem is hard because we cannot determine the noise models for our devices. Inspired by the quantum capacity theorem, we seek an optimal quantum source of information, namely the density matrix that degrades minimally when passed through a noisy channel. We explore this idea with the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), a simplified model of a $N$-qubit quantum computer with competing depolarizing and dephasing channels as a stand-in for unitary gates and measurements. Through numerical optimization, we find that the ORUM hosts three discrete regimes, three "phases", the "maximally mixed source" phase, a "$\mathbb{Z}_2$ source" phase (where ORUM's $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_2$), and a no-coding phase where all information is lost. These phases exhibit first-order transitions among themselves and converge at a novel zero-capacity multicritical point. These results show a remarkable similarity between the quantum capacity theorem and Jaynes' maximum entropy principle of statistical mechanics. Using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ source, we build two codes, a classical cat code capable of correcting all the dephasing errors and a concatenated cat code capable of correcting all errors up to a distance $d=\text{min}(m,N)$ and reduces to Shor's 9-qubit code for $m=N=3$. Neither classical nor quantum code survives near the vicinity of the zero-capacity multicritical point in the source phase diagram. Applying our approach to current noisy devices could provide a systematic method for constructing quantum codes for robust computation and communication.</p>

We then exploit these insights to develop a two-variable nucleation theory, in which the cluster density is allowed to vary. Our accessible model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties over a large range of supersaturation. Remarkably, the two-variable model successfully captures the observed nucleation pathway. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework demonstrates that the cluster density is a decisive variable in nucleation, highlighting the limitations of the single-variable description while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.</p>

            <h2>Light-Driven Skyrmion Crystal Generation in Plasmonic Metasurfaces Through the Inverse Faraday Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingyu Yang, Chantal Hareau, Tristan da Câmara Santa Clara Gomes, Jack Gartside, Mathieu Mivelle</p>
            <p>Skyrmions are topological structures defined by a winding vector configuration that yields a quantized topological charge. In magnetic materials, skyrmions manifest as stable, mobile spin textures, positioning them at the forefront of spintronics research. Meanwhile, their optical counterparts unlock new possibilities for manipulating and directing light at the nanoscale. Exploring the territories where magnetism and optics meet therefore holds immense promise for ultrafast control over magnetic processes. Here, we report the generation of a skyrmion-topological lattice through the inverse Faraday effect in a plasmonic metasurface. Specifically, a hexagonal array of gold nanodisks induces unidirectional drift photocurrents in each nanodisk, while counterpropagating phantom currents arise in the hexagonal interstices. This interplay creates a lattice of skyrmionic magnetic textures. Crucially, the all optical, large scale formation of skyrmions potentially at ultrafast timescales offers a pathway for integrating these topological spin textures into magnetic materials, laying the groundwork for next-generation data storage and processing technologies.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic quantum trajectory via imaginary time evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivan Mittal, Bin Yan</p>
            <p>Stochastic quantum trajectories, such as pure state evolutions under unitary dynamics and random measurements, offer a crucial ensemble description of many-body open system dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Casale, Angelo Esposito, Guido Menichetti, Valentina Tozzini</p>
            <p>We present the results of a multi-methodological study aimed at investigating the interaction between graphene and Tritium during its $\beta$-decay to Helium, under different levels of loading and geometrical configurations. We combine Density Functional Theory (DFT), to evaluate the interaction potentials, with calculations of the decay rate, in order to study the consequences that the presence of the substrate has on the $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritium. We determine the shape of the event rate, accounting for the effects of (part of) the corresponding condensed matter degrees of freedom. In the context of future neutrino experiments, our results provide important information aimed at the optimization of hosting material, as well as the determination of the physics reach. Furthermore, our work outlines a novel theoretical and computational scheme to address a question at the boundary between high and low energy physics. This requires non-conventional declinations of DFT combined with full quantum treatments of the nuclear configuration involved in the decay process.</p>

            <p>We present a matrix-product-state-based numerical approach for simulating systems composed of several qubits and a common one-dimensional waveguide. In the presented approach, the one-dimensional waveguide is modeled in real space. Thus, one can use the advantage of matrix-product states that are suited for simulating low-entangled one-dimensional systems. The price to pay is that the vacuum of the waveguide in this modeling becomes the Bogoliubov vacuum, and one has to consider a not-so-small local Hilbert space for bosonic degrees of freedom. To manage the large local Hilbert space, we adopt the recently proposed single-site schemes. We demonstrate the potential of the presented approach by simulating superradiant phenomena within the Hamiltonian dynamics.</p>

We consider static-electric-field shielded polar alkali-metal diatomic molecules and corresponding FL tetramers in their $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$+$\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state. We show that the excited metastable $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$+$\textrm{b}^3\Pi$ electronic manifold supports FL tetramers in a broader range of electric fields with collisional shielding extended to zero field. We calculate the Franck-Condon factors between the ground and excited FL tetramers and show that they are highly tunable with the electric field. We also predict photoassociation of ground-state shielded molecules to the excited FL states in free-bound optical transitions. We propose proof-of-principle experiments to implement stimulated Raman adiabatic passage and photoassociation using FL tetramers, paving the way for the formation of deeply bound ultracold polyatomic molecules.</p>

            <p>Photonic flatbands offer promising light-matter interaction due to their unique slow-light nature. In recent years, flatbands have also attracted significant interest in optical engineering because of their angle-insensitive resonant characteristics. However, to date, no studies have reported the dispersionless behavior of flatbands under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles. Here, we present a two-dimensional photonic flatband created using a silicon metasurface with a Lieb lattice-inspired structure which demonstrates a locally flat photonic band for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light. Employing Fourier imaging, we analyze the energy-momentum dispersion of the flatband metasurface under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles, demonstrating dispersionless flatbands with a change in resonance within $\pm2 nm$ up to $\pm24ô$ or $\pm5ô$, depending on the polarization state and incident angle. This geometry can be adapted for various applications in local field enhancement, enhanced photodetection, and augmented reality displays.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin-Hai Tong, Tomotaka Kuwahara</p>
            <p>Determining when quantum many-body systems admit simple, efficiently simulable structure is a central problem. High-temperature thermal states are a natural candidate for such simplicity, yet for bosons, the unbounded local Hilbert space and energy invalidate the usual expectation that large $T$ guarantees tractability. Here we investigate the resulting complexity boundary for interacting lattice bosons and show that the repulsive Bose--Hubbard class lies on the ``simple'' side. For a family with long-range hopping decaying as $r^{-\alpha}$, we prove convergence of a controlled cluster expansion, which implies (above an explicit temperature threshold) an efficient classical algorithm to approximate the partition function and a rigorous power-law clustering bound for connected correlations. More broadly, our results provide a first step toward charting complexity boundaries for high-temperature bosons and suggest the repulsive Bose--Hubbard class as a natural candidate cusp.</p>

            <p>Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state.

Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as the principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Jie Huang, Alison Warman, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Yanzhu Chen</p>
            <p>In universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, implementing logical non-Clifford gates often demands substantial spacetime resources for many error-correcting codes, including the high-threshold surface code. A critical mission for realizing large-scale quantum computing is to develop simple and resource-efficient implementations of logical non-Clifford gates. We propose a novel way of implementing non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code based on hybrid lattice surgery. First we generalize the standard lattice surgery to hybrid lattice surgery, where operations of rough merge and rough split happen across different topological codes. Then we apply such procedures between Abelian and non-Abelian codes and show that this can provide non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code, in the form of a magic state or a non-Clifford gate teleportation. Complementing this, we provide a continuum topological field theory description of this hybrid lattice surgery utilizing interfaces between (2+1)d topological orders. From these considerations, we can generalize our protocol to non-Clifford gates and magic states at all finite levels of the Clifford hierarchy, as well as gates beyond the hierarchy. We also discuss protocols extending this framework to qutrits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ding Xu, Wen Zhou, Yuxin Du, Junying Zhang, Wei Zhang, Jiangjing Wang</p>
            <p>Indium-tin oxide (ITO) is a crucial functional layer for the optoelectronic applications, such as non-volatile color display thin films based on the ITO/phase-change material (PCM)/ITO/reflective metal multilayer structures on a silicon substrate. In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, thermally induced crystallization may alter the optical properties of ITO layers as well. But the potential change in color of the ITO layers is not considered so far. In this work, we investigate the structural and optical properties of ITO thin films via X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. After thermal annealing at 250 °C, the ITO thin films of 15-100 nm get crystallized with strong changes in refractive index n and extinction coefficient k in the visible light range. However, for the 5-nm ITO thin film, crystallization is only observed after thermal annealing at 350 °C and the change in color is limited upon phase transition. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 °C) and ITO film thickness (5-100 nm). Our work suggests that the intrinsic change in colors of ITO layers should also be considered for the PCM-based reconfigurable display application.</p>

            <p>Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</p>

            <p>Physical properties and functionalities of materials are dictated by global crystal structures as well as local defects. To establish a structure-property relationship, not only the crystallographic symmetry but also quantitative knowledge about defects are required. Here we present a hybrid Machine Learning framework that integrates a physically-constrained variational-autoencoder (pcVAE) with different Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods to systematically accelerate and improve crystal structure refinement with resolution of defects. We chose the pyrochlore structured Ho2Ti2O7 as a model system and employed the GSAS2 package for benchmarking crystallographic parameters from Rietveld refinement. However, the function space of these material systems is highly nonlinear, which limits optimizers like traditional Rietveld refinement, into trapping at local minima. Also, these naive methods don't provide an extensive learning about the overall function space, which is essential for large space, large time consuming explorations to identify various potential regions of interest. Thus, we present the approach of exploring the high Dimensional structure parameters of defect sensitive systems via pretrained pcVAE assisted BO and Sparse Axis Aligned BO. The pcVAE projects high-Dimensional diffraction data consisting of thousands of independently measured diffraction orders into a lowD latent space while enforcing scaling invariance and physical relevance. Then via BO methods, we aim to minimize the L2 norm based chisq errors in the real and latent spaces separately between experimental and simulated diffraction patterns, thereby steering the refinement towards potential optimum crystal structure parameters. We investigated and compared the results among different pcVAE assisted BO, non pcVAE assisted BO, and Rietveld refinement.</p>

            <p>We introduce Grokene, a novel two-dimensional superlattice derived from graphene, which was identified through an AI-guided materials discovery workflow utilizing a large language model. Grokene is predicted to exhibit ambient-pressure, room-temperature superconductivity, with computational simulations revealing a high electron-phonon coupling constant and a substantial logarithmic-averaged phonon frequency (~1650 K), leading to a mean-field critical temperature of approximately 325 K. Full isotropic Eliashberg solutions further support a critical temperature around 310 K, underscoring its strong potential for room-temperature superconductivity. However, the strict two-dimensional nature of Grokene introduces phase fluctuations, limiting the observable superconducting transition to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature of about 120 K in monolayers. To elevate TBKT toward room temperature, strategies such as few-layer stacking, substrate or gate engineering, and optimization of superlattice structure and doping levels are proposed. Our integrated workflow, combining AI-driven materials discovery with advanced many-body theories (DFPT/EPW, Eliashberg, and RPA), provides a systematic and reproducible framework for exploring novel superconductors. We suggest that experimental synthesis and comprehensive characterization of Grokene will be essential to assess these computational predictions and to explore routes toward practical superconductivity under ambient pressure.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</p>

            <p>We study ultrafast magneto-photocurrents in a three-dimensional topological insulator. For this purpose, we excite (In$_r$Bi$_{1-r}$)$_2$Se$_3$ thin films with a femtosecond laser pulse in the presence of an external magnetic field $B_{\text{ext}}$ up to 0.3 T parallel to the film plane. The resulting in-plane photocurrent is measured by detecting the emitted terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulse. It scales linearly with $B_{\text{ext}}$ and is perpendicular to $B_{\text{ext}}$. Strikingly, for $r\ge$4%, we observe an abrupt photocurrent reduction, which is strongly correlated with the Indium-induced quenching of the topological surface states. The rise time, decay time and amplitude of the THz magneto-photocurrent can consistently be explained by a scenario in which optically excited spin-polarized electrons propagate toward the film surface where the accumulated spin is converted into an in-plane charge current due to spin-velocity locking. Our results are highly relevant for contact-free probing of spin-charge conversion in systems with paramagnetic rather than spontaneous magnetic order.</p>

            <p>The photogalvanic effect is the generation of a second-order direct current by illumination of a non-centrosymmetric material. In this work, we develop a fully first-principles quantum kinetic theory based on density matrix formalism to calculate the photogalvanic current in all time regimes: transient and steady. Unlike past \textit{ab-initio} studies which focused only on the photo-excitation process, our first-principles theory framework encodes all quantum scatterings (intra/interband relaxation and electron-hole recombination) mediated by bosons (photons and phonons), and is thus predictive of photogalvanic currents in realistic materials. In particular, for the linear photogalvanic effect, we find electron scatterings mediated by phonons contribute significantly to the shift current for prototypical piezoelectrics like BaTiO$_3$. This explains the theoretical underestimation of the experimental photogalvanic current in previous \textit{ab-initio} work. For the circular photogalvanic effect, we present the first self-consistent theory of a steady injection current that incorporates realistic scattering mediated by phonons. New formulas for the photogalvanic currents are presented which elucidate their connection with fundamental quantum-geometric quantities such as the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. A phonon-based explanation is proposed for the bipolar transient photogalvanic current observed by the THz emission spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>Realizing Chern insulators with Chern numbers greater than one remains a major goal in quantum materials research. Such platforms promise multichannel dissipationless chiral transport and access to correlated phases beyond the conventional C = 1 paradigm. Here, we discover a family of high-Chern-number orbital magnets in twisted monolayer-multilayer rhombohedral graphene, denoted (1+n) with n = 3, 4, and 5. Magnetotransport measurements show pronounced anomalous Hall effects at one and three electrons per moiré unit cell when they are polarized away from the moiré interface. Across the (1+n) systems, we observe a clear topological hierarchy C = n, revealed by the Středa trajectories and the quantized Hall resistance. Our experimental observations are supported by self-consistent mean-field calculations. Moreover, we realize both electrical and magnetic switching of the high-Chern-number states by flipping the valley polarization. Together, these results establish a tunable hierarchy of orbital Chern magnets in twisted rhombohedral graphene, offering systematic control of Chern number and topology through layer engineering in pristine graphene moiré systems.</p>

            <p>Driving non-superconducting materials into a superconducting state through specific modulation is a key focus in the field of superconductivity. Pressure is a powerful method that can switch a three-dimensional (3D) material between non-superconducting and superconducting states. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, strain engineering plays a similar role to pressure. However, purely strain-induced superconductivity in 2D systems remains exceedingly scarce. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting. Surprisingly, the electron-phonon coupling in strained THO-graphene is enhanced strong enough to pair electrons and realize superconductivity, with the highest superconducting transition temperature reaching 45 K. This work not only provides a notable example of controlling metal-superconductor transition in 2D system just via strain, but also sets a new record of superconducting transition temperature for 2D elemental superconductors.</p>

In this study, we demonstrate the existence of topologically protected bound states in the continuum by coupling a finite Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain to a metallic lead. These states are characterized by distinct features in the electrical response of the system, serving as a direct indication of their topological origin. The inherent robustness of such topologically protected states highlights their potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum information processing as well as in the design of advanced electronic and photonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiangteng Liu, Alex Lopez, Zhaoyu liu, Jiun-Haw Chu, Serena Eley</p>
            <p>Superconducting performance is tunable not only via chemical modification or defect engineering, but also through external parameters such as pressure, though this method remains less readily accessible. In this work, we study how compression influences vortex dynamics and critical currents in an iron-based superconductor. Specifically, we perform magnetization measurements using an off-the-shelf pressure cell to investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressures up to 1.08 GPa on the magnetic properties of BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.62}$P$_{0.38}$)$_2$ crystals across a range of temperatures $T$ and magnetic fields $H$. Although these pressures minimally affect the superconducting critical temperature, they produce a clear increase in the critical current density $J_c(T,H)$, a pronounced reduction in the rate of thermally activated vortex motion $S(T,H)$, and can change the dominant vortex pinning mechanism. Furthermore, the effects of pressure are irreversible: after pressurization and subsequent release at room temperature, the crystals retain their enhanced critical current densities. The second magnetization peak vanishes at 22 K after the pressure cycle, which we attribute to a transition from predominantly $\delta \kappa$ pinning to a mixed mechanism of $\delta T_c$ and surface pinning. Lastly, a threefold increase in $J_c$ and more than 40\% reduction in $S$ at 8~K and 0.5~T was achieved after $1-2$ pressure cycles. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of pressure cycling for improving $J_c$, which may offer a simpler alternative to approaches such as chemical doping or the introduction of artificial pinning centers.</p>

            <p>The discovery of LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$ represents a milestone in the quest for room-temperature superconductivity, yet the microscopic mechanism underlying its superior performance remains unclear. Through a comprehensive revisit of theoretical calculations, we uncover a pivotal transition from the anisotropic two-gap superconductivity of LaH$_{10}$ to the isotropic single-gap superconductivity in LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$ upon the introduction of scandium, thereby enhancing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$). This enhancement is rooted in a critical dual role of Sc $3d$ electrons: i) the Sc-derived Jahn-Teller effect promotes hydrogen metallization via the elongation of specific interlayer H-H bonds and enhances electron-phonon coupling (EPC) through the softening of associated phonon modes; ii) Sc $3d$ electrons reconstruct the electronic structure into an MgB$_{2}$-like configuration, generating novel Sc-H-Sc $\sigma$- and $\pi$-bonding states with EPC strengths comparable to LaH$_{10}$. Crucially, the pronounced hybridization between Sc and the hydrogen cages effectively unifies these two contributions on the Fermi surface. This Sc-induced gap unification bridges the high-EPC H-H states with widespread Sc-H states, establishing an isotropic single-gap nature with a large overall EPC strength. Our findings identify this Sc-induced gap unification as the fundamental mechanism for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$, offering a theoretical blueprint for the future design of superior superconducting hydrides.</p>

            <h2>Common sublattice-pure van Hove singularities in the kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs)</h2>

            <p>Kagome materials offer a versatile platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, where van Hove singularities (VHSs) play a pivotal role in driving electronic instabilities, exhibiting distinct behaviors depending on electron filling and interaction settings. In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.</p>

            <p>Spin-triplet superconductivity (SC) offers a unique avenue for realizing non-Abelian Majorana zero modes and thus the fault-tolerant topological quantum computation, and has attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\langle \Delta_{z}\rangle/\langle\Delta_{x(y)}\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Spin Supersolids in Frustrated Quantum Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixuan Huang, Seiji Yunoki, Sadamichi Maekawa</p>
            <p>Recent years have witnessed the emergence of spin supersolids in frustrated quantum magnets, establishing a material-based platform for supersolidity beyond its original context in solid helium. A spin supersolid is characterized by the coexistence of longitudinal spin order that breaks lattice translational symmetry and transverse spin order associated with the spontaneous breaking of a spin U(1) symmetry. Extensive experimental investigations, together with advanced numerical studies, have now revealed a coherent and internally consistent picture of these phases, substantially deepening our understanding of supersolidity in quantum magnetic materials. Beyond their fundamental interest as exotic quantum states, potential applications in highly efficient demagnetization cooling have been supported by a giant magnetocaloric effect observed in candidate materials. Moreover, the possible dissipationless spin supercurrents could open promising perspectives for spin transport and spintronic applications. In this Review, we summarize recent progress on emergent spin supersolids in frustrated triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnets. We survey experimental evidence from thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements and compare these results with theoretical studies of minimal models addressing global phase diagrams, ground state properties, and collective excitations. In addition, we discuss characteristic spin-transport phenomena and outline future directions for exploring spin supersolids as functional quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayan Ghosh, Gourab Roy, Ekta Kushwaha, Mohit Kumar, Tathamay Basu</p>
            <p>Here we have experimentally demonstrated spin-correlation-driven ferroelectric quantum criticality in a prototype quantum spin-liquid system, Ba3CuSb2O9, a quantum phenomenon rarely observed. The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.</p>

We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity that is consistent with the complex phase diagram reported previously for this compound. In particular, in our study we focus on the recently identified magnetic phase in the high-temperature region. We show that while this phase is easily destroyed for magnetic fields applied along [001], it is rather stable for fields along [110]. Furthermore, we introduce a Landau theory and a microscopic toy model describing the elastic response at zero field. We reproduce qualitatively the observed anomalies for different acoustic modes, which allows us to propose a magnetic structure for this new high-temperature phase.</p>

            <h2>Charge disproportionation as a possible mechanism towards polar antiferromagnetic metal in molecular orbital crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Shen, Shuai Qu, Gang Li, Pu Yu, Guang-Ming Zhang</p>
            <p>Polar antiferromagnetic metals have recently garnered increasing interests due to their combined traits of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, the inherently incompatible nature of antiferromagnet, metallicity and polarity pose a significant challenge. We propose that charge disproportionation can lead to this novel state in negative charge transfer gap regime in molecular orbital crystal by molecular orbital analyses of first-principles DFT+$U$ electronic band structure for representative Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer perovskite oxides Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, corroborated by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculation. Due to the negative charge transfer nature of Co$^{4+}$ and imposed by strong interlayer coupling, localized molecular orbitals stemming from the hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals through the apical oxygen $p$ orbitals are preferably emergent within each bilayer unit, which develop antiferromagnetic ordering by invoking Hubbard repulsion. Charge disproportionation driven by Hund's physics, makes an occupation imbalance with broken inversion symmetry in the remaining $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals from distinct Co atoms within the bilayer unit, resulting in the polar metallicity. Meanwhile, this charge disproportionation scenario allows consequent conducting carriers to couple with interlayer local spins via Hund's coupling, giving rise to in-plane double-exchange ferromagnetism. Our molecular orbital formulation further provides a guide towards an effective Hamiltonian for modelling the unconventional synergy of metallicity, polarity and antiferromagnetism in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, which may be a unified framework widely applicable to double-layer Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.E. Bal, N. Deßmann, K. Saeedi, U. Zeitler</p>
            <p>We have developed an experimental setup to simultaneously acquire magneto-transmission spectra and measure the photoconductive response. The low-temperature ($T$=4.2 K) magneto-transmission data for weakly doped InSb in the frequency range 3-15 THz and magnetic fields up to 25 T, shows that the AC conductivity is governed by the classical Drude response. Moreover, the resulting light-induced voltage in this system, consisting of thermoelectric and resistive contributions, both contain features that are related to cyclotron resonances. The frequency dependence of this resonance is in good agreement with $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ perturbation theory and corresponds to transitions between the first and second Landau level with spin-up electrons. The obtained effective mass $m^{*}(B=0)=0.014m_{e}$, is in line with the value extracted from magneto-transmission experiments. Additionally, we can observe evidence of a fluence-dependent metal-insulator transition in the thermoelectric signal, which suggest that the electronic system becomes less sensitive to the light at higher frequencies.</p>

            <h2>Instabilities of the Fractionalized Dirac Semimetal in the Kitaev-Kondo Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jennifer Lin, Frank Krüger</p>
            <p>We study a honeycomb Kondo lattice model in which Dirac conduction electrons are coupled to a spin-1/2 Kitaev quantum spin liquid. For weak Kondo coupling, the spins fractionalize into Majorana fermions comprising a gapless Dirac mode and three gapped visons. Integrating out the visions to second order in the Kondo coupling yields effective electron-electron interactions, including a local Hubbard repulsion, a spin-spin interaction whose sign depends on the Kitaev exchange, and a vertex coupling electrons to Majorana fermions. We analyze the resulting low-energy field theory using a perturbative renormalization group (RG) scheme, accounting for additional density-density interactions generated under RG. At criticality, electrons decouple from Majorana fermions but all three electron interactions acquire positive values. An analysis of susceptibility exponents reveals that the fractionalized Fermi liquid becomes unstable towards antiferromagnetic order and that superconductivity is disfavored.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic stress response kernels for dislocations and cracks: unified anisotropic Lagrangian formulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yves-Patrick Pellegrini, Marc Josien, Martin Chassard</p>
            <p>Elastodynamic cohesive-zone models for defects such as cracks or dislocations (such as the Geubelle-Rice model for cracks, or the Dynamic Peierls Equation for flat-core dislocations), feature the same stress-response convolution kernel in space and time. It accounts for in-plane elastic wave propagation, while its associated instantaneous radiative term accounts for radiative losses in the surrounding medium. These objects are well-known for isotropic elasticity, with their space-time representations involving generalized functions. For anisotropic elasticity they were unknown. The paper presents a derivation using the Stroh formalism. Their Fourier representation rests exclusively on the so-called prelogarithmic Lagrangian factor $L(v)$, while their space-time form involves its derivative $p(v)=L'(v)$, the prelogarithmic impulsion function. A straightforward consequence is the reformulation of the stress in the Weertman model of steadily-moving dislocations in terms of $L(v)$. Special care being paid to the causality constraint, the theory covers indifferently subsonic, intersonic and supersonic regimes of motion. The theory proposed is suitable to phase-field-type Fourier-based numerical codes for planar systems of defects in anisotropic elastodynamics.</p>

            <p>Actin filaments, crosslinkers and myosin molecular motors form contractile networks. For instance, the cell cortex is a thin network below the cell membrane ; contraction of the cell cortex allows cells to round up during cell division. Contractile actin-myosin networks are often represented at large scale by continuous theories such as active gel models. However, experimental perturbations are microscopic while parameters in continuous models are macroscopic, thus making those models hard to falsify experimentally. Here we use numerical simulations, in which we can access both microscopic and macroscopic quantities, to show that active gel models can indeed be applied to describe contractile actin. We predict that contractile stress should scale linearly with actin density, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, we can accurately predict how the contractile stress depends on motor properties such as unloaded speed and stall force.</p>

            <p>The identification, control and theoretical modelling of spin-triplet superconductors (STC) remain a central theme in quantum materials research. Intrinsic STC are rare but offer rich condensate properties and unique surface properties allowing insights into the nature of the spin-triplet order, and promising applications in quantum technologies. Owing to interactions, the order parameter in STCs can often be intertwined with other symmetry breaking orders like charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) or pair density waves (PDW) complicating their phase diagrams. UTe2 stands out as the only known odd-parity, STC that harbors such intertwined orders on the surface and possible topological surface states composed of Majorana fermions. While the (0-11) facet is the most heavily studied, the fermiology of this surface that gives rise to such exotic phenomena is still lacking and continues to be an area of active interest. Here, we employ low-temperature spectroscopic imaging to reveal the Fermi surface of UTe2 through quasiparticle interference. We find scattering originating from the uranium-derived bands that play a major role in the formation of the CDW and the PDW phases. Tunneling spectroscopy further reveals spectral signatures of the CDW gap, corroborating its onset temperature. Suppressing the CDW with a magnetic field, highlights the presence of small, circular Fermi pockets that disperse strongly near the Fermi energy. We discuss the nature of the interference patterns and the origin of the small Fermi pockets in the context of the calculated band structure and the unconventional CDW phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunyao Qi, Heng Lin, Quanfeng Lu, Dong Ruan, Gui-Lu Long</p>
            <p>We propose a disorder-free one-dimensional single-particle Hamiltonian hosting an exact mobility edge (ME), placing the system outside the assumptions of no-go theorems regarding unbounded potentials. By applying a linear Stark potential selectively to one sublattice of a dimerized chain, we generate an effective Hamiltonian with unbounded, staggered hopping amplitudes. The unbounded nature of the hopping places the model outside the scope of the Simon-Spencer theorem, while the staggered scaling allows it to evade broader constraints on Jacobi matrices. We analytically derive the bulk spectrum in reciprocal space, identifying a sharp ME where the energy magnitude equals the inter-cell hopping strength. This edge separates a continuum of extended states from two distinct localized branches: a standard unbounded Wannier-Stark ladder and an anomalous bounded branch accumulating at the ME. The existence of extended states is supported by finite-size scaling of the inverse participation ratio up to system sizes $L \sim 10^9$. Furthermore, we propose an experimental realization using photonic frequency synthetic dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that the ME is robust against potential experimental imperfections, including frequency detuning errors and photon loss, establishing a practical path for observing MEs in disorder-free systems.</p>

            <p>Characterizing magnetic fluctuations is one of the keys to understanding the origin of superconductivity in the spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ which exhibits two superconducting (SC) phases (SC1 and SC2) under pressure: SC1 where a superconducting transition temperature of $T_{\rm c}$ decreases with pressure while $T_{\rm c}$ of SC2 rises with pressure. Previously, D. Ambika et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, L220403 (2022)] have reported the possible coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure from their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. To delve the relationship between the magnetic fluctuations and the two SC phases, we have carried out detailed $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on a single crystal of UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6 K at various pressures ranging from 0 to 2.05 GPa. By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2. Our findings will inspire further study on this material to understand the peculiar SC phases in detail.</p>

            <p>Utilizing a combination of dynamical mean field theory and density functional theory (DMFT/DFT), it has been theoretically proposed that PuB$_6$ is a strongly correlated topological insulator characterized by nontrivial $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ topological invariants and metallic surface states (\textit{X.

Here, we demonstrate through low-temperature magneto-transport measurements and first-principles calculations that PuB$6$ exhibits characteristics of a topological Kondo insulating state. These features include a transition in electrical resistivity from high-temperature, thermally activated behavior with a narrow gap at the Fermi level ($\Delta{\rho} \sim$ 20 meV) to a distinctive low-temperature plateau, as well as a surface-to-volume dependence of electrical resistivity at low temperatures. The topological nature of PuB$_6$ is further supported by the theoretical calculations, which show that GGA+$U$ is capable of capturing electronic, topological, and lattice properties of PuB$_6$ with much lower computational cost than DMFT.</p>

We propose a conditional convolutional neural network to predict the shock-induced temperature field as a function of shock strength, for a wide range of microstructures, and obtained via two different simulation methods. The proposed model, denoted MISTnet2, significantly extends prior work that was limited to a single shock strength, model, and type of microstructure. MISTnet2 can contribute to bridging atomistics with coarse-grain simulations and enable first principles predictions of detonation initiation and safety of this class of materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreya Debnath, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>The exploration of topological and transport properties of collinear antiferromagnets and the role of Kitaev interactions in realising topological states therein have rarely been systematically addressed in literature. In this context, we consider a zigzag-ordered antiferromagnet with both extended Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in presence of an external magnetic field to focus on the topological phases demonstrated by the magnon band structure and validated by the transport properties. The hybridization between the up- and down-spin sectors carries evidences of opening bulk gaps in the magnon band structure, giving rise to nontrivial topological phases characterized by finite Chern numbers, chiral edge modes, and a nonzero thermal Hall conductivity. Furthermore, generally speaking, a finite magnon orbital moment can exist and contribute to the Nernst response even when the net spin moment vanishes owing to the fundamental independence of the spin and orbital magnetizations. This motivates us to investigate the magnon orbital moment, orbital Berry curvature, and the resulting orbital Nernst conductivity associated with the magnon bands. We find that a giant orbital Nernst conductivity emerges even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the distinction between different topological phases is more lucidly manifested via the orbital Nernst conductivity, thereby highlighting an enhanced sensitivity of the orbital transport to the underlying band topology. For completeness, we briefly discuss the scenario corresponding to a Néel-ordered spin alignment, which leads to a vanishing Chern number and consequently suppressed thermal Hall and orbital Nernst conductivities compared to the zigzag-ordered case, even in the presence of DMI and Kitaev interactions.</p>

            <p>Unravelling the complex processes governing battery degradation is critical to the energy transition, yet the efficacy of operando characterisation is severely constrained by a lack of Reliability, Representativeness, and Reproducibility (the 3Rs). Current methods rely on bespoke hardware and passive, pre-programmed methodologies that are ill-equipped to capture stochastic failure events. Here, using the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's multi-modal toolkit as a case study, we expose the systemic inability of conventional experiments to capture transient phenomena like dendrite initiation. To address this, we propose Heuristic Operando experiments: a framework where an AI pilot leverages physics-based digital twins to actively steer the beamline to predict and deterministically capture these rare events. Distinct from uncertainty-driven active learning, this proactive search anticipates failure precursors, redefining experimental efficiency via an entropy-based metric that prioritises scientific insight per photon, neutron, or muon. By focusing measurements only on mechanistically decisive moments, this framework simultaneously mitigates beam damage and drastically reduces data redundancy. When integrated with FAIR data principles, this approach serves as a blueprint for the trusted autonomous battery laboratories of the future.</p>

            <h2>Electrostatics of a finite-thickness conducting cylindrical shell: coupled elliptic-kernel integral equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Ricardo de Sousa</p>
            <p>We develop an exact electrostatic formulation for a finite-length conducting cylindrical shell of finite thickness separating two dielectric media with arbitrary permittivity contrast. The boundary-value problem is reduced to a coupled system of singular integral equations with elliptic kernels governing the induced surface-charge densities on the inner and outer faces. High-accuracy numerical solutions are combined with a systematic asymptotic analysis that elucidates the interplay between geometry, thickness, and dielectric contrast. All classical limiting regimes are recovered, including the slender-body limit, the short-cylinder (ring-like) asymptote, and the thick-shell regime dominated by the outer surface. We demonstrate that the logarithmic short-cylinder behavior of zero-thickness models is a singular feature, which is regularized for any finite thickness, giving rise instead to a finite capacitance plateau. The asymptotic structure of the coupled equations explains both the electrostatic decoupling of the inner cavity in the thick-shell limit and the redistribution of charge between the two surfaces. The results provide exact benchmarks for finite cylindrical conductors, bridging classical analytical treatments and modern numerical approaches, and furnish a high-accuracy reference solution for the validation of axisymmetric electrostatic solvers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose R. Alves, Manfred Lindner, Farinaldo S. Queiroz, Manoel S. Vasconcelos</p>
            <p>Molecular magnets, although analogous to familiar macroscopic magnets, offer a platform for next generation magnetic storage technologies with far higher data densities and prospective applications in quantum information science. When exposed to an external magnetic field, single molecule magnets enter a frustrated magnetic configuration that is exceptionally sensitive to low energy excitations. Energy deposited by a dark matter particle can trigger the relaxation of a metastable molecule, releasing Zeeman energy that subsequently propagates through neighboring molecules. This magnetic avalanche encodes the energy deposited in the initial excitation. By combining concepts from chemistry, condensed matter physics, and particle physics, we show that dysprosium and manganese molecules can achieve more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity to dark photon and QCD axion models, respectively, compared with existing detection methods.</p>

            <h2>Analog Weight Update Rule in Ferroelectric Hafnia, using pico-Joule Programming Pulses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandre Baigol, Nikhil Garg, Matteo Mazza, Yanming Zhang, Elisa Zaccaria, Wooseok Choi, Bert Jan Offrein, Laura Bégon-Lours</p>
            <p>In an effort to compete with the brain's efficiency at processing information, neuromorphic hardware combines artificial synapses and neurons using mixed-signal circuits and emerging memories. In ferroelectric resistive weights, the strength of the synaptic connection between two neurons is stored in the device conductance. During learning, programming pulses are applied to the synaptic weight, which reconfigures the ferroelectric domains and adjusts the conductance. One strategy to lower the energy cost during the training phase is to lower the duration of the programming pulses. However, the latter cannot be shorter than the self-loading time of the resistive weights, limited by intrinsic parasitics in the circuits. In this work, ferroelectric resistive weights are fabricated using a process compatible with CMOS Back-End-Of-Line integration, based on hafnia/zirconia nanolaminates. By laterally scaling the device area under 100 $\mu$m$^2$, the self-loading time becomes sufficiently short to enable 20 ns programming, which corresponds to a maximum of 3 picoJoules per pulse. Further, in this work, the weight update rule with 20 ns pulses is experimentally measured not only for different amplitudes but also for different initial conductance states. We find that the final weight is determined by the pulse amplitude, independent of the initial weight value.</p>

            <h2>Simulating Wigner Localisation with the IBM Heron 2 Quantum Processor: A Proof-of-Principle Benchmarking Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Airat Kiiamov, Dmitrii Tayurskii</p>
            <p>We report on a high-fidelity digital quantum simulation of Wigner localisation in a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) electron system using a 6-qubit segment of the state-of-the-art \textbf{IBM\,Heron\,2} quantum processor. By mapping the Coulomb interaction Hamiltonian onto a 6-qubit ring lattice, we reconstruct the ground-state energy landscape for a 2-electron Wigner dimer across fifteen interaction regimes in the range $U \in [5, 75]$. This study serves as a rigorous \textbf{benchmarking} exercise, translating foundational experimental models originally developed for electrons on liquid helium into the domain of modern quantum computing. Leveraging the enhanced gate fidelity and tunable coupler architecture of the Heron 2, we demonstrate that the digital simulation accurately captures the energy minimisation trends associated with Wigner dimer formation, achieving a relative error below 7\% in the strong-interaction limit. Our results provide a crucial \textbf{proof-of-principle} validation for using superconducting quantum hardware to probe strongly correlated phases of matter with high precision, establishing a baseline for future simulations beyond the classical limit.</p>

            <p>Disorder in quantum many-body systems can drive transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic phases, yet the nature--and even the existence--of these transitions remains intensely debated. Using a two-dimensional array of superconducting qubits, we study an interacting spin model at finite temperature in a disordered landscape, tracking dynamics both in real space and in Hilbert space. Over a broad disorder range, we observe an intermediate non-ergodic regime with glass-like characteristics: physical observables become broadly distributed and some, but not all, degrees of freedom are effectively frozen. The Hilbert-space return probability shows slow power-law decay, consistent with finite-temperature quantum glassiness. In the same regime, we detect the onset of a finite Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the disappearance of spin diffusion. By contrast, at lower disorder, spin transport persists with a nonzero diffusion coefficient. Our results show that there is a transition out of the ergodic phase in two-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Takahashi, Shu Tanaka</p>
            <p>We investigate obtaining intermediate quantum states during the quantum annealing process to address the limitation of the linear weighted sum method in multi-objective optimization, which inherently fails to reach non-convex regions of the Pareto front. We validate this approach through physical experiments utilizing quench-based readout and numerical simulations assuming ideal mid-anneal measurements. Both methods consistently demonstrate a clear trade-off where earlier timing enhances diversity of the solutions, whereas later timing ensures convergence to non-dominated solutions. Notably, a practical compromise timing balances both metrics. The qualitative agreement between practical quench and ideal simulation indicates the potential of accessing the intermediate states for comprehensive Pareto front exploration.</p>

            <p>The excess energy of the one-component plasma fluid is calculated using the variational approach combined with different variants of the excess entropy of the hard-sphere fluid, which is used as a reference system. Our comparison with recent Monte Carlo results for the excess energy of the one-component plasma identifies the Percus-Yevick virial entropy as the most accurate entropy to be used in the variational calculation of this kind. The reason for this and potential developments of the present analysis are briefly discussed. We demonstrate that the original Rosenfeld-Tarazons scaling of the thermal component of the excess energy of the one-component plasma fluid is in excellent agreement with recent Monte Carlo results.</p>

            <h2>Interpretation of Unfair Sampling in Quantum Annealing by Node Centrality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naoki Maruyama, Masayuki Ohzeki</p>
            <p>In applications where multiple optimal solutions are needed, transverse-field quantum annealing (QA) is known to sample degenerate ground states in a strongly biased manner. Despite extensive empirical observations, it remains unclear which features of degenerate ground states are preferentially sampled and why by QA. Here we analyze the final states using degenerate perturbation theory to characterize the preference among them. In this analysis, the adjacency matrix of the graph composed by the ground states naturally emerges, and we can predict the eigenvector centralities (one of the node centralities) are related to the probabilities of these states. We verify this prediction on toy models where degeneracy is lifted at first and second order, and we show that second-order weights encode local barrier information, relating sampling fairness to the flatness of the local energy landscape. Finally, this perspective suggests two practical routes toward fair sampling -- promoting connectivity of the graph and reducing heterogeneity of centralities -- and we illustrate consistency with higher-order drivers and minor-embedding transformations.</p>

            <h2>Critical Phenomena on the Bethe Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rudrajit Banerjee, Nicolas Delporte, Saswato Sen, Reiko Toriumi</p>
            <p>We investigate the critical behavior of a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar field theories on the Bethe lattice (the tree limit of regular hyperbolic tessellations) using both the non-perturbative Functional Renormalization Group and lattice perturbation theory. The family is indexed by the parameter $\zeta \in (0,1]$, which determines the range of the theory via the kinetic term constructed from the graph Laplacian raised to the power $\zeta$. Specifically, $\zeta=1$ is the short-range theory, while $0<\zeta<1$ defines the long-range model. Due to the hyperbolic nature of Bethe lattices, the Laplacian lacks a zero mode and exhibits a spectral gap. We find that upon closing this spectral gap by a modification of the Laplacian, the scalar field theories exhibit novel critical behavior in the form of non-trivial fixed points with critical exponents governed by $\zeta$ and the spectral dimension $d_s=3$. In particular, our analysis indicates the presence of a Wilson-Fisher fixed point for the short range $\zeta =1$ theory. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Ising model on the Bethe lattice is known to exhibit mean-field critical exponents. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first evidence that a scalar $\phi^4$ theory and the discrete Ising model on the same underlying lattice may lie in distinct universality classes.</p>

            <p>In this study, we conducted a theoretical analysis of specific C36 and O@C36 Fullerene isomers, namely those with (D3h, C1, Cs, C2, D2) symmetries, in the gaseous phase using the DFT method at B3LYP/6-31G* level. We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h < C36-C1 < C36-Cs < C36-C2 < C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mayank Sharma, Peter Virnau</p>
            <p>The liquid-vapor critical behavior of water is strongly influenced by both ionic solutes and confinement. Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous NaCl solutions using the TIP4P/2005 water model and the Madrid-2019 ion parameters reveal a systematic increase in the liquid-vapor critical temperature and pressure with salt concentration, consistent with experimental trends. In contrast, confinement between parallel hydrophobic plates leads to a depression of the critical point. The critical temperature was determined from the Binder cumulant crossing in the NVT ensemble, using a recently developed method originally applied to an active Brownian particle system. The reliability of this approach was verified through complementary NPT simulations. We further demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the estimated critical point to the van der Waals cutoff distance, underscoring the importance of properly accounting for long-range interactions. Our framework, which employs and tests an adjusted subbox method, can be readily extended to other critical phenomena, including the liquid-liquid critical point of water.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arisa Ikeda, Akitada Sakurai, Kae Nemoto, Mayu Muramatsu</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</p>

            <h2>Phase transitions in a three dimensional $U(1) \times U(1)$ lattice London superconductor: Metallic superfluid and charge-4e superconducting states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Egil V. Herland, Egor Babaev, Asle Sudbo</p>
            <p>We consider a three-dimensional lattice $U(1) \times U(1)$ and $[U(1)]^N$ superconductors in the London limit, with individually conserved condensates. The $U(1) \times U(1)$ problem, generically, has two types of intercomponent interactions of different characters. First, the condensates are interacting via a minimal coupling to the same fluctuating gauge field. A second type of coupling is the direct dissipationless drag represented by a local intercomponent current-current coupling term in the free energy functional. In this work, we present a study of the phase diagram of a $U(1) \times U(1)$ superconductor which includes both of these interactions. We study phase transitions and two types of competing paired phases which occur in this general model: (i) a metallic superfluid phase (where there is order only in the gauge invariant phase difference of the order parameters), (ii) a composite superconducting phase where there is order in the phase sum of the order parameters which has many properties of a single-component superconductor but with a doubled value of electric charge. We investigate the phase diagram with particular focus on what we call ``preemptive phase transitions.'' These are phase transitions unique to multicomponent condensates with competing topological objects. A sudden proliferation of one kind of topological defects may come about due to a fluctuating background of topological defects in other sectors of the theory. For $U(1) \times U(1)$ theory with unequal bare stiffnesses where components are coupled by a non-compact gauge field only, we study how this scenario leads to a merger of two $U(1)$ transitions into a single $U(1) \times U(1)$ discontinuous phase transition. We also report a general form of vortex-vortex bare interaction potential and possible phase transitions in an $N$-component London superconductor with individually conserved condensates.</p>

            <h2>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Weber</p>
            <p>Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s<1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to explore how this nontrivial fixed-point structure affects the phase diagram and phase transitions of the anisotropic model. In particular, we show how fixed-point annihilation within a symmetry-enhanced critical manifold leads to (i) a continuous order-to-order transition beyond the Landau paradigm, (ii) a symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, and (iii) pseudocriticality, which can be tuned into each other via the bath exponent $s$. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. Moreover, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. We also study the crossover away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase.</p>

Motivated by this natural phenomenon, we experimentally investigate the dynamic evolution of synthetic particles as the liquid surface shrinks in area. Our experiments demonstrate the tendency of particles to aggregate, forming distinct clusters as the liquid boundary shrinks. We systematically examine the emergence of these clusters and explore how their sizes and numbers evolve with changes in packing fraction. We also analyze particle rotation during the process and discuss the formation of the final configuration comprising clusters of various orientations. Complementary numerical simulations demonstrate qualitative agreement with our experimental findings. This study sheds additional light on the self-assembly of macroscopic particles in a dynamically evolving medium.</p>

Finding direct evidence for Kitaev interaction and determining its value has been an essential but formidable challenge in Kitaev physics. Here we report the direct Kitaev interaction signature in magnetic anisotropy measured by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We present measured values of Heisenberg $J$, Kitaev $K$, and off-diagonal symmetric $\Gamma$ exchange interactions in CrX$_3$ determined using FMR and exact diagonalization. $K$ and $\Gamma$ exhibit dominant dependencies on $\lambda_X$, indicating its central role in 2D magnetism.

            <p>We develop a gauge-invariant renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) to reliably find the quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and their field response for realistic Kitaev materials under strong magnetic fields and described by the generalized Kitaev $J$-$K$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model. Remarkably, while our RMFT reproduces previous results based on using more complicated numerical methods, it also predicts several new stable QSL states. In particular, since Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) is no longer a saddle point solution, a new exotic 2-cone state distinct from the KSL, is found to describe experimental observations well, and hence should be the candidate state realized in the Kitaev material, $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We further explore the mechanism for the suppression of the observed thermal Hall conductivity at low temperatures within the fermionic framework, and show that the polar-angle dependence of the fermionic gap can distinguish the found 2-cone state from the KSL state in further experiments.</p>

            <p>Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity near $80$ K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p>

            <p>We develop a theoretical and numerical framework for three-dimensional bulk chiral magnets that includes the full magnetostatic dipole-dipole interaction and its back-reaction on the magnetization. Assuming translational invariance along one spatial direction, we analyze the effect of dipolar interactions on three Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (DMI) terms -- Dresselhaus, Rashba, and Heusler -- corresponding to Bloch, Néel, and antiskyrmion textures. In the absence of the dipolar interaction, these three DMI terms are gauge-equivalent and yield degenerate skyrmion energies. Incorporating the non-local dipole-dipole interaction breaks this degeneracy: Bloch skyrmions remain unaffected, Néel skyrmions shrink slightly, and Heusler antiskyrmions lose axial symmetry and stabilize into square-lattice crystals. The system is solved using a non-local numerical relaxation method that self-consistently computes the magnetostatic potential from Poisson's equation. Our results show that long-range dipolar interactions can stabilize bulk antiskyrmion crystals in translationally invariant three-dimensional chiral magnets.</p>

            <p>We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</p>

            <p>The electromagnetic properties of type-II superconductors depend on vortices -- magnetic flux lines whose motion introduces dissipation that can be mitigated by pinning from material defects. The material disorder landscape is tuned by the choice of materials growth technique and incorporation of impurities that serve as vortex pinning centers. For example, metal organic deposition (MOD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) produce high-quality superconducting films with uncorrelated versus correlated disorder, respectively. Here, we study vortex dynamics in PLD-grown EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing varying concentrations of BaHfO$_3$ inclusions and compare our results with those of MOD-grown (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films. Despite both systems exhibiting behavior consistent with strong pinning theory, which predicts the critical current density $J_c$ based on vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical inclusions, we find striking differences in the vortex dynamics owing to the correlated versus uncorrelated disorder. Specifically, we find that the EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films grown without inclusions exhibit surprisingly slow vortex creep, comparable to the slowest creep rates achieved in (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing high concentrations of BaHfO$_3$. Whereas adding inclusions to (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is effective in slowing creep, BaHfO$_3$ increases creep in EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ even while concomitantly improving $J_c$. Lastly, we find evidence of variable range hopping and that $J_c$ is maximized at the BaHfO$_3$ concentration that hosts creep of large vortex bundles or a Bose glass state.</p>

            <p>Hole spin qubits in Ge/GeSi heterostructures benefit from the clean environment of epitaxial interfaces and from the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling that enables efficient electrical control, which makes them promising candidates for quantum computation. However, spin-orbit coupling also enhances the sensitivity to electrical disorder, potentially increasing variability. In this work, we perform numerical simulations in a realistic device geometry to quantify the variability of the charge and spin properties of Ge qubits induced by charge traps at the SiGe/oxide interfaces. We show that while the variability of charge properties remains moderate, spin properties (g-factors and Rabi frequencies) show significant dispersion. We explore the implications of this variability for large-scale architectures, and provide guidelines to minimize variability both in terms of interface quality requirements and optimal operation strategies.</p>

            <p>NiPS3 is an exfoliable van-der-Waals intralayer antiferromagnet with zigzag-type spin arrangement. It is distinct from other TMPS3 (TM: transition metal) materials by optical excitations into a strongly correlated state that is tied to the magnetic properties. However, the related, fundamental band structure across the antiferromagnetic phase transition has not been probed yet. Here, we use angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with {\mu}m resolution in combination with DFT+U calculations for that purpose. We identify a characteristic band shift across TN. It is attributed to bands of mixed Ni and S character related to the superexchange interaction of Ni 3t2g orbitals. Moreover, we find a structure above the valence band maximum with little angular dispersion that could not be reproduced by the calculations. The discrepancy suggests the influence of many-body interactions beyond the DFT+U approximations in striking contrast to the results on MnPS3 and FePS3, where these calculations were sufficient for an adequate description.</p>

            <h2>Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Archisman Panigrahi, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Identification of Critical Transitions via Flow Matching: A Scalable Generative Approach for Many-Body Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian-Rui Lee, Daw-Wei Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching (FM) to identify critical properties in many-body systems efficiently. Using the 2D XY model as a benchmark, we demonstrate that a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, effectively generalizes across both temperature and system size. This dual generalization enables two primary applications for large-scale computational physics: (i) a rapid "train-small, predict-large" strategy to locate phase transition points for significantly larger systems ($128\times 128$) without retraining, facilitating efficient finite-size scaling analysis; and (ii) the fast generation of high-fidelity, decorrelated initial spin configurations for large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, providing a robust starting point that bypasses the long thermalization times of traditional samplers. These capabilities arise from the combination of the Flow Matching framework, which learns stable probability-flow vector fields, and the inductive biases of the U-Net architecture that capture scale-invariant local correlations. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient tool for exploring the thermodynamic limit, serving as both a rapid explorer for phase boundaries and a high-performance initializer for high-precision studies.</p>

            <p>We apply Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)-a dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians coupled to entropy-induced dissipation-to paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium systems. Concretely, we construct NNET realizations for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction (oscillatory), the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model (spiking), and the Lorenz and Chen systems (chaotic), and analyze their dynamical and thermodynamic signatures. Across all cases the velocity field cleanly decomposes into a reversible Nambu part and an irreversible entropygradient part, anchored by a model-independent quasi-conserved quantity. This construction reproduces cycles, spikes, and strange-attractor behavior and clarifies transitions among steady, periodic, and chaotic regimes via cross-model diagnostics. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a unified, quantitatively consistent framework for oscillatory, spiking, and chaotic non-equilibrium systems, offering a systematic description beyond the scope of linear-response theories such as Onsager's relations or GENERIC.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of the symmetry constraint in a Floquet topological insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>A topological insulator is regarded as an ideal candidate for information storage and high-speed lossless electrical transmission devices due to robust topological protected boundary modes. Previous studies revealed that symmetry exerts an unbreakable constraint on the existence, classes, and orders of its boundary modes. It severely limits the controllability and application of a topological insulator. Here, we propose a Floquet-engineering method to break this symmetry-imposed constraint on a topological insulator. By applying periodic driving on a system belonging to a symmetry class that prohibits the existence of first-order topological phases, we find that rich first-order boundary modes are created. Interestingly, exotic hybrid-order topological insulators with coexisting first-order helical boundary modes and second-order corner modes not only in two different quasienergy gaps but also in one single gap are generated easily by periodic driving. Refreshing the prevailing understanding of symmetry constraint on topological phases, our result opens an avenue for the creation of exotic topological insulators without altering symmetries. It greatly expands the scope of the fabricated materials that host topological insulators.</p>

            <p>We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.</p>

            <p>We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</p>

            <p>Liquid-liquid phase separation is important across biology, physics, and materials science. Although usually studied at equilibrium, active components - such as motor proteins, enzymes, and synthetic microswimmers - are increasingly recognized as key players in reshaping phase separation dynamics. Here, we encapsulate motile bacteria inside phase-separated aqueous droplets to investigate how internal activity alters interfacial behavior. By varying bacterial density, we control the active stress at the droplet interface. At low activity, we observe scale-dependent interfacial fluctuations that propagate as waves. In this low Reynolds number regime, these waves arise from an effective inertial response, generated when active bacterial stresses balance passive viscous damping of the interface. At higher activity, droplets deform strongly - exceeding the Plateau-Rayleigh instability threshold - and even form cell-sized filaments - a morphology without a passive counterpart. Enhanced droplet motility and accelerated coarsening accompany these shape changes. Our work shows how active stresses can reshape the morphology and dynamics of multiphase systems, offering new insight into the physics of internally driven phase-separated fluids.</p>

            <p>Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its central role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Building on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable~\cite{zhouIncremental2024,zhangIntegral2024,liaoExtracting2024}, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner of EE at QCPs in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction. Turning on this interaction allows us to trace an Ising critical line, reaching the tricritical point, and then a line of first-order phase transition. In (2+1)d, the tricritical point is described by the Gaussian theory, where a theoretical calculation of the corner logarithmic term in the 2nd Rényi entropy term is available~\cite{UniversalCasini2007}. Our QMC results are in quantitative agreement with this theoretical value, providing a highly nontrivial benchmark of the algorithm. Furthermore, we also study the Rényi EE at the Ising critical line and on the first-order transition line, obtaining results consistent with theoretical expectations. These findings establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michał Łepek, Agata Fronczak, Piotr Fronczak</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magnus F Ivarsen</p>
            <p>Recent minimalist modeling indicates that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that polar alignment on the unit sphere is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics, and that the two-dimensional Kuramoto coupling term naturally appears in the tangent-plane projection of spin relaxation. This constraint generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. Our results show that all polar chiral agents who seek to align on the unit sphere strictly constitute a dissipative spintronic fluid, where phase gradient transport is ensured by the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</p>

            <p>Thin-film transistors based on amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) are promising candidates for enabling further DRAM scaling and 3D integration, which are critical for advanced computing. Despite extensive research, the charge transport mechanism in these disordered semiconductors remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate charge transport in the archetypical AOS material, indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), across a range of compositions and temperatures using thin-film transistors and Hall bar structures. Our results show that the electrons involved in transport exhibit partially spatial coherence and non-degenerate conduction. Under these conditions, transport is dominated by electron transfer across insulating gaps between locally coherent regions, rather than by degenerate percolative transport above a mobility edge, or by localized-state hopping, both of which are widely assumed in the literature. While fluctuation-induced tunnelling has previously been invoked to describe low-temperature transport in oxide transistors, we show that such behavior originates from partially coherent electronic states and develop a field-effect-aware fluctuation-induced tunnelling (FEAFIT) framework that explicitly accounts for gate modulation of the tunneling landscape. The FEAFIT model accurately predicts experimental data across all compositions, temperatures, and gate voltages, enabling extraction of fundamental transport parameters. These tunnelling parameters are then correlated with electron coherence dimensions and the degree of energetic disorder obtained from first-principles calculations. Our findings advance the fundamental understanding of charge transport in AOS-based transistors and provide a foundation for further performance improvements</p>

            <p>Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</p>

            <p>We examine the reduction of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) size under an external magnetic field within a classical nucleation theory framework combined with a sphere-packing description of atomic assembly. The model incorporates magnetic free-energy contributions arising from the coupling between the applied field and the magnetic susceptibility of the nucleating material, yielding a closed-form relation between nanoparticle radius and field strength. Our approach reproduces the experimentally observed decrease in the most-probable particle radius from approximately 170 nm at 49.27 mT when the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the stirring plane, and to 155 nm at 180.78 mT in the perpendicular configuration. Across the investigated field range, the theoretical predictions remain consistent with experimental measurements obtained under continuous mechanical stirring, supporting the interpretation that the observed size reduction originates from a magnetic-field-induced modification of the nucleation free-energy landscape. Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the results provide a physically transparent and computationally efficient framework for understanding magnetic-field-controlled nanoparticle size selection.</p>

            <p>The complete, nonperturbative content of random matrix models is described by resurgent-transseries -- general solutions to their corresponding string-equations. These transseries include exponentially-suppressed multi-instanton amplitudes obtained by eigenvalue tunneling, but they also contain exponentially-enhanced and mixed instanton-like sectors with no known matrix model interpretation. This work shows how these sectors can be also described by eigenvalue tunneling in matrix models -- but on the non-physical sheet of the spectral curve describing their large-N limit. This picture further explains the full resurgence of random matrices via analysis of all possible eigenvalue integration-contours. How to calculate these "anti" eigenvalue-tunneling amplitudes is explained in detail and in various examples, such as the cubic and quartic matrix models, and their double-scaling limit to Painleve I. This further provides direct matrix-model derivations of their resurgent Stokes data, which were recently obtained by different techniques.</p>

            <p>The geometric properties of quantum states are crucial for understanding many physical phenomena in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and optics. The central object describing these properties is the quantum geometric tensor, which unifies the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. In this work, we use the differential-geometric framework of vector bundles to analyze the properties of parameter-dependent quantum states and generalize the quantum geometric tensor to this setting. This construction is based on a general connection on a Hermitian vector bundle, which defines a notion of quantum state transport in parameter space, and a sub-bundle projector, which constrains the set of accessible quantum states. We show that the sub-bundle geometry is similar to that of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry and is described by generalized Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations. This leads to a novel definition of the quantum geometric tensor that contains an additional curvature contribution. To illustrate our results, we describe the sub-bundle geometry arising in the semiclassical treatment of Dirac fields propagating in curved spacetime and show how the quantum geometric tensor, with its additional curvature contributions, is obtained in this case. As a concrete example, we consider Dirac fermions confined to a hyperbolic plane and demonstrate how spatial curvature influences the quantum geometry. This work sets the stage for further exploration of quantum systems in curved geometries, with applications in both high-energy physics and condensed matter systems.</p>

            <p>We evaluate the conditions for surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space subjected to large deformations and a magnetic field. After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios.

            <h2>Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaotian Zhang, Yue Shang, Entao Yang, Ge Zhang</p>
            <p>Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.</p>

            <h2>High-Sensitivity Photonic Crystal Biosensors using Topological Light Trapping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengzheng Zhai, Sajeev John</p>
            <p>Photonic crystals (PCs) with localized optical cavity modes arising from topological domain-wall line defects are simulated for optical biosensing by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. These consist of a square lattice of square silicon blocks with a significant photonic band gap (PBG). Optical transmission through the PBG at specific frequencies occurs by defect-mediated optical tunneling. Biofluid flows perpendicular to light propagation, through a channel containing the PC, defined by silica side-walls and an underlying silica substrate. Replacing the silicon blocks with thin silicon strips throughout the domain-wall region, analyte binding coincides with regions of maximal field intensity. As a result, the sensitivity is improved by almost 16 times higher than the previous designs. We analyze optical mode hybridization of two nearby domain walls and its close relation to the transmission-levels and correlations in frequency shifts of nearby optical resonances in response to analyte-bindings. We illustrate three high-sensitivity chips each with three domain-wall defects, all of which can distinguish three analyte-bindings and their combinations completely in a single spectroscopic measurement. In a photonic crystal, consisting of silicon squares embedded in a water background and a 5-micron lattice spacing, the biosensor sensitivity to a thin analyte binding layer is nearly 3000 nm/RIU, and to the overall background biofluid is over 8000 nm/RIU.</p>

            <h2>Fidelity zeros and Lee-Yang theory of quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian-Yi Gu, Gaoyong Sun</p>
            <p>Lee-Yang theory is central to the analysis of thermal phase transitions. However, the underlying mechanism of the theory and the nature of Lee-Yang zeros in quantum many-body systems remains elusive. Here, we develop a unified framework for understanding quantum phase transitions from fidelity zeros induced by symmetry breaking. These zeros, arising from transitions between symmetry sectors, obey the Lee-Yang theorem and give rise to fidelity edges near critical points. Quantum criticality is further characterized through the finite-size scaling of fidelity zeros. As concrete examples, we analytically and numerically investigate fidelity zeros in one- and two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising models under a complex magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of Lee-Yang theory and open avenues for exploring unexplored landscapes of phase transitions in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Henriksson, Stefanos R. Kousvos, Jasper Roosmale Nepveu</p>
            <p>The renormalization of composite operators is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, relevant for the description of phase transitions and high energy phenomenology. We calculate the anomalous dimensions of a large set of operators in any scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions, up to five loops in most cases. The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT). As an EFT application, we extract the five-loop renormalization group (RG) equations of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model EFT at dimension six, and up to two loops at dimension eight, aligning our operator basis with custodial symmetry violation. Additionally, for CFT, by resumming the $\varepsilon$-expanded results at the fixed-point, we determine the entire low-lying spectrum (i.e. up to dimension six and Lorentz rank two) of the Ising, $O(n)$ and hypercubic scalar CFTs. Our work enables future conformal bootstrap studies for numerous theories of interest. We include introductions to EFT and CFT, and we illustrate our method and the structure in RG mixing matrices in several illuminating examples, which may also be of general interest. All results in the general theory are publicly available and we describe a systematic path towards applying them to more complicated CFTs.</p>

            <h2>Pauli stabilizer formalism for topological quantum field theories and generalized statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yitao Feng, Hanyu Xue, Ryohei Kobayashi, Po-Shen Hsin, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) provides a unifying framework for describing topological phases of matter and for constructing quantum error-correcting codes, playing a central role across high-energy physics, condensed matter, and quantum information. A central challenge is to formulate topological order on lattices and to extract the properties of topological excitations from microscopic Hamiltonians. In this work, we construct new classes of lattice gauge theories as Pauli stabilizer models, realizing a wide range of TQFTs in general dimensions. We develop a lattice description of extended excitations and systematically determine their generalized statistics. Our main example is the (4+1)D fermionic-loop toric code, obtained by condensing the $e^2m^2$-loop in the (4+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code. We show that the loop excitation exhibits fermionic loop statistics: the 24-step loop-flipping process yields a phase of $-1$. Our Pauli stabilizer models realize all twisted 2-form gauge theories in (4+1)D, the higher-form Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT classified by $H^5(B^2G,U(1))$. Beyond (4+1)D, the fermionic-loop toric codes form a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in arbitrary dimensions, realized as explicit Pauli stabilizer codes using $\mathbb{Z}_4$ qudits. Finally, we develop a Pauli-based framework that defines generalized statistics for extended excitations in any dimension, yielding computable lattice unitary processes to detect nontrivial statistics. For example, we propose anyonic membrane statistics in (6+1)D, as well as fermionic membrane and volume statistics in arbitrary dimensions. We construct new families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders: the fermionic-membrane toric code and the fermionic-volume toric code. In addition, we demonstrate that $p$-dimensional excitations in $2p+2$ spatial dimensions can support anyonic $p$-brane statistics for only even $p$.</p>

            <p>As quantum dot (QD)-based spin qubits advance toward larger, more complex device architectures, rapid, automated device characterization and data analysis tools become critical. The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.</p>

            <p>Polymer electrolytes incorporating Li$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) nanoparticles show promise for solid-state lithium batteries owing to their enhanced ionic conductivity, though the governing mechanisms remain unclear. We combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, experimental ionic conductivity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the effect of LGPS loading on polyethylene oxide (PEO) structure and Li-ion transport. MD and experimental results agree up to 10\% LGPS, showing a volcano-shaped conductivity trend driven by polymer segmental dynamics and interfacial effects. Beyond 10\%, experiments reveal additional conductivity enhancement unexplained by MD, suggesting a distinct transport regime. DFT calculations indicate that Li-ion migration at the PEO|LGPS interface proceeds via vacancy-mediated hopping, with low barriers favored by S-rich interfacial sites and hindered by Ge. These findings link interfacial chemistry and microstructure to Li-ion dynamics, offering guidelines for designing high-performance composite polymer electrolytes.</p>

            <h2>Topological physics in quantum critical systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Jia Yu, Limei Xu, Hai-Qing Lin</p>
            <p>Topology forms a cornerstone in modern condensed matter and statistical physics, offering a new framework to classify the phases and phase transitions beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, it is widely believed that topological properties are destroyed when the bulk energy gap closes, making it highly nontrivial to consider topology in gapless quantum critical systems. To address these challenges, recent advancements have sought to generalize the notion of topology to systems without a bulk energy gap, including quantum critical points and critical phases, collectively referred to as gapless symmetry-protected topological states. Extending topology to gapless quantum critical systems challenges the traditional belief in condensed matter physics that topological edge states are typically tied to the presence of a bulk energy gap. Furthermore, it suggests that topology plays a crucial role in classifying quantum phase transitions even if they belong to the same universality class, fundamentally enriching the textbook understanding of phase transitions. Given its importance, here we give a pedagogical review of the current progress of topological physics in quantum critical systems. We introduce the topological properties of quantum critical points and generalize them to stable critical phases, both for noninteracting and interacting systems. Additionally, we discuss further generalizations and future directions, including higher dimensions, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and realizations in modern experiments.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic Helicity Locking of Bloch Skyrmions in Centrosymmetric Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayaseelan Dhakshinamoorthy, Hitesh Chhabra, Ajaya K Nayak</p>
            <p>Magnetic skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials exhibit Bloch-type spin textures with degenerate helicity states due to the absence of Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI), resulting in random nucleation and uncontrolled chirality. Here, we present a comprehensive micromagnetic study demonstrating a fully DMI free strategy for deterministic helicity control by interfacing ferromagnetic (FM) stripes or notch structures with centrosymmetric magnetic (CM) films. We first show that a geometrically constrained configuration comprising two FM stripes with opposite in-plane magnetizations stabilizes skyrmions with a selected helicity, either clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW). We further extend this concept to achieve deterministic nucleation of CW or CCW skyrmions using current pulses applied to an FM notch patterned on the CM film. The combined effects of the FM stripe/notch geometry and interfacial exchange coupling generate dipolar fields that lift the helicity degeneracy, enabling controlled formation of skyrmions with fixed chirality. These results establish FM/CM heterostructures as a robust, DMI-free platform for deterministic generation and guided motion of helicity-locked skyrmions, opening new pathways for advanced spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for the suppression of the hybrid skin-topological effect by fragile topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianrui Liu</p>
            <p>Topological insulators are well-known for their topological edge states, which are protected by the non-trivial bulk topology and characterized by gapless Wannier bands, a phenomenon known as the bulk-boundary correspondence. However, fragile topology challenged this concept, the Wannier bands are gapped, but the edge states still exist with similar protection. Previous studies on fragile topology have primarily focused on the spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions, but the discussion on the physical interpretation of the Wannier gap is limited. In this study, we introduce a bilayer breathing honeycomb lattice with spiral interlayer couplings inside the unit cell. As we increase the interlayer coupling strength, the Wannier gap increases monotonically and the bandgap first increases then decreases. After introducing a gain-loss domain wall, the hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) emerges, and the topological edge states under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) change into corner states under the open boundary condition (OBC) associated with the significant spectral difference. HSTE is suppressed as the interlayer coupling strength increases, the spectral difference between the two boundary conditions has an overall decreasing trend, which more closely mirrors the evolution of the inverse of the Wannier gap. Moreover, some of the corner states transform into edge states. Our work first provides evidence for the relation between fragile topology and HSTE, shedding new insights into the underlying mechanism of Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE).</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity in the kagome Hubbard model under the flat-band-preserving disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jicheol Kim, Dong-Hee Kim</p>
            <p>We investigate the disordered flat-band superconductivity within the attractive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by contrasting the flat-band-preserving disorder [Phys. Rev. B 98, 235109 (2018)] with the random hopping disorder that breaks the flat-band degeneracy. Through Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field calculations, we find that the superfluid weight is much more robust under the flat-band-preserving disorder, while the system eventually undergoes a transition to an insulator as disorder becomes strong enough. The almost linear interaction-dependence of the superfluid weight in the weak coupling limit found with the flat-band-preserving disorder confirms the persistent flat-band signature, whereas the exponential behavior of a dispersive-band character arises with the random hopping counterpart. In addition, in the exact diagonalization of the one-particle density matrix, we identify an occupation spectrum structure attributed to the flat-band states, demonstrating the connection between the resilient flat band and the enhanced robustness of superconductivity.</p>

            <p>The interplay among electronic nematicity, charge density wave, and superconductivity in correlated electronic systems has induced extensive research interest. Here, we discover the existence of nematic fluctuations in TiSe2 single crystal and investigate its evolution with Cu intercalation. It is observed that the elastoresistivity coefficient mEg exhibits a divergent temperature dependence following a Curie-Weiss law at high temperature. Upon Cu intercalation, the characteristic temperature T* of nematic fluctuation is progressively suppressed and becomes near zero when the superconductivity is optimized. Further intercalation of Cu leads to the sign change of T* and the suppression of superconductivity. These results strongly indicate that nematic phase transition may play a vital role in enhancing superconductivity in CuxTiSe2. Therefore, CuxTiSe2 provides a unique material platform to explore the nematic-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity.</p>

In addition, using SHG microscopy, we show that BiTeI displays a distinctive SHG spatial texture consisting of thread-like regions of reduced harmonic intensity. These features demark the boundaries between phase and anti-phase polar domains, confirmed via piezoresponse force microscopy and are attributable to disorder-driven restoration of inversion symmetry and concomitant optical interference effects. Our results unveil the power of polarization-resolved SHG microscopy in elucidating the intricate relationship between structure, symmetry, and nonlinear optical responses in polar vdW materials and highlight the promise of BiTeX as a material platform for domain-engineered nanoscale nonlinear photonics.</p>

            <p>Optical excitation of large-amplitude apical oxygen phonon oscillations has been shown to renormalize the electronic properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, inducing a superconducting-like optical response above equilibrium $T_C$. All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into a superconducting-like inductive response. This assignment was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report an experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties, which has so far been elusive due to the high equilibrium reflectivity and the need to evaluate minute changes in the optical response. We report the appearance of a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2\Delta\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, both consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.</p>

In addition, the phase space over which the topological Anderson insulator exists can be enhanced by breaking up a single disordered patch into multiple smaller patches with the same total amount of disorder.

We recover the infinite $U$ and Kondo limit actions from our approach and show that the Kondo resonance already develops in the normal state when the slave boson has yet to condense. We show that the slave rotor and $s$-boson have the same algebraic structure, and we establish a unified functional integral framework connecting the $s$-boson and slave rotor representations for the single impurity Anderson model.</p>

            <p>We study random walks evolving in continuous time on a one-dimensional lattice where each site $x$ hosts a quenched random potential $U_x$. The potentials on different sites are independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables. We analyze three distinct models that specify how the transition rates depend on $U_x$: the random-force-like model, random walks with randomized stepping times, and the Gaussian trap model. Our analysis focuses on five key disorder-dependent quantities defined for a finite chain with $N$ sites: the probability current, its reciprocal (the resistance), the splitting probability, the mean first-passage time $T_N$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_N$ in a periodic chain. By determining the moments of these random variables, we demonstrate that the probability current, resistance, and splitting probability are not self-averaging, which leads to pronounced differences between their average and typical behaviors. In contrast, $T_N$ and $D_N$ become self-averaging when $N \to \infty$, though they exhibit strong sample-to-sample fluctuations for finite $N$.</p>

A Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE)-based algorithm is developed to enumerate SAWs on both 2D and 3D lattices. In case of 2D square lattice, SAWs up to N=71 steps are successfully enumerated within 26.9 minutes - significantly improving upon the classical algorithm, which required approximately 231 hours(Jensen et al., 2012, J.

The algorithm is further extended to 3D cubic lattices, where SAWs up to N=40 steps are enumerated in 13.06 minutes, compared to the classical result of N=36 in 250 hours (Schram et al., 2011, J.

As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched Néel state from Rényi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental Rényi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and Rényi relative entropies.</p>

Starting from a quasi-conservative Gross-Pitaevskii model, we show that nonlinear dispersive shock waves naturally generate spatial regions where the local flow velocity exceeds the speed of sound, creating a self-induced transonic interface that functions as an acoustic horizon. Unlike previous schemes relying on externally engineered potentials or pump-loss landscapes, our approach reveals that the intrinsic nonlinear hydrodynamics of polariton fluids alone can lead to horizon formation. Using Whitham modulation theory and numerical simulations, we characterize the transition between subsonic and supersonic regimes and estimate the corresponding surface gravity and Hawking temperature. This mechanism opens a new route toward realizing polariton black holes and studying analogue gravitational effects, including Hawking-like emission, in Bose-Einstein quantum liquids.</p>

In this work, we employ energy-resolved transient reflectance microscopy (TRM) combined with the dispersion relation of EPs to achieve high-resolution imaging of EP transport at specific k//. This approach directly reveals the quasi-ballistic transport and ultrafast relaxation of EPs in different k// regions, showcasing diffusion as fast as ~490 cm2/s and a relaxation time of ~95.1 fs. Furthermore, by tuning the detuning parameter, we manipulate the ballistic transport group velocity and relaxation time of EPs across varying k//.

            <h2>Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states of exciton condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SeongJin Kwon, Kyung-Hwan Jin, Jong Eun Han, Siwon Lee, ChoongJae Won, Sang-Wook Cheong, Han Woong Yeom</p>
            <p>Quantum condensed states in solids often reveal their fundamental nature via interactions with impurities, as epitomized by Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states at magnetic impurities in superconductors. Although analogous YSR bound states were predicted within quantum condensates of excitons several decades ago, their existence has been elusive. Here, we directly visualize in-gap electronic states bound to impurities inside an exciton condensate phase of a van der Waals crystal Ta2Pd3Te5, utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We find that the energies of in-gap states are strongly correlated with the excitonic band gap, which is systematically tuned by local strain and carrier injection. Our theoretical analyses reveal that these in-gap states are induced by charge dipoles associated with Ta vacancies through a charge-exciton version of the YSR mechanism. Our findings establish both the YSR physics in exciton condensates and a novel microscopic tool to probe and control quantum properties in exciton condensates persisting up to room temperature.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in quantum simulations have opened access to the real-time dynamics of lattice gauge theories, providing a new setting to explore how quantum criticality influences thermalization and ergodicity far from equilibrium. Using QuEra's programmable Rydberg atom array, we map out the dynamical phase diagram of the spin-1/2 U(1) quantum link model in one spatial dimension by quenching the fermion mass. We reveal a tunable regime of ergodicity breaking due to quantum many-body scars, manifested as long-lived coherent oscillations that persist across a much broader range of parameters than previously observed, including at the equilibrium phase transition point. We further analyze the electron-positron pairs generated during state preparation via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which strongly affect the post-quench dynamics. Our results provide new insights into nonthermal dynamics in lattice gauge theories and establish Rydberg atom arrays as a powerful platform for probing the interplay between ergodicity breaking and quantum criticality.</p>

            <h2>Hedgehog lattices induced by chiral spin interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Mays, Predrag Nikolić</p>
            <p>We analyze a classical Heisenberg spin model on the simple cubic lattice which is invariant under time reversal and contains multiple chiral spin interactions. The modelled dynamics is appropriate either for local moments coupled to itinerant Weyl electrons, or localized electrons with a strong spin-orbit coupling that would produce a Weyl spectrum away from half filling. Using a Monte Carlo method, we find a robust $4Q$ bipartite lattice of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs which melts through a first order phase transition at a critical temperature in certain segments of the phase diagram. The density of hedgehogs is a non-linear function of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and a linear function of the multiple-spin chiral interaction which plays the fundamental role of a ``magnetic flux'' or a hedgehog chemical potential. These findings are related to the observations of hedgehog lattices in MnGe, MnSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ and SrFeO$_3$, and indirectly support the possible existence of incompressible quantum-disordered hedgehog liquids.</p>

            <h2>Many-electron characterizations of higher-charge superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Hao Dong, Yi Zhang</p>
            <p>The theoretical understanding of conventional superconductivity as the phonon-assisted formation and condensation of two-electron Cooper pairs is a significant triumph in condensed matter physics. Here, we propose many-electron characterizations of higher-charge superconductivity with Cooper pairs consisting of more than two electrons, by implementing translation symmetrization on parent pair-density-wave-ordered states. In particular, we demonstrate many-electron constructions with vanishing charge-2e sectors, but with sharp signatures in charge-4e or charge-6e expectation values instead. Such characterizations are consistent with previous phenomenology of vestigial order and Ginzburg-Landau theory, yet, instead of point-group-symmetry presumptions, we show that momentum conservation is both vital and sufficient. Our study thus offers a novel, general, and microscopic route to understand and characterize higher-charge superconductivity, including nontrivial experimental signatures such as fractional magnetic flux and period in interferometry, as well as localized Cooper pairs at lattice topological defects.</p>

            <p>Monophasic MgFe$_2$O$_4$ nanoparticles synthesized by a simple autocombustion method were assessed as magnetically recoverable catalysts for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) in water. The NPs exhibit a crystallite size of $\sim$ 9 nm, a band gap of $\sim$ 2.11 eV, and soft ferrimagnetic behavior, enabling efficient photocatalytic and Fenton-like activity. The effects of irradiation, H$_2$O$_2$ concentration, agitation mode, catalyst loading, and exposure time were systematically evaluated. Rapid and complete MB discoloration was achieved within minutes in the presence of H$_2$O$_2$, even without illumination, indicating that the process is dominated by a surface-mediated heterogeneous Fenton-like mechanism rather than photocatalysis. Kinetic analysis reveals pseudo-first-order behavior, with rate constants governed by the combined effects of catalyst concentration, oxidant dosage, and dye concentration. Structural stability and excellent recyclability confirm the robustness of the catalyst. These findings position MgFe$_2$O$_4$ nanoparticles as a low-cost, efficient, and reusable material for sustainable wastewater under operationally simple conditions.</p>

            <h2>Visualizing the dispersions of Fermi polaron and molecule via spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tingting Shi, Xiaoling Cui</p>
            <p>We propose to measure the dispersions of Fermi polaron and molecule by engineering spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the impurity, which induces spin flip with finite momentum transfer. The polaron dispersion can be probed at small SOC momentum from the linear response of impurity spin. For molecule, we show that it can be prepared through an adiabatic steady-state evolution when setting SOC momentum as the Fermi momentum of majority bath. By gradually reducing SOC strength to zero, the steady state smoothly evolves to a molecular state with directional symmetry breaking. The corresponding dispersion can then be probed experimentally through the center-of-mass momentum distribution of molecules at finite density. Our scheme reveals a fundamental momentum difference between Fermi polaron and molecule, thereby offering a clear physical picture for their first-order transition in single-impurity system.</p>

            <p>We investigate the topological properties of modified Dirac Hamiltonians with an altermagnetic mass term and reveal a novel mechanism for realizing altermagnetic Weyl semimetals. Unlike the conventional Wilson mass, the altermagnetic mass drives direct transitions between nontrivial Chern phases of opposite sign and fundamentally reshapes the band inversion surface. By extending this framework to three dimensions, we construct a minimal lattice model that hosts pairs of Weyl nodes as well as coexisting helical Fermi arcs with opposite chirality on the same surface, which is a phenomenon not found in conventional magnetic Weyl semimetals. We further propose a practical scheme to realize these phases in multilayer structures of 2-dimensional Rashba metal with engineered $d$-wave altermagnetic order. Our results deepen the theoretical understanding of mass terms in Dirac systems and provide concrete guidelines for the experimental detection and realization of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haiyan Lu</p>
            <p>We investigate the electronic structure of americium (Am) across its four experimentally confirmed high-pressure phases Am-I (P63/mmc), Am-II (Fm-3m), Am-III (Fddd), and Am-IV (Pnma) up to 100 GPa, using density functional theory combined with embedded dynamical mean-field theory. Our results successfully reproduce the prominent localized 5f peak observed in ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy around -2.8 eV below the Fermi level in the Am-I phase. While 5f electrons in Am-I and Am-II remain strongly localized, those in Am-III and Am-IV manifest discernible signatures of increased hybridization: a noticeable shift of spectral weight toward the Fermi level, enhanced hybridization strength, and the emergence of distinct multi-peak structures. These changes indicate that 5f electrons begin to participate in bonding and undergo partial delocalization under pressure. Nevertheless, the spectral weight of 5f electrons near the Fermi level in Am-IV remains relatively low, indicating that, compared to U and Pu, Am retains stronger localized 5f electrons even under high pressure. Analysis of the electronic configurations reveals pressure-enhanced valence state fluctuation, characterized by the mixing of 5f5, 5f6, and 5f7 electronic configurations. The X-ray absorption branching ratio further shows that the angular-momentum coupling scheme approaches the jj limit. Additionally, we demonstrate that the stability of the low-symmetry high-pressure phases (Am-III and Am-IV) is governed by a Peierls-like distortion mechanism, which reduces the total energy through symmetry-lowering lattice distortions accompanied by electronic reconstruction. This study offers a new microscopic perspective on high-pressure phase transitions and emergent quantum phenomena in actinide materials.</p>

            <p>Layered magnetic transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are a focal point of research, revealing a variety of intriguing magnetic and topological ground states. Within this family of TMCs, chromium telluride has garnered significant attention because of its excellent tunability in magnetic response, owing to the presence of competing magnetic exchange interactions. We here demonstrate the manipulation of magnetic anisotropy in ultra-thin Cr$_2$Te$_3$ films through growth engineering leading to a controlled transition from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation with an intermediate non-coplanar magnetic ground phase characterized by a topological Hall effect. Moreover, interfacing these films with Vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) molecules prominently enhances the non-coplanar magnetic phase, attributing its presence to the competing interfacial magnetic exchange interactions over the spin-orbit-driven interfacial effects. These findings pave the way for the realization of novel topological spintronic devices through interface-modulated exchange coupling.</p>

The heavy tail persists across a range of system sizes, correlation lengths of the disorder potential and fillings.

            <p>Two-dimensional non-interacting fermions without any anti-unitary symmetries generically get Anderson localized in the presence of disorder. In contrast, topological superconductors with their inherent particle-hole symmetry can host a thermal metallic phase, which is non-universal and depends on the nature of microscopic disorder. In this work, we demonstrate that in the presence of geometric disorders, such as random bond dilution, a robust metal can emerge in a Chern insulator with particle-hole symmetry. The metallic phase is realized when the broken links are weakly stitched via concomitant insertion of $\pi$ fluxes in the plaquettes. These nucleate low-energy manifolds, which can provide percolating conduction pathways for fermions to elude localization. This diffusive metal, unlike those in superconductors, can carry charge current and even anomalous Hall current. We investigate the transport properties and show that while the topological insulator to Anderson insulator transition exhibits the expected Dirac universality, the metal insulator transition displays a different critical exponent $\nu \approx 2$ compared to a disordered topological superconductor, where $\nu \approx 1.4$. Our work emphasizes the unique role of geometric disorder in engineering novel phases and their transitions in topological quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Topological spin textures in frustrated intermetallics hold great promise for spintronics applications. However, understanding their origin and properties remains a significant challenge due to competing and often long-range interactions mediated by conduction electrons. Here, by combining neutron scattering experiments with theoretical modeling via unprecedented multi-target fits that further incorporate the ferromagnentic resonance data and magnetization curve, we construct a realistic microscopic model for the prototypical intermetallic skyrmion host \text{Gd}$_3$\text{Ru}$_4$\text{Al}$_{12}$. Beyond magnetic frustration, we identify the competition between dipolar interactions and easy-plane single-ion anisotropy as a key ingredient for stabilizing the rich chiral magnetic phases observed in this compound -- including a hexagonal skyrmion crystal and two distinct meron crystals. Remarkably, the meron crystal in lower field is revealed to be commensurate with the underlying lattice, and its unique three-meron-one-antimeron spin texture is verified by the polarized x-ray diffraction data. At elevated temperatures, the short-range spin correlations in \text{Gd}$_3$\text{Ru}$_4$\text{Al}$_{12}$ are well described by a codimension-two spiral spin-liquid. Perturbations from staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions give rise to chiral fluctuations that account for the temperature and field dependence of the anomalous Hall response. Our results highlight the unique power of neutron scattering, especially when combined with complementary experimental techniques, to unravel complex magnetic phase transitions and provide new insights into the rich variety of topological spin textures in frustrated systems.</p>

They give rise to spin-liquid phases with full spin-rotation and lattice-translational symmetries but broken time-reversal symmetry.

In contrast, the spin-7/2 model exhibits a significantly richer phase diagram, involving different types of chiral spin liquids competing with a $d$-wave altermagnetic spin liquid. Finally, we identify and characterize the topological and non-topological excitations, illustrating the rich physics of altermagnetic spin liquids resulting from the interplay of non-trivial topological and symmetry aspects of this novel phase of matter.</p>

            <p>Synthetic ferrimagnetic (SFiM) multilayers offer a versatile platform for hosting skyrmions with tunable magnetic properties, combining the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Unlike synthetic antiferromagnets, SFiMs retain a finite magnetization that allows direct observation of magnetic textures while still benefiting from reduced dipolar fields and a suppressed skyrmion Hall effect. However, a systematic investigation of their temperature and field dependent magnetization evolution, including the labyrinthine-to-skyrmion transition in Co/Gd-based SFiMs, remains less explored. Here, we demonstrate the stabilization of 70 nm-radius skyrmions at room temperature and reveal how the Co and Gd sublattices influence the temperature-dependent net magnetization. Further, we develop a microscopic spin model for SFiM incorporating the relevant magnetic interactions, which reproduces the experimental observations and captures the temperature-dependent magnetic phase evolution. This framework highlights the interplay of fundamental interactions controlling skyrmion stability in SFiM and provides a pathway for engineering heterostructures for topological spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Theoretically predicted antiperovskite carbides M$_6$CSe$_4$ (M = Ca, Sr) represent an emerging class of optoelectronic materials with potential relevance for photovoltaic applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of their electronic, optical, and excitonic properties, together with non-radiative recombination dynamics. Density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (GW) reveal that both compounds are direct band gap semiconductors with gaps spanning the infrared-visible region. Incorporating electron-hole interactions via the Bethe-Salpeter equation leads to pronounced red-shifts in the first peak of optical spectra, indicative of bound excitons with binding energies of 0.12 eV (Ca$_6$CSe$_4$) and 0.20 eV (Sr$_6$CSe$_4$), extending over nearly three unit cells in all directions. Time-dependent DFT combined with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K reveals pronounced lattice fluctuations in Ca$_6$CSe$_4$, resulting in 38% larger band gap variations and 28% faster electronic decoherence. Together with 53% weaker nonadiabatic couplings, these effects yield non-radiative recombination lifetimes approximately eleven times longer than in Sr$_6$CSe$_4$. Overall, our results identify M$_6$CSe$_4$ carbides as promising lead-free photovoltaic materials, with Ca$_6$CSe$_4$ exhibiting superior optoelectronic properties and carrier dynamics that motivate further experimental investigation.</p>

            <p>Conventional spintronic mechanisms, such as spin-transfer and spin-orbit torques based on the spin current, rely on breaking time-reversal symmetry to manipulate magnetic moments. In contrast, for spatially separated dual spin currents, the time-reversal-invariant vector chirality emerges as a critical factor governing magnetization dynamics. Here, we investigate field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in an altermagnet RuO2/ferromagnet/heavy metal Pt trilayer, driven by chiral dual spin currents (CDSC). We demonstrate that the chirality of these dual spin currents acts as the deterministic role in breaking out-of-plane symmetry. Leveraging the intrinsic spin-splitting effect of the d-wave altermagnet to generate an x-polarized spin component, the interplay of non-collinear spin currents from two adjacent layers induces a helical magnetic texture within the intermediate layer. The resulting intralayer exchange coupling manifests as an effective in-plane magnetic field, facilitating deterministic switching. This distinct physical picture, validated by switching measurements and micromagnetic simulations, reveals that the switching polarity is dictated by chirality rather than charge current polarity. Characterized by the novel symmetry and low power consumption, CDSC offers a promising paradigm for next-generation high-performance spintronic architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumyadeep Halder, Hari Sadhan Ghosh, Axel Pelster, B. Prasanna Venkatesh</p>
            <p>We show that a sudden change in the polarization direction of the magnetic dipole moments of the atoms in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can serve as a useful probe to sense its superfluid and solid-like properties. We find that for small angular deviation of the polarization direction, actuated for instance by modifying an external magnetic field, the superfluid state undergoes an undamped scissors mode oscillation, a characteristic signature of superfluidity. In contrast, both the droplet and supersolid states exhibit a scissors-mode oscillation, which is effectively damped due to multiple closely spaced frequency components. Notably, we find that this damping rate provides a direct quantitative measure for the rigidity of different phases of a dipolar BEC. Furthermore, there exists a maximum angular deviation of the polarization direction, beyond which the droplet and the supersolid states undergo a permanent deformation i.e., we find an analog of the usual elastic to plastic phase transition of solids. We characterize this transition numerically using the fidelity of the condensate wavefunction with the ground state as well as the droplet width and periodicity of the supersolid density of the condensate which are experimentally accessible. Thus, the technique introduced here can be an important experimental benchmark to identify and characterize the superfluid and solid properties of different phases of dipolar BECs.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism is a newly discovered fundamental form of magnetic order, distinct from conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. It uniquely exhibits no net magnetization while simultaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry, a combination previously thought to be mutually exclusive. Although its existence and signatures in momentum space have been established, the direct real-space visualization of its defining rotational symmetry breaking has remained a missing cornerstone. Here, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we present atomic-scale imaging of electronic states in the candidate material CsV2Se2O. We directly visualize the hallmark symmetry breaking in the form of unidirectional electronic patterns tied to magnetic domain walls and spin defects, as well as elliptical charging rings surrounding those defects. These observed electronic states are all linked to the underlying alternating spin texture. Our work provides the foundational real-space evidence for altermagnetism, moving the field from theoretical and momentum-space probes to direct visual confirmation; thereby opening a path to explore how this unconventional magnetic order couples to and controls other quantum electronic states.</p>

            <p>This paper focuses on the study of linear exciton Hall and Nernst effects in monolayer two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, employing the semi-classical transport theory. By deriving the exciton Berry curvature in momentum space for a general inhomogeneous 2D system, we establish its dependence on the Berry curvature and the effective mass of electron and hole. As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material. This observation holds promise for future optoelectronic applications and offers exciting possibilities for experimental exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir A. Vdovin, Ivan I. Pyataikin</p>
            <p>To examine the process of native corrosion of ultrathin (about 10 nm) copper films deposited on quartz glass substrates $(SiO_2)$ with and without a germanium sublayer, the time dependences of the microwave reflection coefficient $R$ and direct current electrical resistivity $\rho$ of such samples exposed to air at room temperature have been studied. Under these conditions, the thickness of the oxide layer $d$ on $Cu/SiO_2$ films was found to increase over time $t$ according to a parabolic law, which is in contradiction with the predictions of existing theories of copper oxidation. A model is proposed that explains this behavior of $d(t)$ by the diffusion of atomic oxygen along the boundaries of oxide grains towards the copper film with its subsequent oxidation. The $R$ and $\rho$ of $Cu/Ge/SiO_2$ films were found to degrade much more slowly than similar characteristics of $Cu/SiO_2$ films of the same thickness. The high corrosion resistance of $Cu/Ge/SiO_2$ films is explained by the peculiarities of $Ge$ redistribution during the growth of the copper film on a germanium sublayer. The long-term retention by $Cu/Ge/SiO_2$ films of their characteristics allows them to be recommended as a cheap replacement for gold coating in electromagnetic interference protection devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Tao Huang, X.S Wang</p>
            <p>Magnons are bosonic quasiparticles in magnetically ordered systems. Bosonic Bott index has been affirmed as a real-space topological invariant for a two-band ferromagnetic model. In this work,we theoretically investigate the topology and transport of magnons in a multi-band bosonic Kagome ferromagnetic model. We demonstrate the validity of the bosonic Bott indices of values larger than 1 in multi-band magnonic systems by showing the agreement with Chern numbers in the clean limit and the bulk-boundary correspondence during the topological phase transition. For the high Bott index phase, the disorder-induced topological phase transition occurs in a multi-step manner. Using a generalized Landauer-Buttiker formalism, we reveal how the magnon transport depends on Gilbert damping and disorder under coherent excitation or temperature difference. The results further justify the bosonic Bott index as a robust real-space topological invariant for multi-band magnonic systems and provide insights into the transport of topological magnons.</p>

            <h2>Topological spin textures in an antiferromagnetic monolayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Zahner, Tim Drevelow, Roberto Lo Conte, Roland Wiesendanger, Stefan Heinze, Kirsten von Bergmann</p>
            <p>Topological spin structures such as magnetic skyrmions are of fundamental interest and promising for various types of applications in spintronics. Skyrmions have been predicted to emerge also in antiferromagnetic materials where they exhibit superior transport properties. They were experimentally revealed in synthetic antiferromagnets, however, still remain elusive in intrinsic antiferromagnets. Here, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological spin structures in an antiferromagnetic monolayer. Using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, we observe an antiferromagnetic spin spiral in the Mn monolayer and a collinear antiferromagnetic state in the Mn double-layer on Ta(110). Near the boundary to the double-layer half-skyrmions form in the monolayer as revealed in combination with first-principles calculations and micromagnetic simulations. Our work shows how the topological state in antiferromagnetic material systems can be controlled by the configuration within a lateral heterostructure, resulting in trivial non-coplanar states or antiferromagnetic skyrmions.</p>

            <p>The paper presents a comprehensive description of a new setup implemented and commissioned at the SEXTANTS beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron for absorption and scattering experiments with x-ray beams carrying an orbital angular momentum, also known as twisted x-ray beams. Two alternative methods have been implemented, based on the use of either spiral zone plates or fork gratings devices, and we show how they can be used for both defining and assessing the orbital angular momentum of an x-ray beam. We show also how multiple devices can be used in sequence to define an integer arithmetic of the orbital angular momentum of the final x-ray beam. Finally, we report the results of the first resonant scattering pilot experiments in transmission and reflection mode, intended to assess the feasibility of future users measurements. The availability of twisted soft x-rays complements the range of experimental techniques in elastic, resonant and coherent scattering available at the SEXTANTS beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron.</p>

            <h2>Extending the Growth Temperature-N Concentration Regime Through Pd Doping in Fe4N Thin Films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Kumar Meena, Akhil Tayal, Andrei Gloskovskii, Mukul Gupta</p>
            <p>Fe4N is a well-known anti-perovskite compound exhibiting high magnetization, high chemical stability, low coercivity, high Curie temperature, and high spin-polarization ratio. Therefore, it is a viable candidate for applications in spintronic and magnetic storage devices. However, the Fe4N phase is formed in a narrow substrate temperature (Ts)-N concentration (Nc) regime in the phase diagram of Fe-N. It has been observed that a slight N deficiency will lead to impurity of alpha-Fe, and some N efficiency would result in epsilon-Fe3N phase. Through this work, it has been demonstrated that the doping of Pd can be suitably utilized to extend the Ts-Nc regime for the growth of Fe4N thin films. EXAFS analysis indicate that Pd atoms are substituting corner Fe atoms. Magnetization measurements reveal that the saturation magnetization reduces nominally with Pd doping up to 13 at.%. Therefore, it is foreseen that Pd doping is effective in extending the Fe4N phase formation regime without a significant impact on its structural, electronic, and magnetic properties.</p>

            <h2>Increased Covalence and V-center mediated Dark Fenton-Like Reactions in V-doped TiO2: Mechanisms of Enhanced Charge-Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manju Kumari, Dilip Sasmal, Suresh Chandra Baral, Maneesha P, Poonam Singh, Abdelkrim Mekki, Khalil Harrabi, Somaditya Sen</p>
            <p>Tuning the valence state and electronic structure of catalytically active sites is crucial for improving Fenton and Fenton-like reactions, which rely on the efficient activation of the H2O2 molecule. Pure TiO2, however, has inadequate activity towards the H2O2 activation and is often constrained by the intrinsic electronic limitations of pristine TiO2. Herein, a rational approach has been demonstrated to improve the Fenton-like catalytic performance of TiO2 through multivalent vanadium (V) doping. A comprehensive characterization using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that V incorporation substantially alters the electronic structure of TiO2. The DFT results, supported by experimental data, indicate that V doping enhances Ti-O covalence and introduces mid-gap states, resulting in a reduced band gap and improved charge transfer. XPS confirms the coexistence of multiple oxidation states of V, which serve as active centres for activating H2O2 and generating OH radicals. As a result, V-doped TiO2 exhibits significantly enhanced dark-catalytic activity in degrading the organic dye Rhodamine B (RhB). Overall, this study provides fundamental insights into multivalent-cation-induced valence state and electronic structure modulation in TiO2, offering a promising strategy for designing high-performance catalysts via defect engineering for sustainable environmental remediation.</p>

            <p>Interfacial reconstruction between two-dimensional (2D) materials and metal substrates fundamentally governs heterostructure properties, yet conventional flat substrates fail to capture the continuous crystallographic landscape. Here, we overcome this topological limitation using non-Euclidean interfaces-curved 2D graphene-copper surfaces as a model system-to traverse the infinite spectrum of lattice orientations. By integrating multimodal microscopy with a deep-learning-enhanced dimensional upscaling framework, we translate 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) contrast into quantitative three-dimensional (3D) morphologies with accurate facet identification. Coupling these observations with machine-learning-assisted density functional theory, we demonstrate that reconstruction is governed by a unified thermodynamic mechanism where high-index facets correspond to specific local minima in the surface energy landscape. This work resolves the long-standing complexity of graphene-copper faceting and establishes non-Euclidean surface topologies as a generalizable paradigm for decoding and controlling interfacial reconstruction in diverse metal-2D material systems.</p>

            <p>Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, yet their potential for optoelectronic applications remains largely unexplored. Here, we report high-performance photodetectors based on van der Waals KV$_3$Sb$_5$/WSe$_2$ heterojunctions. A high-quality Schottky interface readily forms between KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and WSe$_2$, enabling efficient separation and transport of photoinduced carriers. Under 520 nm illumination, the device achieves an open-circuit voltage up to 0.6 V, a responsivity of 809 mA/W, and a fast response time of 18.3 us. This work demonstrates the promising optoelectronic applications of Kagome metals and highlights the potential of KV$_3$Sb$_5$-based van der Waals heterostructures for high-performance photodetection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang-Shin Baak</p>
            <p>It is shown that the sound wave in the backreaction affected dynamical spacetime follows the equations for a massive scalar field in a analogue spacetime using number-conserving approach. Even with backreaction, the analogue metric is in the same form to the case without backreaction. The sound velocity, fluid density, and fluid velocity are defined with small correction to include the backreaction effect. Moreover, the modification of classical fluid dynamical equations by the backreaction introduces spacetime dependent mass. For a finite-size homogeneous quasi-one dimensional Bose gas, we find that the backreaction increase the UV divergence of the equal position correlation function. Moreover, in this model, we see that the backreaction increase the correlation in a finite region and decrease the correlation in far region.</p>

            <p>Tritium adsorption on surfaces creates a variety of issues, ranging from the fields of fusion applications to small and large-scale laboratory experiments using tritium. The extent to which tritium accumulates on surfaces is generally material-dependent and must be determined through experiments. Additionally, this surface contamination necessitates the implementation of appropriate decontamination procedures, preferably in-situ. A suitable method could be exposure to ozone during UV irradiation. However, it is currently not known if both components are necessary for the decontamination. At Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe, both questions on contamination and decontamination can be addressed using a single experimental setup. With this, it is possible to expose solid samples to gaseous tritium to measure the temporal activity evolution. Furthermore, the system can be filled with dry air, and dry air containing ozone to explore their decontamination effect. Both measurement modes were applied to beryllium and tungsten samples, which were chosen for their relevance in fusion. The beryllium surface was observed to accumulate tritium more than four times faster than tungsten when exposed to gaseous tritium. Concerning the decontamination, without simultaneous UV irradiation, exposure to ozone did not have any distinct effect on the surface activity compared to simply using dry air. This leads to the conclusion that UV illumination of the surfaces is required to achieve a significant decontamination factor.</p>

            <p>Magnetic multipole moments beyond dipoles have emerged as key descriptors of unconventional electromagnetic responses in crystalline solids. However, a gauge-invariant bulk expression for orbital magnetic multipole moments has remained elusive, hindering a unified understanding of their physical consequences. Here we formulate a gauge-invariant expression for the orbital magnetic octupole moment in periodic crystals and investigate its behavior in a minimal model of $d$-wave altermagnets. We show that the orbital magnetic octupole is naturally linked to a higher-rank Hall response induced by spatially nonuniform electric fields, leading to a generalized Středa-type relation. Finally, we demonstrate that such a Hall response can arise even when symmetry forbids the conventional anomalous Hall effect against uniform electric fields, thereby providing an illustrative response characteristic to altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>Geometry induced net spin polarization of $d$-wave altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhiram Soori</p>
            <p>Altermagnets exhibit spin-split electronic band structures despite having zero net magnetization, making them attractive for field-free spintronic applications. In this work, we show that a finite rectangular altermagnetic sample can acquire a net spin polarization purely due to its geometry. This effect arises from the interplay between the anisotropic, spin-resolved Fermi contours of an altermagnet and the discrete sampling of momentum space imposed by unequal sample dimensions. By explicitly counting occupied states, we demonstrate that rectangular samples with $L_x \neq L_y$ host a finite spin polarization, which vanishes in the symmetric limit $L_x=L_y$ and in the thermodynamic limit. We further show that this geometry-induced spin polarization can be directly probed in transport measurements. In the tunneling regime, the ratio of spin to charge conductance exhibits characteristic square-like patterns as a function of sample dimensions, faithfully reflecting the underlying spin polarization. In addition, transport across ferromagnet--altermagnet--ferromagnet junctions reveals an asymmetric magnetoresistance with respect to reversal of the Zeeman field, providing an independent transport signature of the finite spin polarization. Our results establish geometry as an effective control parameter for spin polarization in altermagnets and suggest a viable route for exploiting finite-size effects in mesoscopic altermagnetic spintronic devices.</p>

Using Monte Carlo simulations and combinatorial arguments on a corresponding lattice model, we determine three equilibrium phases, two in which the rings segregate in space and are either extended (the segregated-expanded phase) or compact (the segregated-collapsed phase). The third is a mixed phase where the rings interpenetrate. The corresponding phase boundaries are located numerically and their critical nature is discussed. Finally, by looking at the topological properties of the three phases, we show that the two rings are likely to be linked in the mixed phase and knotted in the segregated-collapsed phase.</p>

Here we report an insulator-superconductor transition driven by in-plane magnetic fields B|| in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. The upper critical in-plane field of 2T violates the Pauli limit, and an analysis based on isospin symmetry breaking supports a spin-polarized superconductor. At in-plane B = 0, such spin-polarized superconductor transitions into an insulator, exhibiting a thermally activated gap of 0.1 meV. In addition, we observe four superconducting states in the hole-doped regime, as well as phases with orbital multiferroicity near charge neutrality point. These findings substantially enrich the phase diagram of rhombohedral graphene and provide new insight into the microscopic mechanisms of superconductivity</p>

            <h2>Tethering effects on first-passage variables of lattice random walks in linear and quadratic focal point potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debraj Das, Luca Giuggioli</p>
            <p>Diffusion in a confining potential offers a minimal setting to understand the interplay between random motion and deterministic forces driving a particle towards a focal point or potential minimum. In continuous space and time, two extensively studied examples are Brownian motion in a linear (V-shaped) or a quadratic (U-shaped) potential. The deterministic bias towards the minimum is represented, respectively, by a constant force for the former and by an elastic restoring force that increases proportionally with distance for the latter. Surprisingly, unlike Brownian walks, random walks under focal point potentials in discrete space and time have received little attention. Here, we bridge this gap by analysing the dynamics of lattice random walkers in the presence of a V-shaped potential, both in a finite and an infinite spatial domain, and a finite U-shaped potential. For the V-potential in unbounded space, we find the generating function of the occupation probability and analyse the time dependence of the mean number of distinct sites visited, demonstrating that its long-time growth is logarithmic. We also study the first-passage probability and show that its mean may display a minimum as a function of bias strength, depending on the location of the initial and target sites relative to the focal point. Qualitatively similar dependencies in the first-passage probability and its mean appear for the finite U-potential. As a comparative analysis to the U-potential, we construct the bounded V-potential and superimpose in both cases a resetting process, in which the walker returns at random times to a site distinct from the focal point with some probability. We quantify the different effects of resetting on the steady-state probability and the first-passage dynamics in the two cases, and show a motion-limited regime emerges even for relatively moderate resetting probabilities.</p>

            <p>Electrochemical systems are important for a sustainable and defossilized energy system of the future. While accurate and precise, the corresponding electrochemical measurements, in which many reactions may occur simultaneously, often do not contain enough information to understand the underlying mechanism and processes. This information, however, is crucial towards rational materials and devices as well as process development and for inventing new concepts. We introduce explicitly the concept of "X-ray Coulomb Counting" in which X-ray methods are used to quantify on an absolute scale how much charge is transferred into which reactions during the electrochemical measurements. This allows to interpret the electrochemical measurements in detail and obtain the desired phenomenological and mechanistic understanding. We show a few recent examples from the Li-ion battery literature in which the concept of X-ray Coulomb Counting was employed to obtain foundational understanding.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation relies on the preparation and control of low-entropy many-body systems to reveal the behavior of classically intractable models. The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</p>

            <p>Valleytronics is a rapidly advancing field that explores the use of the valley degree of freedom in electronic systems to encode and process information. It relies on electronic states with spin valley locking, first predicted and observed in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2. However, very few bulk materials have been reported to host spin valley locked electronic states. In this work, we present experimental evidence for a predicted, unique spin valley locked electronic state generated by Bi zigzag chains in the layered compound BaMnBi2. We observe remarkable quantum transport properties in this material, including a stacked quantum Hall effect (QHE) and a nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). From the analysis of the QHE, we identify a spin valley degeneracy of four, while the NLHE provides supporting evidence for the anticipated valley contrasted Berry curvature, a typical signature of a spin valley locked state. This spin valley locked state contrasts with that observed in the sister compound BaMnSb2, where the degeneracy is two. This difference arises from significant variations in their orthorhombic crystal structures and spin orbit coupling. These findings establish a new platform for exploring coupled spin valley physics in bulk materials and highlight its potential for valleytronic device applications.</p>

            <p>Spherical particles confined to a sphere surface cannot pack densely into a hexagonal lattice without defects. In this study, we use hard particle Monte Carlo simulations to determine the effects of continuously deformable shape anisotropy and underlying crystal lattice preference on inevitable defect structures and their distribution within colloidal assemblies of hard rounded polyhedra confined to a closed sphere surface. We demonstrate that cube particles form a simple square assembly, overcoming lattice/topology incompatibility, and maximize entropy by distributing eight three-fold defects evenly on the sphere. By varying particle shape smoothly from cubes to spheres we reveal how the distribution of defects changes from square antiprismatic to icosahedral symmetry. Congruent studies of rounded tetrahedra reveal additional varieties of characteristic defect patterns within three, four, and six-fold symmetric lattices. This work has promising implications for programmable defect generation to facilitate different vesicle buckling modes using colloidal particle emulsions.</p>

            <p>Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</p>

            <p>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) enables fabrication of atomically precise structures with unique properties and growing technological potential. However, reproducible manipulation of covalently bonded atoms requires control over the atomic configuration of both sample and probe - a longstanding challenge in STM. Here, we introduce inverted-mode STM, an approach that enables mechanically controlled chemical reactions for atomically precise fabrication. Tailored molecules on a Si(100) surface image the probe apex, and the usual challenge of understanding the probe structure is effectively solved. The molecules can also react with the probe, with the two sides of the tunnel junction acting as reagents positioned with sub-angstrom precision. This allows abstraction or donation of atoms from or to the probe apex. We demonstrate this by using a novel alkynyl-terminated molecule to reproducibly abstract hydrogen atoms from the probe. The approach is expected to extend to other elements and moieties, opening a new avenue for scalable atomically precise fabrication.</p>

            <p>Large-area deposition of Aluminium-Scandium-Nitride (Al1-xScxN) thin films with higher Sc content (x) remains challenging due to issues such as abnormal orientation growth, stress control, and the undesired crystal phase. These anomalies across the wafer hinder the development of high scandium-content AlScN films, which are critical for microelectromechanical systems applications. In this study, we report the sputter deposition of Al0.64Sc0.36N thin films from a 300 mm Al0.64Sc0.36 alloy target on 200 mm Si(100) wafers, achieving an exceptionally high deposition rate of 8.7 {\mu}m/h with less than 1% AOGs and controllable stress tuning. Comprehensive microstructural and electrical characterizations confirm the superior growth of high-quality Al0.64Sc0.36N films with exceptional wafer-average piezoelectric coefficients (d33,f =15.62 pm/V and e31,f = -2.9 C/m2) owing to low point defects density and grain mosaicity. This was accomplished through the implementation of an optimized seed layer and a refined electrode integration strategy, along with optimal process conditions. The wafer yield and device failure rates are analysed and correlated with the average stress of the films and their stress profiles along the diameter. The resulting films show excellent uniformity in structural, compositional, and piezoelectric properties across the entire 200 mm wafer, underscoring their strong potential for next-generation MEMS applications.</p>

            <h2>Connecting strain rate dependence of fcc metals to dislocation avalanche signatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Aissaoui, C. Kahloun, O.U. Salman, S. Queyreau</p>
            <p>Strain rate sensitivity is a key feature of material deformation, whose importance is growing both because miniaturized components experience higher effective rates and because small scale simulations increasingly probe such conditions. As a dynamical characteristic, strain rate dependence is shown to be intimately connected to dislocation avalanches, which are a fundamental mechanism of dislocation dynamics. Using carefully designed, state of the art dislocation dynamics simulations in the intermediate range strain rate from 5 to 1000, we show that increasing strain rate promotes the activation of a growing number of stronger sites. The dislocation microstructure progressively rearranges into configurations with shorter segments. Dislocation avalanches become larger through the superposition of simultaneous events and because stronger obstacles are required to arrest them. As a result, the avalanche statistics are strongly affected by strain rate, with a reduced power law regime and an increasing power law exponent. Larger avalanches, in turn, lead to an enhanced dislocation storage rate. Contribution from collinear systems to avalanches and cross slip activity decreases, altering the fraction of screw dislocations and the resulting microstructure. These results provide an original mesoscopic picture of rate sensitivity in this strain rate range and offer a mechanistic interpretation of existing observations and findings from experiments and simulations.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Finite Element and Molecular Dynamics for Non-Fourier Thermal Transport Near Nanoscale Hot Spot</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanvirul Abedien, Tianli Feng</p>
            <p>Nanoscale hot spots forming tens of nanometers beneath the gate in advanced FinFET and HEMT devices drive heat transport into a non-Fourier regime, challenging conventional (Fourier-based) finite-element (FEM) analyses and complicating future thermal-aware chip design. Molecular dynamics (MD) naturally captures ballistic transport and phonon nonequilibrium, but has not been applied to hot-spot problems due to computational cost. Here, we perform the first MD simulations of hot-spot heat transfer across ballistic-diffusive regimes and benchmark them against FEM. We find that FEM using bulk thermal conductivity $\kappa_0$ significantly underestimates hot-spot temperature, even when the channel thickness is ~10 times the phonon mean free path, indicating persistent non-Fourier effects. We introduce a size-dependent "best" conductivity, $\kappa_{\mathrm{best}}$, using which FEM can reproduce MD hot-spot temperatures with high fidelity. We further decompose the MD-extracted thermal resistance into: (i) diffusive spreading, (ii) cross-plane ballistic, (iii) heat-carrier selective heating, and (iv) residual 3D ballistic-spreading resistances, and quantify each contribution. The resulting framework offers a practical route to embed non-Fourier physics into FEM for hot-spot prediction, reliability assessment, and thermally aware design of next-generation transistors.</p>

            <p>A model of microscopic interaction between a superconductor and a one-dimensional topological insulator, an SSH chain, is considered. Using the functional integration method, the effective action of the interaction between a superconductor and a topological insulator is obtained. We obtain corrections to the quasiparticle excitation spectrum of the SSH chain due to tunneling in various limits and discuss the influence of phase fluctuations. We find that for bulk superconductors, the states of the chain are stable for energies lying inside the superconducting gap while in lower-dimensional superconductors phase fluctuations yield finite temperature-dependent lifetimes even inside the gap. We also discuss whether these results can be reproduced within a simple phenomenological approach.</p>

            <h2>Detection of a Rényi Index Dependent Transition in Entanglement Entropy Scaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hatem Barghathi, Adrian Del Maestro</p>
            <p>The scaling of entanglement with subsystem size encodes key information about phases and criticality, but the von Neumann entropy is costly to access in experiments and simulations, often requiring full state tomography. The second Rényi entropy is readily measured using two-copy protocols and is often used as a proxy for the von Neumann entanglement entropy, where it is assumed to track its asymptotic scaling. However, Sugino and Korepiny (Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 32, 1850306 (2018)) revealed that in the ground state of some spin models, the scaling of the von Neumann and second Rényi entropies varies from power law to logarithmic scaling as a function of the Rényi index. By constructing a number-conserving many-body state with only two local degrees of freedom, we obtain a Rényi-index-dependent change in the leading entanglement scaling: the second Rényi entropy remains logarithmic while the von Neumann entropy is parametrically larger. We then introduce a symmetry-aware lower bound on the von Neumann entropy built from charge-resolved second Rényi entropies and the subsystem charge distribution. Comparing this bound to the total second Rényi entropy provides a practical diagnostic for anomalous entanglement scaling from experimentally accessible data.</p>

            <p>Linear response theory has found many applications in statistical physics. One of these is to compute minimal-work protocols that drive nonequilibrium systems between different thermodynamic states, which are useful for designing engineered nanoscale systems and understanding biomolecular machines. We compare and explore the relationships between linear-response-based approximations used to study optimal protocols in different driving regimes by showing that they arise as controlled truncations of a general causal response (Volterra) expansion. We then construct higher-order response terms and discuss the drawbacks and utility of their inclusion. We illustrate our results for an overdamped particle in a harmonic trap, ultimately showing that the inclusion of higher-order response in calculating optimal protocols provides marginal improvement in effectiveness despite incurring a significant computational expense, while introducing the possibility of predicting arbitrarily low and unphysical negative excess work.</p>

            <h2>From Berry curvature to quantum metric: a new era of quantum geometry metrology for Bloch electrons in solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bohm-Jung Yang</p>
            <p>For decades, ``geometry" in band theory has largely meant Berry phase and Berry curvature-quantities that reshape semiclassical dynamics and underpin modern topological matter. Yet the full geometric content of a Bloch band is richer and encoded in the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose imaginary part is the Berry curvature and whose real part is the quantum metric. Here, we briefly review the recent progress in direct experimental access to the QGT in real crystalline solids using the polarization- and spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The extraction of the QGT in momentum space was successfully addressed by two different approaches: One is by introducing quasi-QGT that faithfully represents the QGT and is directly measurable by ARPES. The other is through pseudospin tomography in a material with simple low energy band structure, which successfully retrieved all matrix components of the quantum metric. We discuss the physical meaning of these two recent progresses, their implication/limitation, and open directions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daiki Kawasaki, Ippei Danshita</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the collective excitations in a spin-1 $XY$ model with a quadratic Zeeman term and a long-range interaction that decays algebraically with the distance. Using the quantum-field theory based on the finite-temperature Green's function formalism, we analyze properties of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) and Higgs modes in order to analytically evaluate the damping rate of the Higgs mode in the $XY$ ferromagnetic ordered phase near the quantum phase transition to the disordered phase. When the power of the algebraic decay is 3 as in the case of dipole-dipole interactions in Rydberg-atom systems, we show that at two dimensions the excitation energy of the Higgs mode exhibits a linear dispersion whereas the dispersion of the NG mode becomes proportional to the square root of the momentum. We find that the damping of the Higgs mode is significantly suppressed by the long-range interaction. We also propose how to excite and probe the Higgs mode in Rydberg-atom experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joonggwon Kim, Dogyun Byeon</p>
            <p>The release of hydrophilic solutes from micron scale particulate formulations can be understood as an interfacial transport problem in which diffusion across a heterogeneous amphiphilic coating competes with dissolution and convective removal in the surrounding medium. Here we reinterpret a glycerin fatty acid ester (GFAE) coated thiamine (vitamin B1) micro particle formulation as a condensed matter system: a soft matter core shell geometry whose effective permeability is set by the nanoscale organization of amphiphilic lipids at the interface. Using in vivo time course serum measurements in mice as a proxy for a stochastic sink, we compare the coated formulation (UTEV) with a composition matched uncoated comparator (UMFG). Early time systemic appearance is similar, whereas late time levels are enhanced for the coated particles, implying a reduced effective interfacial diffusivity and a broadened release-time distribution. We discuss the results in terms of diffusion barrier physics, heterogeneous interfacial energetics, and coarse grained transport models that map microstructural coating parameters to macroscopic persistence (AUC).</p>

            <p>Materials with interesting physical properties are often designed based on our understanding of the target physical effects. The physical properties can be either explicitly observed ("apparent") or concealed by the perceived symmetry ("hidden") but still exist. Both are enabled by specific symmetries and induced by certain physical interactions. Using the underlying approach of condensed matter theory of real materials (rather than schematic model Hamiltonians), we discuss apparent and hidden physics in real materials focusing on the properties of spin splitting and spin polarization. Depending on the enabling symmetries and underlying physical interactions, we classify spin effects into four categories with each having two subtypes; representative materials are pointed out. We then discuss the electric tunability and switch of apparent and hidden spin splitting and polarization in antiferromagnets. Finally, we extend "hidden effects" to views that are farsighted in the sense of resolving the correct atomistic and reciprocal symmetry and replaced by the incorrect higher symmetry. This framework could guide and enable systematic discovery of such intriguing effects.</p>

            <p>The nature of the broken time reversal symmetry (BTRS) state in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ remains elusive, and its relation to superconductivity remains controversial. There are various universal predictions for the BTRS state when it is associated with a multicomponent superconducting order parameter. In particular, in the BTRS superconducting state, spontaneous fields appear around crystalline defects, impurities, superconducting domain walls and sample surfaces. However, this phenomenon has not yet been experimentally demonstrated for any BTRS superconductor. Here, we aimed to verify these predictions for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ by performing muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements on Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$RuO$_4$ single crystals at ambient pressure and stoichiometric Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under hydrostatic pressure. The study allowed us to conclude that spontaneous fields in the BTRS superconducting state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ appear around non-magnetic inhomogeneities and, at the same time, decrease with the suppression of $T_{\rm c}$. The observed behaviour is consistent with the prediction for multicomponent BTRS superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. The results of the work are relevant to understanding BTRS superconductivity in general, as they demonstrate, for the first time, the relationship among the superconducting order parameter, the BTRS transition, and crystal-structure inhomogeneities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian-Peng Zhang, Xiangrong Wang, Yugui Yao</p>
            <p>Magnetoresistance (MR) in magnetic materials arises from spin-exchange coupling between local moments and itinerant electrons, representing a challenging many-body open-quantum problem. Here we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of MR within an open-quantum-system framework by solving the Liouville-von Neumann equation for a hybrid system of free electrons and local moments using the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Our approach reveals both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic MR as consequences of temperature- and field-dependent spin decoherence, encompassing spin relaxation and dephasing. In particular, the resistance associated with spin decoherence is governed by the order parameters of magnetic materials, such as the magnetization in ferromagnets and the Néel vector in antiferromagnets. This theory deepens the fundamental understanding of MR and offers guidance for interpreting and designing experiments on magnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Phase Transitions in Periodically Driving 1D Ising Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanyuan Cheng, Yuxia Zhang, Tianhui Qiu, Peipei Xin, Bao-Ming Xu</p>
            <p>This work investigates dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in a one-dimensional Ising model subjected to a periodically modulated transverse field. In contrast to sudden quenches, we demonstrate that DQPTs can be induced in two distinct ways. First, when the system remains within a given phase--ferromagnetic (FM) or paramagnetic (PM), a resonant periodic drive can trigger a DQPT when its frequency matches the energy-level transition of the system. The timescale for the transition is governed by the perturbation strength $\lambda'$, the critical mode $k_c$, and its energy gap $\Delta_{k_c}$, following the scaling relation $\tau \propto \sin^{-1}k_c \Delta_{k_c}\lambda'^{-1}$. Second, for drives across the critical point between the FM and PM phases, low frequencies can always induce DQPTs, regardless of resonance. This behavior stems from the degeneracy of the energy-level at the critical point, which ensures that any drive with a frequency lower than the system's intrinsic transition frequency will inevitably excite the system. However, in the high-frequency regime, such excitation will be strongly suppressed, thereby inhibiting the occurrence of DQPTs. This study provides deeper insight into the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum spin chains.</p>

            <h2>Vapor-solid-solid growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Hedman</p>
            <p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes are one-dimensional $sp^2$ carbon materials whose electronic and optical properties are governed by their chirality. Catalytic chemical vapor deposition often uses transition-metal nanoparticles that liquefy at elevated temperature, and vapor-liquid-solid growth is commonly associated with broad chirality distributions. Improved selectivity has been reported for high-melting-point catalysts that remain solid, suggesting vapor-solid-solid growth, but the underlying kinetics and interface structure remain poorly resolved. The mechanisms that control carbon delivery and determine edge structure on solid catalysts are therefore unclear. Here it is shown, using microsecond-scale molecular dynamics driven by a neuroevolution machine-learning interatomic potential, that rhenium nanoparticles remain solid above 1123.15 K and that surface carbon at 5.0 to 6.0 nm$^{-2}$ does not appreciably depress melting. Carbon transport is dominated by facet-dependent surface diffusion, bounding sustainable supply on a 2.0 nm particle to $\sim 44$ carbon atoms per $\mu$s on the slow $(10\bar{1}1)$ facet. Consistently, growth at 50 carbon atoms per $\mu$s occurs only within a narrow window: multiple nucleation or encapsulation is promoted at 1300 K, tubular elongation is obtained at 1400 K, and low-curvature graphitic structures dominate at 1500 K and above. Non-hexagonal rings persist over 12 $\mu$s, while zigzag-rich, strongly Klein-decorated edges are stabilized and deviate from configurational-entropy expectations for liquid catalysts. These results place catalyst reconstruction by surface carbon adsorption, facet-controlled diffusion, and crystalline interfacial thermodynamics at the center of vapor-solid-solid growth control, motivating experimental tuning of temperature and feedstock partial pressure to balance diffusion-limited supply against encapsulation pathways.</p>

            <p>We investigate the application of quantum computing algorithms to enhance the efficiency of enumerating self-avoiding walks (SAWs), utilizing quantum properties such as superposition and interference. A Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE)-based algorithm is developed to enumerate SAWs on both 2D and 3D lattices. In case of 2D square lattice, SAWs up to N=71 steps are successfully enumerated within 26.9 minutes - significantly improving upon the classical algorithm, which required approximately 231 hours(Jensen et al., 2012, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 45, 115202). The algorithm is further extended to 3D cubic lattices, where SAWs up to N=40 steps are enumerated in 13.06 minutes, compared to the classical result of N=36 in 250 hours (Schram et al., 2011, J.

            <p>Magnetic impurities in strongly correlated electronic systems serve as sensitive probes to a wide range of many-body quantum phenomena. Broken symmetries in such a system can lead to inequivalent lattice sites, and magnetic impurities may interact selectively with particular orbitals or sublattices. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind such site-specific interactions have been poorly understood. Here, we explore the behavior of individual Fe adatoms on a cluster-Mott charge-density-wave (CDW) system of 1T-TaS2 utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT). Our measurements uncover pronounced site-dependent electronic states of CDW clusters with Fe adatoms, indicating distinct local coupling to cluster-Mott states. DFT calculations identify three distinct types of interactions; hybridization with localized correlated electrons, distorting the CDW cluster, and charge transfer. In particular, the hybridization of Fe 3d and half-filled Ta 5dz2 orbitals suppresses the Mott insulating state for an adatom at the center of a CDW cluster. While the results underscore a crucial role of the direct orbital hybridization and the limitation of the prevailing single-site Kondo impurity model, they suggest the possibility of controlling entangled interactions separately in a cluster Mott insulator.</p>

            <p>Identifying the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors plays an essential role in the ongoing quest to understand correlated electronic matter. A long-standing approach is to study the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth $\lambda$ for evidence of nodal points where the superconducting gap vanishes. However, experimental reports can be ambiguous due to the requisite low-temperature resolution, and the similarity in signatures of nodal quasiparticles and impurity states. Here we study the pairing symmetry of Weyl semimetal $T_d$-MoTe$_2$, where previous measurements of $\lambda$ have yielded conflicting results. We utilize a novel technique based on a microwave resontor to measure the kinetic inductance of MoTe$_2$, which is directly related to $\lambda$. The high precision of this technique allows us to observe power-law temperature dependence of $\lambda$, and to measure the anomalous nonlinear Meissner effect -- the current dependence of $\lambda$ arising from nodal quasiparticles. Together, these measurements provide smoking gun signatures of nodal superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional materials are a fertile ground for exploring quantum geometric phenomena, with Berry curvature and its first moment, the Berry curvature dipole, playing a central role in their electronic response. These geometric properties influence electronic transport and result in the anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects, and are typically controlled using static electric fields or strain. However, the possibility of modulating quantum geometric quantities in real-time remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic modulation of Berry curvature and its moments, as well as the generation of a pseudo-electric field using time-dependent strain. By placing heterostructures on a membrane, we introduce oscillatory strain together with an in-plane AC electric field and measure Hall signals that are modulated at linear combinations of the frequencies of strain and electric field. Our measurements reveal modulation of Berry curvature and its first moment. Notably, we provide direct experimental evidence of pseudo-electric field that results in an unusual dynamic strain-induced Hall response. This approach opens up a new pathway for controlling quantum geometry on demand, moving beyond conventional static perturbations. The pseudo-electric field provides a framework for external electric field-free anomalous Hall response and opens new avenues for probing the topological properties.</p>

We highlight that the phases are given by the equivariant 2-Cohomotopy of the Brillouin torus of crystal momenta (with respect to wallpaper point group actions) -- which, despite the attention devoted to crystalline Chern insulators, seems not to have been considered before. Arguing then that any topological order must be reflected in the adiabatic monodromy of gapped quantum ground states over the covariantized space of these band topologies, we compute the latter in examples where this group is non-abelian, showing that any potential FQAH anyons must be localized in momentum space. We close with an outlook on the relevance for the search for topological quantum computing hardware. Mathematical details are spelled out in a supplement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kota Okajima, Koji Hukushima</p>
            <p>Brownian circuits implement computation through stochastic transitions driven by thermal fluctuations. While the energetic costs of such fluctuation-driven computation have been extensively studied within stochastic thermodynamics, much less is known about its computational complexity, in particular how computation time scales with circuit size. Here, the computation time of explicitly designed Brownian circuits is investigated numerically via the first-passage time to a completed state. For arithmetic circuits such as adders, varying the forward transition rate induces a sharp change in the scaling behavior of the mean computation time, from linear to exponential in circuit size. This change can be interpreted as an easy-hard transition in computational time complexity. The transition suggests that, for meaningful computational tasks, achieving efficient polynomial-time computation generically requires a finite forward bias, corresponding to a nonzero energy input. As a counterexample, it is shown that arbitrary logical operations can be reduced to an effectively one-dimensional stochastic process, for which the zero-bias limit lines within the computationally efficient (easy) regime. However, realizing such a one-dimensional normal form unavoidably leads to an exponential increase in circuit size. These results reveal a fundamental trade-off between computation time, circuit size, and energy input in Brownian circuits, and demonstrate that phase transitions in time complexity provide a natural framework for characterizing the cost of fluctuation-driven computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Hilke</p>
            <p>Quantum topology categorizes physical systems in integer invariants, which are robust to some deformations and certain types of disorder. A prime example is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which has two distinct topological phases, the trivial phase with no edge states and the non-trivial phase with zero-energy edge states. The energy dispersion of the SSH model is dominated by a gap around zero energy, which suppresses the transmission. This exponential suppression of the transmission with system length is determined by the Lyapounov exponent. Here we find an analytical expression of the Lyapounov as a function of energy in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder. We obtain this result by finding a recurrence relation for the local density, which can be averaged over different disorder configurations. There is excellent agreement between our analytical expression and the numerical results over a wide range of disorder strengths and disorder types. The real space winding number is evaluated as a function of off-diagonal and on-site disorder for possible applications of quantum topology.</p>

            <p>We investigate the electronic transport properties of a superconductor-quantum dot-superconductor Josephson junction coupled to a ferromagnetic metal reservoir in the presence of an external magnetic field. The device is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, whose complex eigenvalues encode the energy (real part) and the broadening (imaginary part) of the Andreev quasi-bound states. When extending the Andreev current formula to the non-Hermitian case, a novel contribution arises that is proportional to the phase derivative of the levels broadening. This term becomes particularly relevant in the presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectrum, but its experimental detection is not straightforward. We identify optimal Andreev spectrum configurations where this novel current contribution can be clearly highlighted, and we outline an experimental protocol for its detection. We point out that the phase dependence in the levels imaginary part originates from the breaking of a time-reversal-like symmetry. In particular, spectral configurations in the broken phase of the symmetry and without EPs can be obtained, where this novel contribution can be easily resolved. The proposed protocol would allow to probe for the first time a fingerprint of non-Hermiticity in open junctions that is not strictly related to the presence of EPs.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum Framework for Negative Magnetoresistance in Multi-Weyl Semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arka Ghosh, Sushmita Saha, Alestin Mawrie</p>
            <p>We develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory of negative magnetoresistance in multi-Weyl semimetals in the ${\bf E}\parallel{\bf B}$ configuration, where the chiral anomaly is activated. The magnetotransport response is governed by Landau quantization and the emergence of multiple chiral Landau levels associated with higher-order Weyl nodes. These anomaly-active modes have unidirectional dispersion fixed by the node's monopole charge and dominate charge transport. As the magnetic field increases, individual chiral branches successively cross the Fermi energy, producing discrete slope changes in the longitudinal conductivity and a step-like negative magnetoresistance. This quantized evolution provides a direct experimental signature of multi-Weyl topology. Bulk Landau levels contribute only at very low fields due to strong disorder scattering and do not affect the anomaly-driven regime. Our results establish a unified, fully quantum-mechanical framework in which negative magnetoresistance arises from the discrete Landau-quantized spectrum and microscopic impurity scattering, beyond semiclassical anomaly descriptions.</p>

            <h2>Essential Principles and Practices in X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Čechal</p>
            <p>X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is a widely utilized technique for chemical analysis of solid surfaces, sensitive to the chemical environment of atoms via core-level binding energy shifts. While modern instruments allow obtaining the experimental data with ease, their evaluation and interpretation is challenging to newcomers to the field as a profound knowledge of the method is required for a correct analysis. Here we present a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles and methodologies of XPS, covering photoemission processes, chemical shifts, charge referencing, peak fitting, and quantification strategies. This overview aims to bridge the gap between data collection and reliable analysis, providing essential knowledge for correct interpretation. By clarifying key concepts and common practices, this work supports improved accuracy in surface chemical characterization using XPS.</p>

            <h2>Intriguing Magnetocaloric Effect in 6H-perovskite Ba3RRu2O9 (R=Ho, Gd, Tb, Nd) with Strong 4d-4f Correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohit Kumar, Sayan Ghosh, Gourab Roy, Ekta Kushwaha, Vincent Caignaert, Wilfrid Prellier, Subham Majumdar, Vincent Hardy, Tathamay Basu</p>
            <p>Here we demonstrate the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of a 4d-4f correlated system, namely Ba3RRu2O9 (R= Ho, Gd, Tb, Nd). The compound Ba3HoRu2O9 antiferromagnetically orders at 50 K where both the Ho and Ru-moments order, followed by another phase transition ~ 10 K. Whereas, the compound Ba3GdRu2O9 and Ba3TbRu2O9 orders at 14.5 and 10.5 K respectively, where the ordering of both R and Ru moments are speculated. Our results reveal robust MCE around low-T magnetic phase transition for all the heavy rare-earth members (Ho, Gd, Tb) in this family. The heavy rare-earth members exhibit an intriguing MCE behavior switching from conventional to non-conventional MCE. Interestingly, the light R-member, Ba3NdRu2O9, orders ferromagnetically below 24 K where Nd-moments order, followed by Ru-ordering below 18 K, exhibits a positive MCE below and above FM-ordering. The compelling MCE are attributed to temperature dependent complex spin-reorientations for different R-members and anisotropy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Jiménez-Flores, A. Rodríguez-Rivas, J. M. Romero-Enrique</p>
            <p>In this paper, we report a Brownian dynamics simulation of the mobility-induced phase separation which occurs in a two-dimensional binary mixture of active soft Brownian particles, whose interactions are modeled by non-additive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potentials inspired in Lennard-Jones potentials used for glass-forming passive mixtures. The analysis of structural properties, such as the radial distribution functions and the hexatic order parameter, shows that the high-density coexisting state in the binary case is spatially disordered, unlike the solid-like state observed for the monocomponent system. Characterization of the mean-square displacement of the active particles shows that both the low- and high-density coexisting states have diffusive behavior for long times. Thus, the high-density coexisting states are liquid-like in the binary cases. Moreover, diffusive behavior is also observed in the high-density solid-like state for the monocomponent system, which is driven by the presence of active topological defects.</p>

            <h2>Temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization of Ni2MnGa and other ferromagnets. The superellipse equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Perevertov</p>
            <p>The temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization of Ni2MnGa and other ferromagnets can be described in reduced coordinates by the superellipse equation using a single dimensionless parameter. This critical exponent parameter equals 2.4 for Ni2MnGa, 2.7 for nickel and cobalt, and 3.0 for iron. Because reduced magnetization and reduced temperature enter the equation symmetrically, the Ms(T) dependence can be measured experimentally only in the low-temperature range, from 0 to 0.5TC. The magnetization curve from 0.5TC to TC can then be obtained by interchanging reduced magnetization and temperature in the superellipse equation. In this way, the experimentally challenging task of measuring spontaneous magnetization near Tc is avoided, as the behavior near Tc is effectively determined from measurements performed near T = 0.</p>

            <p>In this study, novel exact solutions of the Duffing equation with their phase portraits have been proposed and reasoned. It is shown that phase trajectories are initially elliptical and become distorted in the unstable area within the growth of the variable parameter. Instability criteria of identified solutions have been determined together with the Fourier series transformation up to the first and high harmonics in a sense of the physical interpretation. An explicit form for the differential operator, corresponding to considered functions, has been derived with evaluation of its main functional spectrum. Non-isothermal creep tests of different materials were completely described using the Duffing equation via noted solutions up to the fracture as processes with personal deformation response. We successfully examined a relationship between the thermal and magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic amorphous alloy under its non-linear deformation, using the critical exponents. With a high linear correlation between our model and experiments, behaviour of organic and metallic systems is well predicted at the same thermo-mechanical testing conditions on the mesoscale.</p>

            <h2>Quasiparticle Dynamics in the 4d-4f Ising-like Double Perovskite Ba2DyRuO6 Probed by Neutron Scattering and Machine-Learning Framework</h2>

            <p>Double perovskites containing 4d--4f interactions provide a platform to study complex magnetic phenomena in correlated systems. Here, we investigate the magnetic ground state and quasiparticle excitations of the fascinating double perovskite system, Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$, through Time of flight (TOF) neutron diffraction (TOF), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and theoretical modelling. The compound Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$ is reported to exhibit a single magnetic transition, in sharp contrast to most of the other rare-earth (R) members in this family, A$_2$RRuO$_6$ (A = Ca/Sr/Ba), which typically show magnetic ordering of the Ru ions, followed by R-ion ordering. Our neutron diffraction results confirm that long-range antiferromagnetic order emerges at $T_\mathrm{N} \approx 47$~K, primarily driven by 4d--4f Ru$^{5+}$--Dy$^{3+}$ exchange interactions, where both Dy and Ru moments start to order simultaneously. The ordered ground state is a collinear antiferromagnet with Ising character, carrying ordered moments of $\mu_{\mathrm{Ru}} = 1.6(1)~\mu_\mathrm{B}$ and $\mu_{\mathrm{Dy}} = 5.1(1)~\mu_\mathrm{B}$ at 1.5~K. Low-temperature INS reveals well-defined magnon excitations below 10~meV. SpinW modelling of the INS spectra evidences complex exchange interactions and the presence of magnetic anisotropy, which governs the Ising ground state and accounts for the observed magnon spectrum. Combined INS and Raman spectroscopy reveal crystal-electric-field (CEF) excitations of Dy$^{3+}$ at 46.5 and 71.8~meV in the paramagnetic region. The observed CEF levels are reproduced by point-charge calculations consistent with the $O_h$ symmetry of Dy$^{3+}$. A complementary machine-learning approach is used to analyse the phonon spectrum and compare with INS data. Together, these results clarify the origin of phonon and magnon excitations and their role in the ground-state magnetism of Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liheng Yao, Michael E. Cates, Robert L. Jack</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamical pathways of a geometric phase transition in a two-dimensional active lattice gas undergoing motility-induced phase separation. The transition is between metastable morphologies of the liquid cluster: a system-spanning "slab" and a compact "droplet". We generate trajectories of this transition in both directions using forward flux sampling. We find that the droplet-to-slab transition always follows a similar mechanism to its equilibrium counterpart, but the reverse (slab-to-droplet) transition depends on rare non-equilibrium fluctuations. At low Peclet numbers the equilibrium and non-equilibrium pathways compete, while at high Peclet numbers the equilibrium pathway is entirely suppressed, and the only allowed mechanism involves a large vapour bubble. We discuss the implications of these findings for active matter systems more generally.</p>

            <h2>Active phase separation: role of attractive interactions from stalled particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kingshuk Panja, Rajesh Singh</p>
            <p>Dry active matter systems are well-known to exhibit Motility-Induced Phase Separation (MIPS). However, in wet active systems, attractive hydrodynamic interactions mediated by active particles stalled at a boundary can introduce complementary mechanisms for aggregation. In the work of Caciagli et al. (PRL 125, 068001, 2020), it was shown that the attractive hydrodynamic interactions due to active particles stalled at a boundary can be described in terms of an effective potential. In this paper, we present a model of active Brownian particles, where a fraction of active particles are stalled, and thus, mediate inter-particle interactions through the effective potential. Our investigation of the model reveals that a small fraction of stalled particles in the system allows for the formation of dynamical clusters at significantly lower densities than predicted by standard MIPS. We provide a comprehensive phase diagram in terms of weighted average cluster sizes that is mapped in the plane of the fraction of stalled particles ($\alpha$) and the Peclet number. Our findings demonstrate that even a marginal value of $\alpha$ is sufficient to drive phase separation at low global densities, bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental observations of dilute active systems.</p>

            <p>We present a generalizable scale-bridging computational framework that enables predictive modeling of insertion-type electrode materials from atomistic to device scales. Applied to sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, a promising cathode material for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries, our methodology employs an active-learning strategy to train a Moment Tensor Potential through iterative hybrid grand-canonical Monte Carlo--molecular dynamics sampling, robustly capturing configuration spaces at all sodiation levels. The resulting machine learning interatomic potential accurately reproduces experimental properties including volume expansion, operating voltage, and sodium concentration-dependent structural transformations, while revealing a four-order-of-magnitude difference in sodium diffusivity between the rhombohedral (sodium-rich) and tetragonal (sodium-poor) phases at 300 K. We directly compute all critical parameters -- temperature- and concentration-dependent diffusivities, interfacial and strain energies, and complete free-energy landscapes -- to feed them into pseudo-2D phase-field simulations that predict phase-boundary propagation and rate-dependent performances across electrode length scales. This multiscale workflow establishes a blueprint for rational computational design of next-generation insertion-type materials, such as battery electrode materials, demonstrating how atomistic insights can be systematically translated into continuum-scale predictions.</p>

            <p>We comprehensively study the unconventional pairing and collective modes in the multiband kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=$\mathrm{K},\mathrm{Cs},\mathrm{Rb}$). By solving gap equations at zero temperature, we identify a transition from normal $s++/s\pm$-wave pairing to time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking pairing with a variation of inter-pocket interactions or density of states. This TRS breaking pairing originates from the superconducting phase frustration of different Fermi pockets and can account for experimental TRS breaking signal in kagome superconductors. Moreover, we investigate collective modes, including the Higgs, Leggett, and Bogoloubov-Anderson-Goldstone modes, arising from fluctuations of the amplitude, relative phase, and overall phase of the superconducting order parameters, respectively. Remarkably, due to the presence of multibands, one branch of the Leggett modes becomes nearly massless near the TRS breaking transition, providing a compelling smoking-gun signature of TRS-breaking superconductivity, in clear contrast to TRS-breaking charge orders. Our results elucidate the rich superconducting physics and its associated collective modes in kagome metals, and suggest feasible experimental detection of TRS breaking pairing.</p>

            <h2>SSCHA-based evolutionary crystal structure prediction at finite temperatures with account for quantum nuclear motion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniil Poletaev, Artem Oganov</p>
            <p>Accurate crystal structure prediction (CSP) at finite temperatures with quantum anharmonic effects remains challenging but very prominent in systems with lightweight atoms such as superconducting hydrides. In this work, we integrate machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) to enable evolutionary CSP on the quantum anharmonic free-energy landscape. Using LaH$_{10}$ at 150 GPa and 300 K as a test case, we compare two approaches for SSCHA-based CSP: using light-weight active-learning MLIPs (AL-MLIPs) trained on-the-fly from scratch, and foundation models or universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) from the Matbench project. We demonstrate that AL-MLIPs allow to correctly predict the experimentally known cubic Fm$\bar{3}$m phase as the most stable polymorph at 150 GPa but require corrections within the thermodynamic perturbation theory to get consistent results. The uMLIP Mattersim-5m allow to conduct SSCHA-based CSP without requiring per-structure training and even get correct structure ranking near the global minimum, though fine-tuning may be needed for higher accuracy. Our results show that including quantum anharmonicity simplifies the free-energy landscape and is essential for correct stability rankings, that is especially important for high-temperature phases that could be missed in classical 0 K CSP. The proposed approach extends the reach of CSP to systems where quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity dominate.</p>

            <h2>Regularized universal topological local markers for Dirac systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yulin Qin, Chang-An Li, Jian Li</p>
            <p>Local markers provide an efficient and powerful characterization of topological features of many systems, especially when the translation symmetry is broken. Recently, a universal topological local marker applicable in different symmetry classes of topological systems is proposed. However, it suffers from irregular behaviors at the boundary and its connection to other topological indexes remains elusive. In this work, we construct regularized universal topological local markers that apply to Dirac systems by utilizing position operators that are compatible with periodic boundary conditions. The regularized local markers eliminate the obstructive boundary irregularities successfully, and give rise to the desired global topological invariants such as the Chern number consistently when integrated over all the lattice sites. Furthermore, the regularized form allows us to establish an explicit connection between the local markers and some other known topological indices in two dimensions. For instance, it turns out to be equivalent to the Bott index in classes A, D, and C, and equivalent to the spin Chern number in classes DIII and AII. We further examine the utility and stability of this new marker in disordered scenarios. We find that its variance shows peaks at the phase boundaries, which promotes it as a useful indicator for detecting disorder-induced topological phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Improving hydrogen storage density is essential for reducing the extreme conditions required in applications such as nuclear fusion. However, the recognition of metallic hydrogen as the "Holy Grail" of high-pressure science highlights the difficulty of high-density hydrogen aggregation. Here, we report a solid-state crystal H9@C20 formed by embedding hydrogen atoms into C20 fullerene cages and utilizing chemical precompression, which remains stable under ambient pressure and temperature conditions and exhibits metallic properties. This precompression effect is reflected in the formation of C-H bonds within the cage and C-C bonds between cages, resulting in the transformation of all C atoms from sp2 to sp3 hybridization with inward and outward distortions, while promoting delocalized multicenter bonding within the H9 aggregate. In particular, the hydrogen density inside the C20 cage exceeds that of solid hydrogen, achieving a uniform discrete distribution with H9 as monomers. Further study reveals that filling hydrogen molecules into voids between H9@C20 primitive cells can increase hydrogen content while maintaining structural stability, forming a solid-gas mixed hydrogen storage crystal. Our findings provide a basis for developing high-density hydrogen storage materials under ambient conditions.</p>

            <p>Linking entropy production (EP) to information is a key step toward data-driven nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We derive an exact identity for overdamped Langevin dynamics that equates the total EP rate to the mutual-information rate between an infinitesimal displacement and its time-symmetric midpoint, up to a bulk mean-flow contribution. This mapping elevates information theory to a thermodynamic calculus: the chain rule yields a canonical, nonnegative split into self and interaction EP, and leads to a tighter bound on learning rate with interaction EP as the necessary cost. As a proof of concept, applying the estimator to red-blood-cell flickering shows that interaction EP robustly exposes active signatures that conventional summaries can miss.</p>

By probing the supercooled and glassy regimes, we characterize the relationship between structure and dynamics as a function of effective volume fraction $\phi$ and probed length scale. We demonstrate that ULC microgels act as fragile glass formers whose dynamics are governed solely by $\phi$. In contrast, the microscopic structure depends on the specific combination of microgel number density and swelling state that define $\phi$. We identify an anomalous glassy regime where relaxation times are orders of magnitude faster than predicted by supercooled extrapolations, and show that in this regime dynamics are partly accelerated by laser light absorption. Finally, we show that the microscopic relaxation time measured for different $\phi$'s and at various scattering vectors may be rationalized by a ``time-length scale superposition principle'' analogous to the time-temperature superposition used to scale onto a master curve rheology or dielectric relaxation data of molecular systems. Remarkably, we find that the resulting master curve also applies to a different microgel system [V.

            <p>The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$\mu$\si{\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \pm 38)$~\si{\nano\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) metallic systems with intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity are rare, yet they are of great interest for next-generation energy and electronic technologies. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of monolayer tin telluride (SnTe2) in its 1T (CdI2-type, P3m1) structure. Our calculations establish its energetic and dynamical stability, confirmed by large cohesive (10.9 eV/atom) and formation (-4.06 eV/atom) energies and a phonon spectrum free of imaginary modes. The electronic band structure reveals metallicity arising from strong Sn-Te p orbital hybridization. Most importantly, phonon dispersion analysis uncovers a microscopic origin for the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity: the heavy mass of Te atoms, weak Sn-Te bonding, and flat acoustic branches that yield exceptionally low and anisotropic group velocities (~5.0 x 10^3 m/s), together with the absence of a phonon bandgap that enhances Umklapp scattering. These features converge to suppress phonon-mediated heat transport. Complementary calculations of the optical dielectric response and joint density of states reveal pronounced interband transitions and a plasmonic resonance near 4.84 eV, suggesting additional optoelectronic opportunities. These findings establish monolayer SnTe2 as a 2D material whose vibrational softness naturally enforces ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, underscoring its potential for thermoelectric applications.</p>

The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.</p>

            <p>The graphicality problem -- whether or not a sequence of integers can be used to create a simple graph -- is a key question in network theory and combinatorics, with many important practical applications. In this work, we study the graphicality of degree sequences distributed as a power-law with a size-dependent cutoff and as a double power-law with a size-dependent crossover. We combine the application of exact sufficient conditions for graphicality with heuristic conditions for nongraphicality which allow us to elucidate the physical reasons why some sequences are not graphical. For single power-laws we recover the known phase-diagram, we highlight the subtle interplay of distinct mechanisms violating graphicality and we explain why the infinite-size limit behavior is in some cases very far from being observed for finite sequences. For double power-laws we derive the graphicality of infinite sequences for all possible values of the degree exponents $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$, uncovering a rich phase-diagram and pointing out the existence of five qualitatively distinct ways graphicality can be violated. The validity of theoretical arguments is supported by extensive numerical analysis.</p>

            <p>Materials in which electrons occupy interstitial sites as anions are called electrides and exhibit unusual dimensionality-dependent electronic behavior. These properties make electrides attractive for catalysis, transparent conductors, and emergent quantum phenomena, yet their theoretical treatment remains challenging. In conventional materials, the ground-state atomic structure dictates the electronic configuration, whereas in electrides the electronic structure can instead govern the atomic arrangement. Here, the performance of commonly used exchange-correlation functionals is evaluated for representative one-, two-, and three-dimensional electrides. The results show that higher-cost approaches do not necessarily perform better across all cases, while standard methods capture the qualitative electride character and many key energetic and structural trends with surprising reliability. This behavior, likely arising from fortuitous error cancellation, supports the reliability of legacy studies in the field and the viability of efficient high-throughput exploration using low-cost methods. Overall, the findings support a tiered computational strategy for electride modelling, integrating system-specific heuristics with efficient first-principles screening. This approach balances computational feasibility with physical fidelity and underscores the continuing leadership of theory in the predictive discovery of electride materials across dimensionalities.</p>

            <h2>Numerical study of boson mixtures with multi-component continuous matrix product states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Tang, Benoît Tuybens, Jutho Haegeman</p>
            <p>The continuous matrix product state (cMPS) ansatz is a promising numerical tool for studying quantum many-body systems in continuous space. Although it provides a clean framework that allows one to directly simulate continuous systems, the optimization of cMPS is known to be a very challenging task, especially in the case of multi-component systems. In this work, we have developed an improved optimization scheme for multi-component cMPS that enables simulations of bosonic quantum mixtures with substantially larger bond dimensions than previous works. We benchmark our method on the two-component Lieb-Liniger model, obtaining numerical results that agree well with analytical predictions. Our work paves the way for further numerical studies of quantum mixture systems using the cMPS ansatz.</p>

            <h2>Parity order as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashirbad Padhan, Harsh Nigam</p>
            <p>Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in interacting bosonic systems have been extensively studied, yet most realizations rely on fine-tuned interactions or enlarged symmetries. Here we show that a qualitatively different mechanism--parity order coupled to bond dimerization--acts as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify two distinct topological phases absent in the purely dimerized model: an SPT phase at half filling stabilized by positive parity coupling, and a topological phase at unit filling stabilized by negative coupling that can be adiabatically connected to a trivial phase without breaking any symmetry. Our results establish parity order as a new organizing principle for correlation-driven bosonic topology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. L. Iguain, F. O. Sanchez-Varreti, M. A. Frechero</p>
            <p>We present a systematic characterization of the fractal conduction pathways governing ionic transport in a non-crystalline solid below the glass-transition temperature. Using classical molecular dynamics simulations of lithium metasilicate, we combine mobility-resolved dynamical analysis with a real-space description of the regions explored by lithium ions. Ensemble-averaged velocity autocorrelation functions rapidly decorrelate and do not resolve the pronounced dynamic heterogeneity of the system, whereas single-ion analysis reveals short-lived episodes of nearly collinear motion. By mapping active-site clusters over increasing time windows, we show that ion-conducting pathways are quasi one-dimensional at short times and evolve into larger, branched structures characterized by a robust fractal dimension $d_f\simeq1.7$. This geometry persists while the silicate backbone remains structurally arrested, whereas near the glass-transition temperature the loss of structural memory leads to the reappearance of small clusters. These results provide a real-space structural interpretation of ionic transport in non-crystalline solids and support fractal pathway models of high-frequency ionic response.</p>

            <p>Strange metals represent a foundational problem in quantum condensed matter physics, and heavy fermion systems provide a canonical setting to advance a general understanding. The concept of a Kondo destruction quantum critical point is widely invoked to describe the competition of the Kondo effect and the local-moment magnetism. Here, we develop a unified field-theoretic approach, analyzing this competition from a rare approach that is anchored by the magnetically ordered side. Our analysis reveals, for the first time within a renormalization group framework, a quantum critical point across which the Kondo effect goes from being destroyed to dominating. Our findings elucidate not only the Kondo destruction quantum criticality but also an accompanying global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals.</p>

            <p>Supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFTs) form a unique subset of quantum field theories which provide powerful insights into strongly coupled critical phenomena. Here, we present a microscopic and non-perturbative realization of the three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal Ising critical point, based on a Yukawa-type coupling between a 3D Ising CFT and a gauged Majorana fermion. Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level. Our results establish a controlled, non-perturbative microscopic route to 3D SCFTs.</p>

            <p>Reliable constraints on iron's melting curve at Earth's inner-core boundary require accurate finite-temperature electronic correlations, yet DFT+DMFT calculations remain too costly for large-scale thermodynamic sampling. Here, we develop a machine-learning accelerator for charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT by training E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks to predict the local self-energy and Fermi level from atomic environments, providing an efficient warm start to the DMFT self-consistency loop. Using high-throughput data for Fe, FeO, and NiO, we obtain a 2-4 times reuduction in DMFT iterations. Leveraging this improvement, we generate correlated energies and forces for Fe at core pressures, train a neural-network interatomic potential, and determine the melting curve via two-phase coexistence simulations. We obtain a predicted melting temperature of 6225 K at 330 GPa.</p>

            <h2>Classification of Interacting Topological Crystalline Superconductors in Three Dimensions and Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shang-Qiang Ning, Xing-Yu Ren, Qing-Rui Wang, Yang Qi, Zheng-Cheng Gu</p>
            <p>Although classification for free-fermion topological superconductors (TSC) is established, systematically understanding the classification of 3D interacting TSCs remains difficult, especially those protected by crystalline symmetries like the 230 space groups. We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discrete internal symmetries. We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, \nu_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\times_{\omega_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones. We explicitly obtain formulas for all three layers of decoration $(n_2, n_3, \nu_4)$, which are amenable to automatic computation. As an application, we classify the 230 space-group topological crystalline superconductors in interacting electronic systems.</p>

            <h2>Randomization Times under Quantum Chaotic Hamiltonian Evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Souradeep Ghosh, Nicholas Hunter-Jones, Joaquin F. Rodriguez-Nieva</p>
            <p>Randomness generation through quantum-chaotic evolution underpins foundational questions in statistical mechanics and applications across quantum information science, including benchmarking, tomography, metrology, and demonstrations of quantum computational advantage. While statistical mechanics successfully captures the temporal averages of local observables, understanding randomness at the level of higher statistical moments remains a daunting challenge, with analytic progress largely confined to random quantum circuit models or fine-tuned systems exhibiting space-time duality. Here we study how much randomness can be dynamically generated by generic quantum-chaotic evolution under physical, non-random Hamiltonians. Combining theoretical insights with numerical simulations, we show that for broad classes of initially unentangled states, the dynamics become effectively Haar-random well before the system can ergodically explore the physically accessible Hilbert space. Both local and highly nonlocal observables, including entanglement measures, equilibrate to their Haar expectation values and fluctuations on polynomial timescales with remarkably high numerical precision, and with the fastest randomization occurring in regions of parameter space previously identified as maximally chaotic. Interestingly, this effective randomization can occur on timescales linear in system size, suggesting that the sub-ballistic growth of Renyi entropies typically observed in systems with conservation laws can be bypassed in non-random Hamiltonians with an appropriate choice of initial conditions.</p>

            <p>Over the last decade, dendrites within individual biological neurons, which were previously thought to generally perform information pooling and networking, have now been shown to express complex temporal dynamics, Boolean-like logic, arithmetic, signal discrimination, and edge detection for image and sound recognition. Mimicking this rich functional density could offer a powerful primitive for neuromorphic computing, which has sought to replace the aging digital computing paradigms using biological inspirations. Here, using electrically driven Ovonic threshold switching in Sb-Te-doped GeSe, we demonstrate a single two-terminal component capable of self-sustained dynamics and universal Boolean logic, in addition to XOR operations (which is traditionally thought to require a network of active components). We then employ logic-driven dynamics in a single component to detect and estimate the gradients of edges in images, a task that otherwise requires elaborate circuits. A network of Ovonic switches exhibits properties of a half adder and a full adder, in addition to discriminative logic accommodating inhibitory and excitatory signals. We show that this computational primitive is not only seemingly simpler, but also offers many orders of magnitude improved energy efficiency compared to prevailing digital solutions. As such, this work paves the path for potentially emulating dendrites for efficient post-digital neuromorphic computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Walter D. Goldberger, Petar Tadić</p>
            <p>We study the quantum field theory of zero temperature perfect fluids. Such systems are defined by quantizing a classical field theory of scalar fields $\phi^I$ that act as Lagrange coordinates on an internal spatial manifold of fluid configurations. Invariance under volume preserving diffeomorphisms acting on these scalars implies that the long-wavelength spectrum contains vortex (transverse modes) with exact $\omega_T=0$ dispersion relation. As a result, physically interpreting the perturbative quantization of this theory by standard methods has proven to be challenging. In this paper, we show that correlators evaluated in the class of semi-classical (Gaussian) initial states prepared at $t=0$ are well-defined and accessible via perturbation theory. The width of the initial state effectively acts as an infrared regulator without explicitly breaking diffeomorphism invariance. As an application, we compute stress tensor two-point correlators and show that vortex modes give a non-trivial contribution to the response function, non-local in both space and time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Monti, Peter Yatsyshin, Konstantinos Gkagkas, Andrew B. Duncan</p>
            <p>Predicting interfacial thermodynamics across molecular and continuum scales remains a central challenge in computational science. Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a first-principles route to connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic observables, but its predictive accuracy depends on approximate free-energy functionals that are difficult to generalize. Here we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that augments cDFT with neural corrections trained directly against molecular-dynamics data through adjoint optimization. Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime. This approach combines the interpretability of statistical mechanics with the adaptability of modern machine learning, establishing a general route to learned thermodynamic functionals that bridge molecular simulations and continuum-scale models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Zhu, Poramas Komonvasee, Arman Nejad, David P. Tew</p>
            <p>We apply periodic domain-based local pair natural orbital second-order Møller--Plesset perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) to probe the adsorption energy of CO on MgO(001), the consensus toy model system for surface adsorption. A number of robust correlated wavefunction methods now achieve excellent agreement with experiment for the adsorption of a single CO molecule onto the MgO surface. However, studies probing denser coverage ratios are scarce because of the increased computational expense and the larger configuration space to optimize. We leverage the computational efficiency of periodic DLPNO-MP2 to perform simulations beyond a single unit cell. By using large supercells, we highlight the importance of accurately representing the thermodynamic limit of the surface, and demonstrate in turn that different coverage ratios can be consistently probed. In the dilute regime, we show that adsorption energies obtained from periodic DLPNO-MP2 agree with existing benchmarks. We then obtain adsorption energies at increasing densities approaching full monolayer coverage. Our results show a reduction in binding strength at full coverage, agreeing with experimental observations, which is explained by the increasing lateral repulsions between the COs. This study demonstrates the efficacy of periodic DLPNO-MP2 for probing increasingly sophisticated adsorption systems at the thermodynamic limit.</p>

CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers.

TCI provides a well-defined type system that abstracts tensor objects together with a minimal yet expressive set of core functions covering essential tensor manipulations and tensor linear-algebra operations. Through numerical demonstrations on representative tensor-network applications, we show that codes written against TCI can be migrated seamlessly across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms while achieving performance comparable to native framework implementations. We further release an open-source implementation of TCI based on \textit{Cytnx}, demonstrating its practicality and ease of integration with existing tensor-computing frameworks.</p>

            <p>First-principles simulations have played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water, and machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained on these first-principles data widen the range of accessible properties. However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.</p>

In this work, we uncover the underlying reason for the absence of these boundary conditions in counter examples, and propose a criterion diagnosing when the lore fails for any given 2d CFT.

            <p>In this short review paper the detailed analysis of six two-dimensional quantum {\it superintegrable} systems in flat space is presented. It includes the Smorodinsky-Winternitz potentials I-II (the Holt potential), the Fokas-Lagerstrom model, the 3-body Calogero and Wolfes (equivalently, $G_2$ rational, or $I_6$) models, and the Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system with integer index $k$. It is shown that all of them are exactly-solvable, thus, confirming the Montreal conjecture (2001); they admit algebraic forms for the Hamiltonian and both integrals (all three can be written as differential operators with polynomial coefficients without a constant term), they have polynomial eigenfunctions with the invariants of the discrete symmetry group of invariance taken as variables, they have hidden (Lie) algebraic structure $g^{(k)}$ with various $k$, and they possess a (finite order) polynomial algebras of integrals. Each model is characterized by infinitely-many finite-dimensional invariant subspaces, which form the infinite flag. Each subspace coincides with the finite-dimensional representation space of the algebra $g^{(k)}$ for a certain $k$. In all presented cases the algebra of integrals is a 4-generated $(H, I_1, I_2, I_{12}\equiv[I_1, I_2])$ infinite-dimensional algebra of ordered monomials of degrees 2,3,4,5, which is a subalgebra of the universal enveloping algebra of the hidden algebra.</p>

            <p>The interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to exotic dynamic phenomena that challenge conventional wave-packet propagation and entanglement dynamics. While recent studies have established the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) as a key mechanism for anomalous wave dynamics, a unified framework for characterizing and controlling entanglement evolution in non-Hermitian topological systems remains underdeveloped. Here, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that entanglement entropy (EE) and transport currents serve as robust dynamic probes to distinguish various non-Hermitian topological regimes. Using a generalized non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model implemented in an acoustic analog platform, we identify three dynamic phases, bulk-like, edge-like, and skin-like regimes, each exhibiting unique EE signatures and transport characteristics. In particular, skin-like dynamics exhibit periodic information shuttling with finite, oscillatory EE, while edge-like dynamics lead to complete EE suppression. We further map the dynamic phase diagram and show that EE scaling and temporal profiles directly reflect the competition between coherent delocalization and NHSE-driven localization. Our results establish a programmable approach to steering entanglement and transport via tailored non-Hermitian couplings, offering a pathway for engineering quantum information dynamics in synthetic phononic, photonic, and quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>We present a numerical study on the synchronization and cascade failure behaviour by solving the adaptive second-order Kuramoto model on a large high voltage (HV) European power-grid. This non-perturbative analysis takes into account non-linear effects, which occur even when phase differences are large, when the system is away from the steady state, and even during a blackout cascade. Our dynamical simulations show that improvements in the phase synchronziation stabilization as well as the in the cascade sizes can be related to the finite size scaling behaviour of the second order Kuramoto on graphs with $d_s<4$ spectral dimensions. On the other hand drawbacks in the frequency spread and Braess effects also occur by varying the total transmitted power at large and small global couplings, presumably when the fluctuations are small, causing a freezing in the dynamics. We compare simulations of the fully AC model with those of static or adaptive High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) line replacements. The adaptive (local frequency difference-based) HVDC lines are more efficient in the steady state, at the expense of very long relaxation times.</p>

            <p>The mechanical properties of actin filaments are essential to their biological functions. Here, we introduce a highly coarse-grained model of actin filaments that preserves helicity and chirality while enabling mesoscale simulations. The framework is implemented in Cytosim, an open-source cytoskeleton simulation platform. We can predict and finely control the shape and mechanical properties of this helical filament, that can be matched to experimental values. Using this model, we investigated the role of filament chirality in motor-driven dynamics. We first show that in two different experimental configurations, motor movement along a helical filament results in a chiral motion of the filament. In a bundle of helical filaments, dimeric motors exert torques on each filament, inducing collective behaviors in the bundle such as rotation, coiling, and helical buckling, reminiscent of those observed in filopodia. Together, these results demonstrate the central role of helicity and chirality in actin mechanics and motor-driven dynamics, and establish our framework as a powerful tool for mesoscale simulations. This framework can also be used for other helical filaments beyond actin.</p>

            <h2>High-flux cold lithium-6 and rubidium-87 atoms from compact two-dimensional magneto-optical traps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun-Xuan Lu, An-Wei Zhu, Christine E. Frank, Xin-Yi Huang, Xin-Yu Luo</p>
            <p>We report a compact setup with in-series two-dimensional magneto-optical traps (2D MOTs) that provides high-flux cold lithium and rubidium atoms. Thanks to the efficient short-distance Zeeman slowing, the maximum 3D MOT loading rate of lithium atoms reaches a record value of $6.6\times 10^{9}$ atoms/s at a moderate lithium-oven temperature of 372 degrees Celsius, which is 44 times higher than that without the Zeeman slowing light. The flux of rubidium is also as high as $2.3\times10^9$ atoms/s with the rubidium oven held at room temperature. Meanwhile, the entire vacuum-chamber system, including an ultra-high-vacuum science cell, is within a small volume of $55\times65\times70~\mathrm{cm}^3$. Our work represents a substantial improvement over traditional bulky and complex dual-species cold-atom setups. It provides a good starting point for the fast production of a double-degenerate lithium-rubidium atomic mixture and large samples of ultracold lithium-rubidium ground-state molecules.</p>

            <p>We show that the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) construction, also known as the topological holography, provides a natural and intuitive framework for the entropic order parameter characterising phases with (partially) broken symmetries. Various examples of group and non-invertible symmetries are studied.

            <h2>Configurational-entropy-driven structural and optical stability in high-entropy halide perovskites for broadband NIR photonics</h2>

            <p>By injecting configurational entropy into soft ionic lattices, high-entropy halide perovskites offer a compelling route toward photonic materials that are both functionally rich and operationally robust; however, converting compositional complexity into predictable optical function remains challenging. Here we demonstrate device-relevant ultrabroadband near-infrared (NIR) photonics by integrating element-specific roles within an entropy-stabilized lattice. We establish high-entropy rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb,Re)Cl6 (Re3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), where near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase cubic solid solution (S_config about 1.6R) with homogeneous multication incorporation. Sb3+ acts as a broadband sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide emitters, transforming single-mode emission into wide-coverage NIR output (850-1600 nm) with three fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced signature enables redundancy-based ratiometric readout with reduced sensitivity to intensity drift, supporting reliable solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing. Beyond functional expansion, accelerated aging tests show markedly improved tolerance to humidity and oxygen versus single-component analogues. The robustness is experimentally attributed to octahedral contraction-strengthened metal-halide bonding that increases the kinetic barrier for moisture-triggered bond cleavage, together with entropy-induced lattice distortion that impedes long-range halide migration and suppresses defect/impurity-phase formation. Finally, a UV-pumped phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, wide-coverage NIR illumination, highlighting configurational-entropy engineering as a practical strategy to couple ultrabroadband photonic function with environmental stability.</p>

            <h2>Analytical phase kurtosis of the constant gradient spin echo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teddy X Cai, Nathan H Williamson, Peter J Basser</p>
            <p>The Gaussian phase approximation (GPA) underlies many standard diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) signal models, yet its validity is rarely scrutinized. Here, we assess the validity of the GPA by analytically deriving the excess phase kurtosis $\kappa_4/\kappa_2^2$, where $\kappa_n$ is the $n^{\text{th}}$ cumulant of the accumulated phase distribution due to motion. We consider the signal behavior of the spin echo with constant gradient amplitude $g$ and echo time $T$ in several one-dimensional model systems: (1) a stationary Poisson pore-hopping model with uniform pore spacing $\Delta x$ and mean inter-hop time $\tau_{\text{hop}}$; (2) a trapped-release model in which spin isochromats are initially immobilized and then released with diffusivity $D$ following an exponentially-distributed release time, $\tau_{\text{rel}}$; and (3) restricted diffusion in a domain of length $L$. To our knowledge, this is among the first systematic analytical treatments of spin echo phase kurtosis without assuming Gaussian compartments or infinitesimally short gradient pulses. In the pore-hopping system, $\kappa_4/\kappa^2_2 = (9/5)\tau_{\text{hop}}/T$, inversely proportional to the mean hop number, $T/\tau_{\text{hop}}$. In the trapped-release system, $\kappa_4/\kappa_2^2$ is positive and decreases roughly log-linearly with $T/\langle\tau_{\text{rel}}\rangle$, where $\langle\tau_{\text{rel}}\rangle$ is the average release time. For restriction, $\kappa_4/\kappa_2^2$ vanishes at small and large $L/\sqrt{DT}$, but has complicated intermediate behavior. There is a negative peak at $L/\sqrt{DT}\approx 1.2$ and a positive peak at $L/\sqrt{DT}\approx 4.4$. Monte Carlo simulations are included to validate the analytical findings. Overall, we find that the GPA does not generally hold for these systems under moderate experimental conditions, i.e., $T=10\;\mathrm{ms}$, $g\approx 0.2-0.6\;\mathrm{T/m}$.</p>

            <p>Many advanced energy harvesting technologies rely on advanced control of thermal emission. Recently, it has been shown that the emissivity and absorptivity of thermal emitters can be controlled independently in nonreciprocal emitters. While significant progress has been made in engineering these nonreciprocal thermal emitters, realizing a highly efficient, pattern-free emitter capable of supporting dual-polarization nonreciprocal emission remains a challenging task. Existing solutions are largely based on metamaterials and exhibit polarization-dependent behavior. This work proposes pattern-free multilayer heterostructures combining magneto-optical and magnetic Weyl semimetal materials and systematically evaluates their nonreciprocal emission performance for p- and s-polarized waves. The findings show that omnidirectional polarization-independent nonreciprocity can be achieved utilizing multilayer structures with different magnetization directions that do not follow simple vector summation. To further enhance the performance, Pareto optimization is employed to tune the key design parameters, enabling the maximization of nonreciprocal thermal emission in a given wavelength range. This approach offers a versatile strategy for designing high-performance thermal emitters tailored for multi-objective optical functionalities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yevgeny Bar Lev, Jad C. Halimeh, Achilleas Lazarides</p>
            <p>With the advent of quantum simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is the effect of non-Hermiticity on their rich physics. The well-known PXP model, a U$(1)$ LGT with a two-level electric field in one spatial dimension, has become a paradigm of exotic physics in and out of equilibrium. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian version in which the spin-flip rate differs between the two spin directions. While the naive expectation is that non-Hermiticity might suppress coherent phenomena such as quantum many-body scars, we find that when the facilitating direction of the spin is disfavored, the oscillations are instead \emph{enhanced}, decaying much slower than in the PXP limit. We demonstrate that this can be understood through a similarity transformation that maps our model to the standard PXP model, revealing that the oscillations are enhanced versions of the PXP scars. Our work provides an analytically tractable and conceptually simple example where non-Hermiticity enhances the stability of dynamically non-trivial coherent many-body modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clay Cordova, Diego García-Sepúlveda, Jeffrey A. Harvey</p>
            <p>We study the interplay between holomorphic conformal field theory and dualities of 3D topological quantum field theories generalizing the paradigm of level-rank duality. A holomorphic conformal field theory with a Kac-Moody subalgebra implies a topological interface between Chern-Simons gauge theories. Upon condensing a suitable set of anyons, such an interface yields a duality between topological field theories. We illustrate this idea using the $c=24$ holomorphic theories classified by Schellekens, which leads to a list of novel sporadic dualities. Some of these dualities necessarily involve condensation of anyons with non-abelian statistics, i.e. gauging non-invertible one-form global symmetries. Several of the examples we discover generalize from $c=24$ to an infinite series. This includes the fact that Spin$(n^{2})_{2}$ is dual to a twisted dihedral group gauge theory. Finally, if $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $k$, we deduce the existence of a sequence of holomorphic CFTs at central charge $c=2(k-1)$ with fusion category symmetry given by $\mathrm{Spin}(k)_{2}$ or equivalently, the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-equivariantization of a Tambara-Yamagami fusion category.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siamak Taati, Jacek Miȩkisz</p>
            <p>We construct a four-dimensional lattice-gas model with finite-range interactions that has non-periodic, ``quasicrystalline'' Gibbs states at low temperatures. Such Gibbs states are probability measures which are small perturbations of non-periodic ground-state configurations corresponding to tilings of the plane with Ammann's aperiodic tiles. Our construction is based on the correspondence between probabilistic cellular automata and Gibbs measures on their space-time trajectories, and a classical result on noise-resilient computing with cellular automata. The cellular automaton is constructed on the basis of Ammann's tiles, which are deterministic in one direction, and has non-periodic space-time trajectories corresponding to each valid tiling. Repetitions along two extra dimensions, together with an error-correction mechanism, ensure stability of the trajectories subjected to noise.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Foster Thompson, Daniel K. J. Boneß, Mark Dykman, Alex Kamenev</p>
            <p>Parametrically driven oscillators can emerge as a basis for the next generation of qubits. Classically, these systems exhibit two stable oscillatory states with opposite phases. Upon quantization, these states turn into a pair of closely spaced Floquet states, which can serve as the logical basis for a qubit. However, interaction with the environment induces phase-slip events which set a limit on qubit coherence. Such phase slips persist even at zero temperature due to a mechanism known as quantum activation \cite{QuantumActivation}. In contrast to conventional tunneling, the quantum activation is described by a {\em real-time} instanton trajectory in the complexified phase space of the system. In this work, we show that the phase-slip rate is exponentially sensitive to weak AC perturbations. The spectrum of the system's response -- captured by the so-called logarithmic susceptibility (LS) -- enables a direct observation of characteristic features of real-time instantons. Studying this spectrum suggests new means of efficient qubit control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cyril Metzger, Alec L. Emser, Brendon C. Rose, Konrad W. Lehnert</p>
            <p>We present experimental evidence of a thermally-driven amplitude-frequency nonlinearity in a thin-film quartz phononic crystal resonator at millikelvin temperatures. The nonlinear response arises from the coupling of the mechanical mode to an ensemble of microscopic two-level system defects driven out of equilibrium by a microwave drive. In contrast to the conventional Duffing oscillator, the observed nonlinearity exhibits a mixed reactive-dissipative character. Notably, the reactive effect can manifest as either a softening or hardening of the mechanical resonance, depending on the ratio of thermal to phonon energy. By combining the standard TLS theory with a thermal conductance model, the measured power-dependent response is quantitatively reproduced and readout-enhanced relaxation damping from off-resonant TLSs is identified as the primary mechanism limiting mechanical coherence. Within this framework, we delineate the conditions under which similar systems will realize this nonlinearity.</p>

The nanoscale photocarrier transport, trapping, and recombination mechanisms are usually inferred from ensemble-averaged measurements and remain elusive. Because an individual high-performing nanoparticle photocatalyst may outperform the ensemble average, design rules that would otherwise enhance catalytic efficiency remain unclear. Here, we introduce photomodulated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an optically coupled scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to map photocarrier localization. Using rhodium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Rh) solar water-splitting nanoparticles, we directly image the carrier densities concentrated at oxygen-vacancy surface trap states. This is achieved by separating photothermal heating from photocarrier populations through experimental and computational analyses of low-loss spectra. Photomodulated STEM-EELS enables angstrom-scale imaging of defect-induced photocarrier traps and their impact on photocatalytic efficiency.</p>

            <p>Neural quantum states efficiently represent many-body wavefunctions with neural networks, but the cost of Monte Carlo sampling limits their scaling to large system sizes. Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures.</p>

We also discuss the consequences of this for finding efficient measurement circuits in variational ground state preparation.</p>

We present a Ramsey/echo interferometric protocol that measures the Wilson loop trace of the Wilczek--Zee connection for a control cycle, providing a gauge-invariant signature of the non-Abelian holonomy.

            <p>Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</p>

The gradient expansion includes an unexpected zeroth order term depending on the differences between thermo-hydrodynamic fields at the decoupling and the initial hypersurface. This term encodes a memory of the initial state which is related to the long-distance persistence of the correlation function between Wigner operator and stress-energy tensor and charged current that is discussed in detail.

            <p>We predict two different universal scaling regimes for the quantum transmission of metallic nanodevices following the addition of a small amount of uncorrelated disorder. A nanodevice is connected to two thin semi-infinite uniform leads, and the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) methodology yields the electron transmission ${\cal T}(E)$ as a function of the injected electron energy $E$. Ballistic nanodevices have no disorder and have ${\cal T}(E)=1$ for all $E$ that allow electron propagation in the leads. Quantum dragon nanodevices can have extremely strong properly correlated disorder, and still have ${\cal T}(E)=1$ for all $E$. Additional uncorrelated site disorder leads to Fano resonances in ${\cal T}(E)$. Averaging over the uncorrelated disorder we predict using perturbation theory two universal scaling regimes for ${\cal T}_{\rm ave}(E)$. The functional form of both universal scaling regimes depend on the device length and width, energy, and variance of the uncorrelated disorder. The second scaling regime, valid for small but somewhat larger uncorrelated disorder than the first scaling regime, also has the form dependent on the density of states of the system. These two scaling regimes are demonstrated to be valid via large scale computer calculations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady-state properties of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain using a self-consistent Gutzwiller mean-field (GMF) approach. By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.</p>

When one enters from Fermi Liquid to Dirac Fluid domain, Lorenz ratio becomes less than one in non-fluid framework but in fluid framework, it always remain greater than one for both domain. By compiling our outcomes and connecting with experimental data, a non-fluid to fluid transition framework is expected during the transition from Fermi Liquid to Dirac Fluid domain.</p>

            <p>A long-standing challenge in impact mitigation is the development of versatile and omnifarious protective structures capable of encompassing a wide spectrum of scenarios, for example, ranging from low-speed pedestrian impacts to high-speed vehicle collisions. However, most existing impact mitigation strategies rely on fixed geometries or pre-tuned material properties targeting specific impact speed, lacking the ability to adapt in real time. Here, we draw inspiration from origami to design impact mitigation structures that exhibit multi-modal and self-adaptive behavior. We introduce a Resch-patterned origami structure that hosts two distinctive deformation modes: a monostable folding mode and a bistable unfolding mode featuring snap-through. Impact experiments reveal a speed-dependent dynamic bifurcation, wherein the structure autonomously switches between folding and unfolding in response to the applied impact velocity. This dynamic bifurcation, intrinsically distinct from kinematic or static origami bifurcations, enables real-time selection of deformation pathways that enhance energy dissipation across a broad range of impact conditions. We further demonstrate the scalability and practical relevance of this mechanism by fabricating tessellations in a bumper-like configuration and evaluating their performance using a pendulum-based mannequin impact test. Together, these results establish dynamic bifurcation in origami-based structures as an adaptive impact mitigation strategy. This approach enables scalable and programmable protective systems that autonomously select deformation modes in real time, with broad relevance to adaptive robotics, smart protective armor, and aerospace damping technologies.</p>

            <h2>Circular Dichroism on the Edge of Quantum Hall Systems: From Many-Body Chern Number to Anisotropy Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Nur Ünal, A. Nardin, N. Goldman</p>
            <p>Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines their quantized Hall conductivity. This invariant also emerges in circular dichroic responses, namely, by applying a circular drive and comparing excitation rates for opposite orientations. This work explores the dichroic response of confined, isolated quantum Hall systems, where bulk and edge contributions cancel exactly:~When the edge response is properly isolated, the circular dichroic signal becomes quantized, serving as a direct and elegant probe of the many-body Chern number encoded in the edge physics. We demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. The edge response is also shown to be a sensitive diagnostic of geometric features. This opens the possibility of characterizing the shape of quantum Hall droplets through edge spectroscopic measurements, without requiring knowledge of the system's boundary profile. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashutosh Krishna Amaram, Saurabh Kharwar, Tarun Kumar Agarwal</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the underlying physical mechanism for electric-field induced resistive switching in Au/MoS2/Au based memristive devices by combining reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD) and ab-initio quantum transport calculations. Using MD with Au/Mo/S ReaxFF potential, we observe the formation of realistic conductive filament consisting of gold atoms through monolayer MoS2 layer when sufficient electric field is applied. We furthermore instigate the rupture of the gold atom filament when a sufficiently large electric field is applied in the opposite direction. To calculate the conductance of the obtained structures and identify the High Resistance (HR) and Low Resistance (LR) states, we employ the ab-initio electron transport calculations by importing the atomic structures from MD calculations. For single-defect MoS2 memristors, the obtained LRS, HRS current densities are in order of 10^7 A/cm^2 which agrees reasonably well with the reported experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel E Widdowson, Vitaliy A Kurlin</p>
            <p>With the advent of self-driving labs promising to synthesize large numbers of new materials, new automated tools are required for checking potential duplicates in existing structural databases before a material can be claimed as novel. To avoid duplication, we rigorously define the novelty metric of any periodic material as the smallest distance to its nearest neighbor among already known materials. Using ultra-fast structural invariants, all such nearest neighbors can be found within seconds on a typical computer even if a given crystal is disguised by changing a unit cell, perturbing atoms, or replacing chemical elements. This real-time novelty check is demonstrated by finding near-duplicates of the 43 materials produced by Berkeley's A-lab in the world's largest collections of inorganic structures, the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and the Materials Project. To help future self-driving labs successfully identify novel materials, we propose navigation maps of the materials space where any new structure can be quickly located by its invariant descriptors similar to a geographic location on Earth.</p>

            <p>Low carrier densities in topological semimetals (TSMs) enable the exploration of novel magnetotransport in the quantum limit (QL). Recent findings consistent with 3D quasi-quantum Hall effect (QQHE) have positioned TSMs as promising platforms for exploring 3D quantum Hall transport, but the lack of tunability in the Fermi level has thus far limited the ability to observe a QQHE signal. Here, we tune the defect concentrations in the Dirac semimetal Cd${}_3$As${}_2$ to achieve ultra-low carrier concentrations at 2 K around $2.9\times10^{16}$cm${}^{-3}$, giving way to QQHE signal at modest fields near 10 T. At low carrier densities, where QQHE is most accessible, we find that clear QQHE is obscured by a carrier density dependent background originating from Coulomb disorder from charged point defects and Landau level broadening. Our results highlight the interplay between QQHE and Coulomb disorder, demonstrating that clear observation of QQHE in TSMs intricately depends on Fermi level and disorder magnitudes. We find that Coulomb disorder, as theoretically predicted, is an essential ingredient for understanding the magnetoresistivity for a spectrum of Fermi levels in Cd${}_3$As${}_2$, anchoring the role of defects and charged disorder in TSM applications. We discuss future constraints and opportunities in exploring 3D QQHE and quantum Hall effects in TSMs.</p>

            <h2>First-Principles Study of the Fermi Surface Topology of CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roxanne M. Tutchton, Jean-Pierre Julien, Qimiao Si, Jian-Xin Zhu</p>
            <p>Since the discovery of heavy-fermion superconductivity in CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$, the material has attracted great interest particularly with regard to the nature of the superconducting pairing and its mechanism. Consequently, it is essential to better understand the electronic Fermi surface topology and its role in strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The standard density functional theory method is insufficient to model the interplay of strong onsite Coulomb repulsion in localized 4{\it f}-electrons and their hybridization with itinerant ligand-orbital electrons. We have performed electronic ground state calculations on CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ using the Gutzwiller wavefunction approximation. The Gutzwiller approximation captures the quasiparticle band renormalization from the strong onsite Coulomb repulsion. We have performed an analysis of this effect on the electronic structure and the Fermi surface topology by varying the interaction strength and taking into account the crystal-field splitting. Using the de Haas van Alphen effect, the extremal Fermi surface cross-sectional areas were calculated to quantify the effects of quasiparticle mass renormalization on the Fermi surface. Our results confirm two Fermi surface sheets corresponding to the heavy (488m$_{e}$) and light (4.35m$_{e}$) quasiparticles, which is in close agreement with experimental measurements as well as the renormalized band method.</p>

The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junichi Komatsu, Kenichiro Koga, Jonas Berx</p>
            <p>We investigate the structural and topological properties of hydrophobic homopolymer chains in aqueous solutions using molecular dynamics simulations and circuit topology (CT) analysis. By combining geometric observables, such as radius of gyration and degree of aggregation, with CT data, we capture the relationship between coil-globule and aggregation transitions, resolving the system's structural changes with temperature. Our results reveal a temperature-driven collective transition from isolated coiled chains to globular aggregates. At a characteristic transition temperature $T_c$, each chain in multichain systems undergoes a rapid coil-globule collapse, coinciding with aggregation, in contrast to the gradual collapse observed in single-chain systems at infinite dilution. This collective transition is reflected in geometric descriptors and a reorganization of CT motifs, shifting from intrachain-dominated motifs at low temperatures to a diverse ensemble of multichain motifs at higher temperatures. CT motif enumeration provides contact statistics while offering a topologically detailed view of polymer organization. These findings highlight CT's utility as a structural descriptor for polymer systems and suggest applications to biopolymer aggregation and folding.</p>

Trained on bulk quasiparticle band structures and deformation potentials from GW calculations, the model captures many-body and relativistic effects with very high accuracy across diverse semiconducting materials, as illustrated for silicon and group III-V semiconductors.

            <p>We present a new formulation of the lack-of-fit reduction in non-equilibrium thermodynamics using the path-integral formalism. The formulation is based on the Onsager-Machlup variational principle, and it allows us to find reduced dynamical equations by minimizing information discrepancy with respect to the detailed evolution. The reduced evolution consists of a Hamiltonian vector field and a gradient flow. The reduction method is illustrated on the Kac-Zwanzig model, where we show how irreversibility emerges from purely Hamiltonian evolution by ignoring some degrees of freedom. We also show how to generalize the Fisher information matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions to the case when the two distributions are related by the principle of maximum entropy, even in the case when the entropy is not of Boltzmann-Gibbs type (for instance Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy).</p>

            <p>One-dimensional (1D) chains offer unique opportunities for nanoelectronics and spintronics, yet their experimental realization remains challenging because 1D motifs are often thermodynamically disfavored relative to higher-dimensional phases. Here we present a high-throughput first-principles exploration of 1D single-atomic transition-metal chalcogenide and halide chains, screening 6,832 candidates constructed from binary combinations of 28 metals and 8 non-metals. To assess kinetic accessibility, we compare the formation energetics of 1D chains with competing two-dimensional polymorphs at the nucleation stage across relevant chemical-potential windows, using nucleation-stage thermodynamic selectivity as a proxy. This workflow identifies 183 kinetically accessible 1D chains. Interpretable machine-learning analysis reveals two simple stability descriptors as key drivers of 1D stabilization. The accessible chains exhibit diverse magnetic configurations with different magnetic characters. We further uncover their pronounced magnetoelastic couplings, exemplified by CrTe with giant magnetostriction reaching 5.93%. Finally, we show that selected metallic ferromagnetic chains retain robust edge magnetism on superconducting substrates, laying the groundwork for proximity-induced topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes.</p>

This process generates a pure valley current which, as our central finding, exhibits pronounced quantum oscillations as a function of chemical potential. These oscillations provide a definitive experimental signature of the quantized valley states and establish another pathway to interface spintronics and valleytronics.</p>

            <p>Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are crucial components in high-performance spintronic devices. Traditional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials but significant improvements in speed and packing density could be enabled by exploiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds instead. Here, we report all-collinear AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) fabricated with van der Waals A-type AFM metal (Fe0.6Co0.4)5GeTe2 (FCGT) electrodes and nonmagnetic semiconducting WSe2 tunnel barriers. The AFMTJ heterostructure device achieves a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to 75% in response to magnetic field switching. Our results demonstrate that the TMR exclusively emerges in the AFM state of FCGT, rather than during the AFM-to-FM transition. By engineering FCGT electrodes with either even- or odd-layer configurations, volatile or non-volatile TMR could be selected, consistent with an entirely interfacial effect. TMR in the even-layer devices arose by Néel vector switching. In the odd-layer devices, TMR stemmed from interfacial spin-flipping. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a new TMR mechanism associated with interface-driven spin-polarized transport, despite the spin-independent nature of bulk FCGT. Our work demonstrates that collinear AFMTJs can provide comparable performance to conventional MTJs and introduces a new paradigm for AFM spintronics, in which the spin-dependent properties of AFM interfaces are harnessed.</p>

            <p>We report a remarkable bias voltage dependent specific negative capacitance in multidomain La-doped Pb(Zr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$)O$_3$ (PLZT) ferroelectric capacitors. The specific negative capacitance maximizes at a specific bias voltage because of emergence of maximum domain-wall density during ``switching" of the domains. Domain configuration changes from such an ``optimum" state if higher or lower bias voltage is applied at a much faster or slower rate. Phase-field simulation using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation corroborates the experimental results and shows dependence of the domain-wall length during switching on the bias voltage amplitude and its maximization at a specific bias voltage amplitude. Interestingly, the radius of curvature of the resulting polarization ($P$) versus voltage ($V$) hysteresis loop at the coercive voltage ($V_C$), as well, turns out to be depending on the bias voltage. All these results indicate a close correlation among the bias voltage pulse profile (amplitude and time scale), domain-wall length during switching, shape of the resulting ferroelectric hysteresis loop, and the transient negative capacitance. It may have important ramifications both in the context of physics behind negative capacitance in a multidomain ferroelectric capacitor and devices being developed by exploiting its advantages.</p>

            <p>In biosensing and diagnostic applications, a key objective is to design detection systems capable of identifying targets at very low concentrations, i.e., achieving high sensitivity. Here, we propose a linker-mediated detection scheme in which the presence of multivalent target molecules (linkers) facilitates the adsorption of ligand-coated guest nanoparticles onto a receptor-coated host substrate. Through a combination of computer simulations and mean-field theory, we demonstrate that, at fixed overall binding strength, increasing the valency of linkers exponentially lowers the concentration threshold for detection. This counterintuitive behavior arises from the combinatorial entropy associated with multivalent binding configurations, which tremendously amplifies the adsorption sensitivity and enables the identification of targets at extremely low concentrations. Our findings highlight multivalency engineering of linkers as a powerful strategy to substantially enhance the sensitivity of biodetection systems.</p>

            <p>We propose a mechanism to control the motion of magnetic Skyrmions through the generation of a Skyrmion number current. This current is induced and tuned by an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian that includes a Zeeman term arising from the interaction between the spin system and circularly polarized light. To capture the effect, we apply a first-order perturbation method to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, using a breathing Skyrmion ansatz based on the Belavin-Polyakov profile. This approach reveals that the time-dependent deformation of the Skyrmion boundary produces an anisotropic breathing mode, which in turn generates a nonzero Skyrmion number current. The resulting dynamics in momentum space form a limit cycle, whose characteristics depend on the external magnetic field amplitude, the Heisenberg exchange coupling, and the Gilbert damping constant. Our formulation not only clarifies the topological origin of optically driven Skyrmion motion but also points to Skyrmion number currents as a low-dissipation alternative to electric currents for efficient Skyrmion control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Shee</p>
            <p>Guiding active motion is important for targeted delivery, sensing, and search tasks. Many active systems exhibit circular swimming, ubiquitous in chemical, physical, and biological systems, that biases motion and reduces transport efficiency. We show that stochastic position-orientation resetting can overcome these limitations in two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles by interrupting circular motion, resulting in tunable dynamics. When resets are infrequent compared to chiral rotation, the steady-state mean-squared displacement varies non-monotonically with rotational diffusion. Steady state excess kurtosis and orientation autocorrelation yields spatiotemporal state diagram comprising three states: an activity-dominated chiral state, and two resetting-dominated states with and without chiral rotation; in contrast, the achiral(or non-chiral) counterpart supports only the resetting-dominated state without chiral rotation. Chirality thus enriches the dynamical landscape, enabling tunable transitions between transport modes absent in achiral systems. A simple reset protocol can therefore transform chiral active dynamics and offer a practical strategy for optimizing search and transport in circle swimmers.</p>

            <p>The ice-rubber interface is critical in applications such as tires and shoe outsoles, yet its molecular tribology remains unclear. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we studied premelting layers at the basal face of ice in contact with styrene-butadiene rubber from 254 to 269 K. Despite its hydrophobicity, rubber enhances structural disorder of interfacial water, promoting premelting. In contrast, water mobility is suppressed by confinement from polymer chains, leading to glassy dynamics distinct from the ice-vapor interface. Near the melting point, rubber chains become more flexible and penetrate the premelting layer, forming a mixed rubber-water region that couples the dynamics of both components. These results suggest that nanoscale roughness and morphology of hydrophobic polymers disrupt ice hydrogen-bond networks, thereby enhancing premelting. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ice slipperiness and inform the design of polymer materials with controlled ice adhesion and friction.</p>

            <p>We investigate recurrent neural networks with asymmetric interactions and demonstrate that the inclusion of self-couplings or sparse excitatory inter-module connections leads to the emergence of a densely connected manifold of dynamically accessible stable configurations. This representation manifold is exponentially large in system size and is reachable through simple local dynamics, despite constituting a subdominant subset of the global configuration space. We further show that learning can be implemented directly on this structure via a fully local, gradient-free mechanism that selectively stabilizes a single task-relevant network configuration. Unlike error-driven or contrastive learning schemes, this approach does not require explicit comparisons between network states obtained with and without output supervision. Instead, transient supervisory signals bias the dynamics toward the representation manifold, after which local plasticity consolidates the attained configuration, effectively shaping the latent representation space. Numerical evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks indicate performance comparable to that of multilayer perceptrons trained using backpropagation. More generally, these results suggest that the dynamical accessibility of fixed points and the stabilization of internal network dynamics constitute viable alternative principles for learning in recurrent systems, with conceptual links to statistical physics and potential implications for biologically motivated and neuromorphic computing architectures.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets host an array of magnetic multipoles, which are often visualized and studied in the reciprocal space. In the real space, the relative phase of the multipoles of the spin-density around atoms determines whether a system is an altermagnet or a conventional antiferromagnet. In this study, we approach these real space multipoles in altermagnets using a combination of first principles calculations and group theory. We show that even in collinear magnets, the local spin density is necessarily noncollinear due to spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, the noncollinear contributions often provide a more direct illustration of the magnetic multipolar character of altermagnetism than the collinear contribution, which is dominated by the dipolar term. Our first principles calculations also show that 32-poles, in addition to the octupoles, can be visible in spin-density of d-wave altermagnets, and they must be taken into account in discussions of the macroscopic response. Finally, we elucidate the interplay between magnetism and subtle crystal structural distortions in perovskite altermagnets, which provide a fertile playground for studying phase transitions between antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David González Méndez, Vicente Garzó</p>
            <p>The diffusion of tracer particles immersed in a granular gas under uniform shear flow (USF) is analyzed within the framework of the inelastic Boltzmann equation. Two different but complementary approaches are followed to achieve exact results. First, we maintain the structure of the Boltzmann collision operator but consider inelastic Maxwell models (IMM). Using IMM allows us to compute the collisional moments of the Boltzmann operator without knowing the velocity distribution functions of the granular binary mixture explicitly. Second, we consider a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres (IHS). This kinetic model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of IHS. We solve the Boltzmann--Lorentz kinetic equation for tracer particles using a generalized Chapman--Enskog--like expansion around the shear flow distribution. This reference distribution retains all hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate. The mass flux is obtained to first order in the deviations of the concentration, pressure, and temperature from their values in the reference state. Due to the velocity space anisotropy induced by the shear flow, the mass flux is expressed in terms of tensorial quantities rather than the conventional scalar diffusion coefficients. The exact results derived here are compared with those previously obtained for IHS by using different approximations [JSTAT P02012 (2007)]. The comparison generally shows reasonable quantitative agreement, especially for IMM results. Finally, we study segregation by thermal diffusion as an application of the theory. The phase diagrams illustrating segregation are shown and compared with IHS results, demonstrating qualitative agreement.</p>

            <p>A Chain of Springs and Masses (CSM) model is used in the interpretation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of movement of atoms in orientated FCC crystals. A force of dynamic origin is found that is perpendicular to the direction of the external shear pressure. It is proportional to the square of the applied pressure; It causes breaking of axial symmetry for propagation of transverse acoustic waves. It leads to a non-linear elastic response of crystals and to chaotic patterns in the motion of atoms. We provide an analytical derivation of an effective atomistic 3D potential for interaction between crystallographic layers. The potential is found to possess a component that has an anharmonic threefold axial symmetry around one direction. It reduces to the H{é}non-Heinen potential in a 2D cross-section, leading to mathematically rich, complex dynamic features. Results of simulation predict displacements of atoms that are inconsistent with the static theory of elasticity that may have been overlooked in experiments.</p>

            <p>We consider the asymmetric version of the Popkov-Schütz two-lane lattice gas with general jump rates, subject to the stationary measure being of product form. This still leaves five free parameters. At density 1/2 the eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian are degenerate.

            <h2>GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seong-Hoon Jang</p>
            <p>Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it produces compact equations that surpass state-of-the-art black-box models and symbolic regressors, improving $R^2$ by $4 \sim 40$ %. The resulting expressions reveal physical insights, for example, into oxygen-ion transport through coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</p>

            <h2>Transient Absorption Spectroscopy of NbOI$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salman Ahsanullah, Neema Rafizadeh, Hui Zhao</p>
            <p>NbOI$_2$ has recently emerged as a new van der Waals material combining semiconducting behavior with intrinsic in plane ferroelectricity and pronounced transport and optical anisotropy. However, its photocarrier dynamics remain largely unexplored. Here we report transient absorption spectroscopy of NbOI$_2$ using femtosecond pump probe reflectance measurements. A pronounced transient absorption feature is observed near the 2.34 eV excitonic resonance, arising from photocarrier induced excitonic energy shifts and saturation. The decay dynamics reveal an exciton lifetime of several tens of picoseconds and show density-dependent behavior consistent with exciton exciton annihilation and defect-assisted Auger recombination, yielding a rate of 0.4 cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to that in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Polarization resolved measurements further reveal a pronounced in-plane anisotropy in the transient response that follows the linear absorption anisotropy. These findings provide fundamental insight into photocarrier dynamics in NbOI$_2$ and establish key parameters for understanding and exploiting its optoelectronic behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunsuke Saita, Finn Bastian Molzahn, Clara Delahousse, Julien Husson, Charles N. Baroud</p>
            <p>Many biological, culinary, and engineering processes lead to the co-encapsulation of several soft particles within a liquid interface. In these situations the particles are bound together by the capillary forces that deform them and influence their biological or rheological properties. Here we introduce an experimental approach to encapsulate a controlled number of soft beads within aqueous droplets in oil. These droplet-encapsulated gels are manipulated in a deformable microfluidic device to merge them and modify the liquid fraction. In the dry limit the contact surface between the hydrogels is found to be determined by the elastocapillary number $E_c$, with the contact radius scaling as $E_c^{1/3}$, indicating that the deformation increases for soft or small particles. When multiple beads are co-encapsulated within a single droplet they can be arranged into linear or three-dimensional aggregates that remain at a local energy minimum.</p>

            <p>Bilayer graphene cavities where electrons are confined within finite graphene flakes provide an alluring platform not only for the future nanoelectronic devices owing to the tunable energy gap but also for investigating the quantum nature of chaos due to the trigonal warping of their Fermi surface. Here we demonstrate that rotating the cavity boundary relative to the underlying lattice structure drives a quantum transition from nearly integrable dynamics to chaotic regime, observed as a concomitant crossover of eigenvalue statistics and eigenstate profiles. Complementing the full quantum treatment, we examine the classical backbone of this onset of chaos by employing semiclassical ray dynamics. Our results position bilayer graphene cavities as a promising venue for investigating and engineering quantum-chaotic behavior in graphene-based devices.</p>

            <h2>A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michał Łepek, Agata Fronczak, Piotr Fronczak</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous Running Waves and Self-Oscillatory Transport in Dirac Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prayoga Liong, Aliaksandr Melnichenka, Anton Bukhtatyi, Albert Bilous, Leonid Levitov</p>
            <p>We predict hydrodynamic Turing instability of current-carrying Dirac electron fluids that drives spontaneous self-oscillatory transport. The instability arises near charge neutrality, where carrier kinetics make current dissipation strongly density dependent. Above a critical drift velocity, a uniform electronic flow becomes unstable and undergoes a dynamical transition to a state with coupled spatial modulation and temporal oscillations--an electronic analogue of Kapitsa roll waves in viscous films. The transition exhibits two clear signatures: a nonanalytic, second-order-like onset in the time-averaged current and narrow-band electromagnetic emission at a tunable washboard frequency $f=u/\lambda$. Although reminiscent of sliding charge-density waves, the mechanism is intrinsic and disorder independent. Owing to the small effective mass of Dirac carriers, hydrodynamic time scales translate into emission frequencies in the tens to hundreds of gigahertz range, establishing Dirac materials as a platform for high-frequency self-oscillatory electron hydrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Information supercurrents and spin waves in chiral active matter: Universality of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magnus F Ivarsen</p>
            <p>Recent minimalist modeling indicates that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that polar alignment on the unit sphere is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics, and that the two-dimensional Kuramoto coupling term naturally appears in the tangent-plane projection of spin relaxation. This constraint generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. Our results indicate that chiral active matter should strictly be considered a dissipative spintronic fluid, where phase gradient transport is ensured by the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Shot noise signatures identifying non-Abelian properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoran Ge, Zhen Chen, Yijia Wu, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes were first proposed in 1976 as topologically protected zero-energy states localized at domain walls in one-dimensional Dirac systems. They have attracted widespread attention in the field of topological quantum computing, as they serve as non-superconducting analogs of Majorana zero modes and support non-Abelian statistics in topological insulator systems. %In the braiding process of the Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, their braiding properties are closely related to the strength of disorder. However, compared to their Majorana cousins, the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes are vulnerable to the on-site energy deviation between the modes involved in the experiment. In this work, we propose to estimate the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes through measurements of transport signatures, which are readily measurable in current experiments. We find that the fidelity of braiding operation reaches unity when the current noise is fully suppressed, while this braiding fidelity monotonously decreases with the increasing of the current noise. Based on these transport signatures, we further discuss the correspondence between Majorana and Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, highlighting their similarity in supporting non-Abelian statistics.</p>

            <h2>Potential energy landscape description with Gamma distribution for supercooled liquids and glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongqin Liu</p>
            <p>The potential energy landscape, PEL, theory stands as one of the most successful frameworks for understanding supercooled liquids and glassy systems. A central element of this theory is the configurational entropy, Sc, which is traditionally represented by a symmetric Gaussian distribution. However, the asymmetric nature of the potential energy of inherent structures, Eis, poses a challenge to such a representation across wide regions of configurational space. In addition, the Gaussian distribution fails to represent fragile to strong transition, FST, observed in various fluids. In this work, we demonstrate that an asymmetric distribution, specifically the Gamma distribution, provides effective description of both Sc and Eis over broad ranges of density and temperature, T. The FST is interpreted through shifts of the Eis distribution and the curvature change of the Eis vs 1/T relation. In terms of energy changes, the FST is comparable to a liquid-liquid phase transition. Moreover, the revised PEL framework yields an equation of state that incorporates a singular term diverging at a glassy or jammed state, an important feature for accurately describing the pressure behavior of these systems.</p>

            <h2>Coupled-wire construction of non-Abelian higher-order topological phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iskandar Raufov, Dilshod Nematov, Saidjafar Murodzoda, Sakhidod Sattorzoda, Anushervon Ashurov</p>
            <p>This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies.</p>

            <p>We predict a new class of topological electronic crystals in bilayer graphene-Mott insulator heterostructures. Interlayer charge transfer creates a charge neutral electron hole bilayer, in which itinerant carriers in graphene interact attractively with localized carriers from a flat Hubbard band. In the heavy fermion limit and dilute limit, this interplay leads to symmetry breaking crystalline phases stabilized not only by pure repulsion, but also by interlayer Coulomb attraction shaped by band topology. Using comprehensive Hartree Fock calculations, we uncover triangular, honeycomb, and kagome charge orders hosting different quantized anomalous Hall effects at moderate interlayer attraction.</p>
